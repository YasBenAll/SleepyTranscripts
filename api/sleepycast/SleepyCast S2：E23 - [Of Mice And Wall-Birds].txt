  There is a world as tangible as our own. Impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense. A world enveloped by a seemingly unending ocean of forests. Buried deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little cabin. And in that cabin......is a bunch of guys, he's a bunch of bullshitter.

  On the back?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:54.177 --> 0:00:59.054]: 
  There's like a

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:08.959 --> 0:01:15.539]: 
  Oh

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:13.819 --> 0:07:29.997]: 
  Oh, holy shit. Damn, dude. It's like $350 on I Can Ask Cheeseburgers.com. Oh my god. I see your Facebook feed coming like a... I Can Ask Cheeseburger memes. It's the best place to get, like, talking Thai jokes. The first time I met Corey, I said, I think Corey was up here, he said, I Can Ask Cheeseburger? That's what this is? Yeah, question mark, and I said, this is my guy. I gave him a sketchbook, and he drew it again. I said, Corey, why are you hung up on this today? You're like, trust me, it's very funny. I'll show it to you. Put it up on your phone. You yanked the notebook out of my hand before I could finish my Angry Cat, whatever it's called. Grumpy Cat. Grumpy Cat versus the Uncat. This is what we had as a fucking refrigerator for the longest time. You know, you can, like, smell that from, like, far away. I remember when Shad first walked in the kitchen and he saw that on the refrigerator, he, like, hissed at it. He was just like... Grumpy Cat, yeah. Yeah, it's... Yeah, our previous... not our, but their previous roommate. I guess technically... What's the rule then? Am I... Am I... She technically my... No. They. So, no. This creature from the swamp used to live with us, and she had a token Grumpy Cat. Excuse me, then? Them, they. They. They had a... had a... had a... had a token Grumpy Cat fridge magnet. They fell from the sewers while they were down there scouting for food. You know what it reminded me of? It reminded me of those heads in the Disney Haunted Houses where, like, no matter where you stand, they're staring at you. I felt like those eyes were on me. Absolutely. Those 3D, yeah, those 3D paintings. They were simply inside the fridge poking their eyes through. They were hollow little cutouts. So, I have a topic. I have two topics, and I... You have a few topics, right, Zach? Yeah, Cora, you start with your crazy topics. My two are simmered. Well, let me start with the story first to kind of, like, kind of emphasis them on the kind of experience we had, so it doesn't just seem like I'm inherently gonna be racist. Uh-oh. Okay, that's a... That's a lot of interesting topics. This is a great start. So, I went to Wawa with Lexi, and I ordered, you know, just typical food, just Subway and stuff. The juicy Subway is your pickles. It was a busy day. It was a busy day. There was, like, 6 or 7 people who were waiting for their sandwiches. Yeah. And this fucking, like, obnoxiously fat black woman comes up to the... So, is she obnoxiously fat or obnoxiously black? Obnoxiously both. Because, you know, it just kind of goes hand in hand. That's the point I'm gonna get to. Yeah. So, she went up to the register, or she went up to, like, the people making the sandwiches, and I guess she thought she walked into fucking Subway because she was ordering her sandwich exactly how she wanted it. You know, most normal people are like, that's what I want, and then they order it on the little... Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. Well, she was already at the actual thing, at the counter? Yes. And the people were looking at her like, she was brain dead, but they were just like, we gotta go with what she says or else we'll get yelled at. But she was basically one of the rudest, just horrible person I've ever had the discomfort of ever being behind. Like, I want that one, and then the guy put it on, she's like, nah, I don't want four, I want it specifically two, and then the guy took them off, she's like, no, actually I want three. And it was like olives, and it's like, who gives a fuck if you have three olives? How is that gonna be any different than having four olives? It might squeeze out of your sandwich, your fucking sausage finger squeeze too tight. Why does it matter? Boots sausage fingers. But anyways, so... Just the little fingers. What happened was the guy ended up making the sandwich, and then she ended up not wanting something on there. She's like, I don't want that, make it again. And then some person came out with a bag of spinach, and she's like, and I definitely don't want this new spinach, I want that spinach, the fresh spinach. Just spread it, the spinach isn't fresh, I want that fresh spinach. And there's a line. Yeah, everyone's just sitting there scowling and waiting, and I'm fucking like, you know, doing those eye movements of the guy next to me, he's like... I can imagine Corey, like the teapot steamy sound, starting to brew in the background. If I was not afraid of getting beat. You know, but basically what it came down to was at the very end, when this bitch was just about to just fucking leave, and then get hit by a car and be done with it. Like she was ordering her sandwiches, like now put that in a separate bag, because I don't want that with the other sandwiches, because that sandwich is new, and those sandwiches are gonna be warm, and I don't want that sandwich infecting it, even though it was warm. And it's just like, oh my God. And she had ass burgers. And then she left, and then the next person just went up and got a sandwich, it was almost like this bitch went back to her fucking bizarra land, and everything went back to normal. But the topic I was trying to say is, I don't know if it's just me, but I feel like these old black people are so fucking rude. Yeah, it is interesting that you would feel like you had to preface it with, hey, I don't want to be racist, because if you've ever watched Barbershop, if you've ever watched a Madea movie, if you've ever watched any of these, it is very clear, they're very self aware. Hey, how old is the chicken you fucking black lady? I pressed the potatoes, you fucking fat, oh! Black big fat black woman, that's the character. I mean, that's a character that exists in a lot of those movies, and so I don't think it's racist at all. Made by black people. No, no, absolutely. I think that is an archetypal character, that is just like the nerdy white guy. Stereotypes are stereotypes because they're fucking like half- Stereotypes are stereotypes for that reason. Stingy Jew, rat eating Chinaman, you know, because they're also kind of stingy. Or even better would be like overachieving, like they'll beat their children if they don't play the piano eight hours a day. It's either one, it's never between. You know, I feel like there's a lot of the actress black lady or like the woman driver, the ditzy blonde. And there's a hundred white stereotypes as well. Stupid, ugly rat Jew. All those are mostly false. Rat fake Jew. But it's like, even if you were to watch like, have you ever seen the Hebrew hammer or something like that? No. Like, the Hebrew hammer? Is that a fucking rock band? No, he's a Jewish, he's like a Jewish like fucking shaft or something. He's like the, the high shaft. A Jewish shaft? Yeah. Hello, I'm so badass. He like throws a dreidel at people and explodes. They all fucking... He's like a little Batman. They all go to Christian hell. They all go to Christian hell. You can't touch this, more sugar. You can't touch this because it's mine. Throws lots of balls. At his armpits. You know, they always have armpit shots on their own. You can't touch this. You can't touch this. Guys, make a Roblox video called, You Can't Touch This, funny Jewish parody dash weird owl. The funny thing is... It's like they're very self aware. And so I don't know, is it a matter of like, you're just not allowed to say like, wow, Medea's big fat black and rude. I always at the store a few days ago, this black lady was like screaming at her black husband. She was like, God damn, such a fucking mouth. And she was like, what'd you say? That ain't right. That ain't right. I was like, I know, I know, it's right. I'm picking the right thing. What you talking about, bitch? And I was like, is this a fucking movie? You're like, really seeing this? She was like hitting him with her hand. She was just smacking her big giant black husband. He was like, damn, bitch, don't fucking touch me. I'm specifically saying it's old because you get like these, like I've had black women and black men like go up and order their food and they just take it and fucking leave. It's old and fat. I better eat old, old... Yeah, I don't think it matters what race you are. No, absolutely. But like an old skinny lady, you'd be like, oh, that's so lovely. An old fat lady.

Yeah, maybe like come a lot faster That's what I'm saying But even then like if I don't do it for a while, I'm just sitting there waiting And I'm really thinking and trying to get this stuff moving I still can't do it and there's people who can do it even without stimulation like there's people who like you know Sometimes people use like anal massupatory things, but it's like to me I it's just like even if I was ready to explode and if someone touched me I would just go everywhere I still couldn't do it.

He's like but he's like stupid again Cuz he was like very modest reading books and he's like I fucked her in the bathroom and stuff and Jerry's like you what he's like I don't even know her name Stupid it's just like really played on that concept. I think it's kind of I think it's happily true But at the same time I throw jack off for even feeling I don't think I've done that a long time I think the voice over is like two days ago I was in a show at NYU where the director actually told the entire cast not to sexually satisfy The entire duration of the rehearsal process well between rehearsals and the actual shows and small fact Bryce Dallas Howard was in that show Ron Howard's daughter, but anyways, that was probably a Two months tour. Yeah, good look with that. Who did that? No, I Yeah, you can't enforce it But the whole idea was that you know, he told the story Ruben was his name great guy Back in the day like theatrical stuff was really like this warriors way kind of thing You know there was a Japanese theatrical performance where these guys were hanging for ropes and one of the guys straight up just fucking like falls And breaks his neck and they just keep doing the show and it's like that's supposed to be Fucking shit and come everywhere No, but the idea that you know, oh, that's that's what you should be striving towards like that's a true artist, you know

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:11.903 --> 0:11:12.932]:

  Bye.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:01.502 --> 0:17:04.439]: 
  They put the gamakon in the dick hole and they jerk off and they shoot it off the

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:04.439 --> 0:17:06.767]: 
  the head of it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:05.181 --> 0:20:00.985]: 
  So far you can shoot the hunk. So Zach, Zach and Eric, those were my topics. You're just gonna eat his dick? What's your topic? My topic is rats and mice. Rats. I eat rats. So we, Nick will know this. We've had a little bit of a mouse problem in the house. We were setting traps and I think in my room alone, Nicky and I have woken up in the middle of the dead of night to, yeah, we'll see a fucking mouse kicking its feet. And I think it's like four or five just in our room alone. But we caught one one night and it was like two of you were like, let's go to bed, let's just get it tomorrow. And I woke up the next day and the mouse trap had moved. Like four feet. So I think my theory, it was on its back so it couldn't have walked. So my theory is that a little mouse saw his mouse for it and tried to drag it like like fucking World War I. Like World War II, yeah. Like Omaha Beach fucking drag it. Johnny, I caught you. Look at what I'm making. I think he tried to drag it and he tried to do a fucking small hole that he could have hit it to. See if you were a real trooper, you would have been waiting, you'd be on the edge of your bed with a fucking sniper rifle. Just waiting for him to come out and drag his friend and take him both out. Like the guy from Schiller's List kicking off Jews in fucking camps. But so we caught all these mice and there was one mouse in our room that we couldn't, we had, we heard like every night we heard like, oh god damn it, there it is. We put like four traps on for it and it kept licking the fucking peanut butter off and I was like, god damn. I was looking at it like, it was getting smarter. It was getting smarter. I was like looking at fucking like mice dying in slow motion on the mouse trap. So I was like, yeah, yeah. And so it was a little fat fucking, little fucking porker. We killed him like trash falling out of the night time. We were like, oh my god, he's crawling into a trash can like eating like poy pop or this shit out. And I was like, look at YouTube videos, there was this one fucking psycho who was like, yeah, here's what I do. You probably type like mouse rock trap. But this guy, I take a big mold. It was like a lunatouge trap and this fucking psycho took a giant boulder with like a stick. Little stick? Yeah, and it like would smash the mouse. And he ends the video and he's like, yeah, look at all this. And he has this, he's poking a stick. He has a stick, he's poking something. Like what the fuck? And you realize it's like 12, like completely flat mice. It was like, yeah, look at that. Now, real good. And there's also one where the guy was like, he set up like a shotgun to like get these chipmunks like like cute little chipmunks from eating his food. So he set up a shotgun barrel to like this little hole and would fucking explode the fucking chipmunks and they'd eat something. Anyways, so I was looking at his videos and I was like, okay, I was trying to find Yeah, I was like, I need some goblins. I need to fucking kill this little mouse and he's shotgun. Like a bully ball. I think they call it catching a mouse because it's not really catching. You kill you. You're literally murdering it. Because every single one that you guys caught, it was like cut in half. Like his head was just smashed. His eyeballs were like across the room. I saw one where like, one like it, they crushed the ribs and the heart was out of its mouth. Shadnite found this one video where this guy was like, here's how to set a good mouse trap. He has a really creepy voice and then he like, he puts it on his kitchen like stove. And there's like this weird like unsettling twilight zone music playing. So he's like, yeah, I don't think it's supposed to be creepy. But it's like motion track and the guy like the mouse gets caught. He walks over and he's like, huh.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:15.087 --> 0:17:17.449]: 
  I eat rats. So we eat.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:20.875 --> 0:17:21.246]:

  and sniper rifle just wait for him to come out and drag his friend and take him back.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:19.549 --> 0:18:21.996]: 
  I was looking at like, it's getting smarter. It's waiting for us.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:21.996 --> 0:18:22.249]: 
  That was a good one.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:24.257 --> 0:18:24.426]:

What's it called? Yeah?

Yeah, I instead of the trash can and there was like what appears to be a mouse in there I was like is this a joke? She's really mean I was like did you take the trash out and put a mouse inside it? What are you asking I think there's a mouse there's a mouse inside my trash can She's like what and there was just a fucking mouse sitting there shut up Was it alive? So I was like it's dead or something my theory is that it was crawling in my trash can pull your food It was crawling up out of the trash bag, but there was no trash bag in there. So it's just stuck So it's a little fat fucker. It was a plump little fuck too And I brought Chad down on those and Chad was like I think it's a lie. He shook the trash can it stood right around circles It's always okay Realistically we have to kill this thing because if we were I've really smized before their rodents. They'll come back Yes, but so once you made way to kill him out. It's not in the trap flush your toilet I said we could flush it but then it's gonna like run out of the toilet bowl It's gonna run at my arm or something I said okay What I'll do is I'll put a trash bag over the trash can flip the trash can capture the mouse in the bag and we'll do something And a flush it or something you're assuming that

What's yeah, how if you dump it on its regular I also had a hammer Oh, yeah, I'm only everyone who's hard just think I did not kill the mouse with a hammer because I'm not fucking Jeffrey Dahmer Okay, but I was like, okay, I can hit with a hammer like a rock or something. That'll be quick. It's in a bag I have to kill it. What do I do? And so like a fucking caveman apicyclopath I was like, okay, my sister little really tiny like if you even got your finger caught in a mousetrap You know, it doesn't even bruise you right so small force small blood force will kill a mouse Okay, so instead of a hammer I thought hand was overkill you took a book I didn't take a book.

  You know what this is?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:08.792 --> 0:26:27.287]: 
  Guys, their further synopsis about this!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:28.182 --> 0:28:42.878]: 
  I think mouse traps are way more humane than sticky traps Get it over with, get it over with I think it's stupid to argue that mouse traps aren't humane You literally fucking snap their goddamn neck It's gonna be any more easier to kill It's like a little mouse guillotine It's the best way to do it It's like oh no, poison traps are better Whoever thought, whoever thought that fucking sticky traps were better Was probably the same fucking people who thought catching people when they weren't looking And fucking cutting their tendons to watch them fucking follow It was The same thing because in my opinion it's worse Do you think it's more or less humane? It's torture Let's just imagine in a world Let's say in warfare Is this a trailer or is this a rat trap? In a world No, let's say in Afghanistan, right? Like let's just say in Afghanistan When we find guys we don't like, POWs, whatever If we've got some ISIS dudes or something somewhere in the world We don't like them And we decide to put them on a big old sticky trap Because leave them in the desert People would argue that that was very inhumane I wonder if you had a giant metal apparatus that's fucking snap their neck in two seconds What? That's better than fucking sticky trap in the middle of the desert I mean, we're basically imposing Sharia law on mice Because their only crime is stealing food And instead of cutting their hands off we're just fucking killing them for it We're basically We're cutting up the middle of the man, getting straight to the middle We're just getting straight to the fucking point We're like, we don't care about this fucking work We're not trying to fight for the freedoms I wonder if people in the middle of these cut little mice hands off and they steal food Like if they impose Sharia law on little mice You know what's interesting though? It's like the bigger they The bigger the animal gets The more moral Yeah, fly is fine You can do whatever you want Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like the bigger they get the more we care about it Like the more it deserves to live Like if you had a fucking cat or if you have a dog Or an elephant If there was a video of somebody who made an elephant trap that snapped a fucking elephant in half Do you know how many dislikes that would get? That would be So many Tumblr people would be very upset about that and try to make petitions That would be like I think the difference is it's also pest and vermin Like I think it's the idea that the fact that they're invasive Like it's like we're going out to the fucking woods and spying mice and then breaking their neck Well, when deer Deer sometimes vermin Sometimes those things overpopulate an area They eat crops I don't think they do all that So my feeling towards like deer or even like groundhogs and prairie dogs and shit like that I don't shoot them while you're walking But what if we didn't shoot them? I'm just picturing like a fucking like backwater hick Snapping an elephant's neck with his fucking like With a giant 80 foot long fucking mouse trap Just like it had buildings like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:31.202 --> 0:26:32.654]:

  It's a torture. It's a torture.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:00.531 --> 0:27:05.577]: 
  let's say in warfare is this business right worry you know what you know let's say in Afghanistan right

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:05.577 --> 0:27:06.741]: 
  But like, let's just say an avocado.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:21.945 --> 0:27:25.827]: 
  What? That's like that's better than fucking stinky trap in the middle of the game.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:34.484 --> 0:27:35.277]: 
  basically

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:41.993 --> 0:27:42.229]:

He's like, E.T. come save me! He's fucking like fucking virtual E.T. comes down and then His fucking maple leaf character comes out of the side of the screen and fucking hits ISIS off three runs away Oh thanks! ISIS falls out of the lawn chair and fucking hits the fuck comes down Chris Bors if you listen to me please make this the finale Chris Bors, if you listen to me please we want you to listen to- Ah fuck Okay? Do you ever have just like searing pain in your foot just for like- No I swear to God I was talking to Jeff about this that like sometimes when you're like moving your foot you can like move in a weird position and it just like there's just fucking pain You're trolley hoarse you mean? I don't know It hurts so bad But it's for a second, it's split second You're drinking up water? No I'm serious, if you ever have a weird pain if your stomach hurts, if your leg cramps, if you have headaches, if you have bad skin fucking call up a clinic The first thing you're gonna say is drink some fucking water I try to have like a giant thing of water, two things of water every day You know it's like the two liter thing or whatever What is it? Two liters or eight glasses or something? Eight glasses I don't know I'm cutting out coffee Coffee's not so bad as long as you drink as long as you drink No I'm actually cutting it out personally For what reason? Because it's like it's probably bad that I drink so much coffee regularly How many coffees? The question is how many cups do you have to drink? The problem is I'm drinking coffee and I'm no longer getting a buzz from it It's like that point where it's like I'm so addicted that I need it strictly for the fact that I woke up in the morning and I need coffee and I've switched it with tea, I'd be like tea now That seems to be getting more popular, seems like people are switching over to tea nowadays Specifically though they have this new thing which is tea and lemonade Holy fuck It's not a new thing Well they fucking just invented the Arnold Palmer It's not an Arnold Palmer though Tea and lemonade? What I get is not an Arnold Palmer, it's called a sweet tea lemonade It's got lemonade in it? It's not even sweet, it's called a sweet tea but it asks them not to put anything sweet in it So it's just like lemonade with no sugar and tea with no sugar, it's brilliant It does sound good though, it sounds refreshing It is because it's like tea isn't overpowering and the lemonade is just, it's just nice

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:37.712 --> 0:30:38.978]: 
  There will be no more

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:42.900 --> 0:31:47.440]: 
  I'm cutting out coffee. Coffee is nuts, as long as you drink it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:51.996 --> 0:31:55.270]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:36.782 --> 0:32:37.997]: 
  When I was a kid growing up in Thailand

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:37.997 --> 0:32:54.130]: 
  I used to always it used to be so fucking hot because I go in the summers I was a big fat kid and I was used to get these plates of shaved ice and the only flavoring because normally they put like sugar Lemon juice on it and it would be so fucking sweet. So I was like no no no I'm trying to be healthy just put the lemon juice. So they basically just squeezed lemons over ice ice

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:54.130 --> 0:32:55.007]: 
  I never had so much.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:55.007 --> 0:42:52.770]: 
  Diarrhea in my life, and I did it all the time too. I'd never learned my lesson I didn't care dude this is back when Taiwan was a third world country then open sewers and shit I'm sitting here eating just blocks of ice. What do you think the fucking ice came to me what I'm drinking now is tea and lemonade the Corey Palmer, you know what I realize out the sugar. Yeah, you know what I realize I think I think the thing about coffee That's good. It's like it doesn't really make me much either like it'll get a lot of energy from it But it's the routine aspect of it. It's not something hot in the morning It's like ah you cuz you when you wake up you what do you do? What's the first you take a hot shower and then you drink something hot? It's like that kind of you know the sip. Ah kind of feeling you're saying you want to wake you up, right? We wake up. It's I think it's really you want to wake up Zach. I'm gonna give you a little hint This is an old man hint. Yeah, you ready for this Yeah, especially in the summer wake up fucking hit a cold shower that shit will start your day You know I've never been a fan of cold show I never I'm not a fan of it You don't do it cuz you like it you do it to wake your ass up in the morning I just wouldn't feel refreshed. I probably feel like I just got a poor or something You know what I mean? I feel dirty the hot shower. It's like a cleanse. It's like to me. It's the block It's like I'm more tired away like I just want to pass back out after I take a hot shower Yeah, I could be a lot of it's getting some of that so I'll try to bless I'm telling you it also has to do with the fact that like coffee sign doing anything for me It's just unnecessary stuff. Well, the problem is we stop drinking coffee You have to have it to like get you back to normal you need caffeine right so me drinking tea is that substitute for caffeine like today I drink tea instead of coffee and I didn't have a headache coffee's where those things were it's like ever It's like eggs were like every other year that look like I'm gonna come out with a study This is the exact opposite thing that the last study. Yes, it's a coffee is good for you It helps with your prostate and the next year the site coffee is bad for you back in your heart or just gives you cancer I've heard coffee can cure baldness. I've heard all sorts of fucking shit for me I want coffee to actually have an effect again So I'm gonna weed it off just while it's summer and then I'll go back to one thing I'm glad I cut and you know I cut soda completely out of the mix I don't drink soda ever unless it makes you with alcohol, but even then you know so does danger So cheap and it's so easy to consume the good thing if you if you haven't had soda for like months or weeks And you drink it again, it burns your mouth that actually makes you go. I drink it right I've kind of tried to weed off dark sodas It sucks me one of the worst things it's like what I was younger was like fan or anything because I had my tablets Was like I was one of those kids you can eat like 10 Taco Bell tacos for you be fucking I'm not anymore 23 now So it's not as cute, but I said like you Fuck it's like now But when I was young when I was 19 there was a time when I bought like a 24 pack of Dr. Pepper Do you ever do that and drank it? Oh easy. No drink the whole no you understand drink it the whole thing Yeah, within like 24 hours. Yeah, cuz I was working. I was like oh whatever. It's like I gained weight I saw like I had always the doctor all the time like no you're fine Yeah, I just didn't affect me But now if I did that I fucking like I puke if I had one I'm just a little drink soda I'm kind of the same way there's like some black sodas I can still drink one as well like it's weird Look, I don't like drinking coke, but I like getting like coke slushies Well, it's good with like with like whiskier bourbon or something if you're gonna mix it It's a basic is the coke flavor. It's coke. Yeah, it's no before it what I mean Let's say back in the day. It's like hey Jimmy. There's this new thing called Coca-Cola. It's really swell What is this taste like to you? You wouldn't be like taste like Coke. Yeah, you'd be like taste like tastes like sweet molasses They used to say was like a medicine back that was like to cure your stomach elements or something really Cocoa it was coke. It was like far. It was like a pharmaceutical thing Well, the original Coca-Cola had cocaine and I know it's weird and it was a wake-up The same with 7-up was had lithium in it and it was supposed to wake you up That's why it's called 7-up because you wake up at 7 in the morning. It was your boost in the morning That's that's the doctor pepper pep is meant to yeah, there's all sorts of stuff Dr. Pepper is a mind-imation of tons of sodas. I still think that pepper is the best taste to me too That's what I'm saying like if I drink dark soda, I'll still drink Dr. Pepper from time to time I can still manage a doctor pepper. It's so bizarre see not a chance What are we made for a soda by the way dr. Pepper like pepper that's the last thing you want to have Mr. Sandman, it's just a you know the pepper if it was doctor pepper be a lot more interesting But dr. Pepper yeah pepper is like pepper. It's like doc. Would you drink a thing called like Mrs. Salt? No, no exactly it sounds fucking weird cuz but you've heard it since birth so you know, it's like it has no meaning I think the meaning back then it was like spicy The nurse was like what's the terminology for when you hear a word so much you lose this meeting Oh fuck if you say they were dog like 40 times it was yeah, I don't know what the technical term for that Yeah, I wonder if there's a word for when words just start meaning different things I think we keep saying word was good was meeting like faggot. You know he says faggot anymore I literally don't see faggot as a term. I see faggot strictly strictly strictly as a term for someone who is obnoxious and The only time I say faggot is to myself by myself when I say I look at my dick and I scream faggot You're gonna come everywhere But in general I can't think of like like it's funny cuz a lot of words I say like fucking shit It's just like it's common The two interesting words that I see two interesting words that I've seen change in my lifetime like in the last like five years or less No, not even idiot the two words that I see go from like common usage to quote-unquote bad is retard and tranny is one too Tranny is one in the pilot of always sunny. Yeah, I think I'm still like season three or four They they're like oh, it's a training girl like I like the the connotation of training does seem kind of rude because it's like I mean like it is what it is, but like when you say go hey, that's a tranny Very rude but boy, I'll let's say it's right. I'm just saying it's interesting that it went from everyone's a training like two or three years ago Yeah, like it wasn't always I know always things like the beacon of that You know why it's because of how rampant the transgender community has grown. Yeah, which is fine. I'm glad you got some stuff I mean, that's why I also I think sorry I was gonna say I just thought this is hard it is not is when I still can't wrap my head around because I still say it and I it's like nobody says retarded to someone who's retarded they say retarded And I still understand the Underneath because they say what I'm doing is what the one is that they say well well it shouldn't change its meaning It shouldn't change to mean stupid and I'm like well It's always the word retarded came from the word retard which meant slow right you would say my car is a week is being retarded Or it's in music. There's something called a retard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah But but like the train was like I was watching the car the actual original original pilot Was it a five-minute short for always sunny it has the training like oh look at the trade I was like that's really ten years old they would never get that now you get in trouble if you said that yeah Let's say it's right or wrong just saying it's interesting It's weird like it even like I would feel uncomfortable because I was looking for I was looking at new apartments And when I saw online that the nearby facilities were there was like the Burbank Center for retards Wow That's I'm not making it's a family business. Yeah It was very no literally that's like the name of it old Papa retards Just their last name Yeah, what if it's like jail retard and like like missy retard old grandpa retard That's a slogan of retard facility USA retards ink I don't know like I like I mean I brought this up another way to get to it But the right the argument for retarded never made sense to me because the word's like idiot and moron and imbecile all three of those were specific IQ brackets like it was like the word idiot I think was the lowest one I think no it was moron imbecile and idiot and they all referencing specific IQ brackets But retarded was only like the official like lexicon of a medical like the medical dictionary right for a little bit like that That's what's me and I got changed to just mean stupid which is fine Let it change what baffles me even more is that people who are quote-unquote retarded are no longer called retarded There's other words right so disabled right so that means technically that when I say the word you're retarded I'm not even actually technically saying the word that references the people who are Disabled no no people don't use it anymore right it's like if yeah if you were to say you are mentally disabled that is a specific I am pointing out right so if I say retarded at this point now because they don't associate with that word it is Un it is untaken there's no real group. Yeah unless you know some group, you know maintains that retarded title right basically You know what it's it I think it's a thing where it's like no matter what the term is They're always gonna find a fence shirt like colored is being used again now colored is now the right Pox yes, like that's supposed to be okay. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, hey look. It's a pock It was clearly not okay for a long time black white pretty fucking simple pretty descriptive pretty accurate black white yellow brown black red Yeah, like why I got five white friends and yeah, that's my black friend over there Also, there's those two yellow guys all of a sudden it's like what? Yeah, it was the weird one thing black white Asian. Yeah, like what the fuck dude. I don't know yellow fever It's like all these things jaundice yellow fever Yellow fever measles all these things equal yellow lemonade around the corner Milk milk are no Palmer around the around the corner chocolates made We've had nonsense topics about nonsense Whatever people wanted chill people wanted what they just wanted, you know, no topics The fact that my one of my fucking eyes is bloodshot. Oh, yeah, it's because he's Nikki's been pooping in his left I open what I repel her asshole. She shits right until And she sucks it back up the way She screws Groundhog again Like ask the face of Nikki. Yeah, I put my I put my favorite one of my eyes right there asshole such a fart See, I didn't even know Fucking who figured it out that after like Brazilian fart porn all these guys had pink eye and then they're like, oh Oh, you can probably build up an immunity to who is the first guy to just fucking open up his eye socket Peel back I think they had someone tied down and had continuously farted in his eye until I went away No, they built immunity like far on him gave medicine they fired on him They continue to do it till his eye grew stronger than they realized that if people just farted in people's eyes more often I do a venture you super here was like his only power was that you could fart in his eyes They would get big eye. That's it. That's like the superhero thing I wanted to do with like the characters Oh, yeah, I got idea, but they're just like terrible superheroes that don't fit in at all But it's called the awesome score. It is

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:49.784 --> 0:42:50.003]: 
  It is.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:50.003 --> 0:42:57.934]: 
  It is. It is fucking Colby Ossum's. It is, that's so fucking accurate. No, it was just, it was It was close to me, it was a lot better. It sounds like a good genetic idea. When it was going to be.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:54.255 --> 0:44:48.752]: 
  No, it was just it was close to he was a lot better. It sounds like a good idea What it was going to be was it was going to be like I'll just say this is not necessarily something It was gonna be like, you know captain crash and smash girl open their own like superheroes societal thing where superheroes come in and anybody can use Superhero so they have this big like group and it's almost like this like place they live in so new superheroes come in consistently and they fight so and People die because they're bad superheroes and they fight bad guys along with the captain crash and stuff But new superheroes can come in the ones who stare the ones who like you know it's based on like judgment from everything else So it would be like that sort of thing, but I don't know how good that would be I think there should be an app called super and the whole idea It's like uber but super where you get to hire out a superhero for a little bit You can like give them a five-star rating or a three-star rating if they're really shitty You know what I mean? I'm fucking superhero for hire. They would be like a guy who's like I am super quick runner guy welcome board Yeah, no, they're gonna be so many terrible. Can you give me a pack of gum? Yeah, I mean you feel like you have the money now, then you give it to him and he runs away Keeps the meter running so you get fucking that was actually captain deception So captain hindsight it comes down. He's like you should have put us You know it's funny about that fucking South Park character. He's a let's look at three part. He's only important What they just never bring it back. They leave some awful They leave some new cliffhanger the idea like this first or second episode He's pretty funny if they like out hindsight in him like he's like in hindsight You should have put the you know entrance over here and they're like we did Those commentaries I think they just said in the commentary that they just didn't want to do anymore They forgot those commentaries are really funny listening to what you're working because really three or four minutes You just pop them on they do every episode never listen to a commentary in my life Listen listen to the South Park place What is the fire like when they're in front of the fire in the first season like when they know it's interesting in the first season They did like the whole episode but in the first season they're like, you know, it's just like 30 minutes long Yeah, we don't fucking do this for every single one, right? So they do like many things so they talk as much as they want you with the episode we go fun back fun back Yeah, and they just do the next one so like four minutes each every episode

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:21.998 --> 0:43:22.251]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:50.355 --> 0:46:45.949]: 
  Yeah, no, they're always ready you get some interesting stuff. The commentaries are good just to put on commentaries in general Are it's stuff about the production? It's just what's weird to it though too is like you can't talk about the movie for like two hours Yeah, I think they did one for South Park too. I think and they're just the whole time They were watching it just like getting back the movie Yeah, and they were just like disgusted with it because they didn't like season like 15 or something Yeah, like we're gonna ship a guy. This looks terrible. What the fuck see that I wouldn't mind watching that I would actually Actually Like taken or something you see your Liam Neeson being like They're just getting bored I would do a commentary favor disobey law drives me insane when people are talking over a movie I don't care if you're in the movie. It's what I want you missing impossible and fucking Tom Cruise is sitting next to me All right. Oh, yeah, this part. Oh, shut the fuck up I could do commentary over fucking say it out included because I that is actually like 35 minutes long It would just be you screaming Comedians I know I don't listen all but I listen to some of them bored and I'm really gonna stop There's those rolling blast through a whole TV series or a whole movie thing I'll be like well timelessly YouTube videos now. I guess I watch speedruns when I'm not a body How do you wait wait wait you watch speed runs when you're out of audio because I was the whole point of audio I was like, yeah, I can work and listen.

Don't worry, those are my lights. Trump's face is gonna come through the clouds like the fucking bad guys were giving to the giant peach. The fucking like the ball that comes through the clouds or whatever. He's gonna pelt people with fucking condolences and dog poo. His big fucking frog grin. Oh my god.

I would kill myself if I looked up at the sky and saw his face coming down. Right at you. Yeah, I'd be like, yeah, like the fucking, like the movement from the George Mask. His giant face is grinning. But if he had his head and he adjusted his shirt, he's like, now you look done. Now you look great. He went back and he sucked back up in his face. Have you ever seen his weird old tweets? He had some, but he apologized, didn't he? He apologized for those. He's like, I didn't know how to Twitter before. One of his old tweets was like, my Twitter has become so powerful. I can make my enemies tell the truth. What are you talking about? Another tweet he wrote was, I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke. That was the whole tweet. There's fucking so funny. Oh yeah, that's fucking circulated like crazy. I was like dying laughing. Did you see the one he put for the secret in my over? He's like hunched over his desk at like Trump Tower. He's got like a Taco Bowl and he's like made fresh by the Trump chefs. I love tacos. I love Mexicans. And somebody like contacted Trump Tower. There are no chefs there that make that dish. He's just lying. There's another video. I tweeted it. If you go to YouTube and type in like Trump Ghostbusters, there's a video of him squinting with really strange lighting, bizarre lighting in his office. I don't know how the video happened, but the video starts off and he's like, Reboot the Indiana Jones without hair support. You can't do that. And they're redoing Ghostbusters with only women. What's going on? I saw that. There's no way it's real. I saw that. No, he's a celebrity voice. I saw that video. I know what he's talking about. It feels like a Chris Ford's video with editing. It's like he stops, and he looks to see that the red light is on. Then he has something else to say. It's all staged. Like somebody had a fucking gun. It's like a fucking ISIS video. Yeah, but I was like so. Read off a cue card. I was like this is a little trouble. I was like, I'm going to be in a fucking giant tower. So he called and he's like, okay, get the camera.

  There's dude is that one video like stickman drawings with the X's on their eyes and shit I'm told me about the new Angry Birds movie He said it was like people were complaining because it was like it was almost like social commentary on like the Syrian refugees What these pigs right they come to the fucking bird island and they're like oh they're friends They're friends with us, but really at night like there's still like a group that are like our scoundrels like they're not scoundrel They're like the groups are like no they're bad like no you're wrong They end up stealing all their eggs and taking them back to the fucking pier or whatever taking them back to pig village They need the help of the bald eagle aka America to help with the problem And what they do is they go back to the pig island and fucking bomb them Because that's any bird is about crashing into fucking buildings and destroying it And they're led by the bald eagle so all these birds led by the bald eagle are flying into the fucking pig fortress and killing them And then they get the eggs back you're actually kind of making a little sense That's what people are like it's like social commentary. It's like no it's coincidence Is it though how much coincidence though a lot of like the bosses and stuff some of the pigs remind me of like Russians or something like that Yeah, the green rush you're supposed to eat I mean like sir like sirians like they like caesarians they would like steal baby eggs and like fucking eat Like cooked them up every big omelette.
