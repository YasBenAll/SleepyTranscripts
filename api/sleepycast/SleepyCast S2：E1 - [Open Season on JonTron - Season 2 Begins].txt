  Like it's the only doubt it's the horseshoe effect. We've gotten so advanced and so smart that we're starting to loop back Yeah, just like how stupid can we possibly be and still serve?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:14.849 --> 0:10:41.393]: 
  How stupid can we possibly be and still survive? Wonderful shit brownie, a little salty. She sells all these different shit things like she'll sell us actual little like little bags of shit. It's bad for me just if you step back and look at alien right? The range of humanity is so fucking severe. Like on one end you have like theoretical physics, creating nuclear bombs landing on the moon. And then you have a lady selling ship brownies.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:10:24.265 --> 0:10:25.311]: 
  Little bags of shit

 SPEAKER_04 [0:10:41.309 --> 0:10:45.443]: 
  Such a vast, like, lady. No, no, no, no, no. It goes on.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:42.945 --> 0:10:43.502]: 
  I love you

 SPEAKER_05 [0:10:43.502 --> 0:10:44.954]: 
  No no no still It's Old Banana!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:44.954 --> 0:10:46.759]: 
  It's not just a lady selling shit.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:45.156 --> 0:11:17.151]: 
  They're not just a lady selling shit brownies. She sells them for $80 a pop. What? They're kidding. And then there's the people who buy those brownies and eat them and then review them publicly on YouTube. But the worst part is how polite they are. They're like, they were very delicious. Thank you so much. Why are you talking like that? People have shit between their teeth dripping all the people. I don't know. I mean, what could possibly be going through their head? Yeah. Well, that's what I meant. Is it like some kind of switch neuron thing? Like, I know some people say that like, foot fetish is actually gum sprung.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:10:46.439 --> 0:10:51.383]: 
  She sells them for $80 a pop. What? Look at their selling shit brodies.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:10:58.184 --> 0:10:59.432]: 
  This is how polite they are.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:11:03.482 --> 0:11:04.360]: 
  She will have shit.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:05.879 --> 0:11:06.503]: 
  I don't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:06.503 --> 0:11:07.195]: 
  I mean

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:15.582 --> 0:11:22.450]: 
  No, it's exactly like your pleasure center in your brain being close to your feet. What area? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:21.488 --> 0:11:22.568]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:22.450 --> 0:11:24.492]: 
  So sometimes it gets crossed, which makes it a very...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:23.682 --> 0:11:30.938]: 
  The foot shape part of your brain is touching the uh, right? It's like if you ever go to boards, right?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:11:23.935 --> 0:11:24.559]: 
  It's a freak.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:27.090 --> 0:12:20.820]: 
  Yes, right. Yes, it's like if you ever go to boards, right? For instance, if you've ever gone to a board with images and people who like I'm not gonna refer to a certain like red Chan But if you go to one of those places There's like boards like if you go to girl Chan for instance It's a place where people talk about stuff when they're like I didn't really like this image I didn't like the color of red they had for the blood I prefer a more darker tone so it kind of sets the mood and people are like yeah I agree I agree with the OP and then they're like more darker blood and they like have like reviews for pictures and stuff And they're just completely polite like you know they eat their fucking greens and veggies Yeah, but it's like how they act you would see them and they would just be like you and me But they would go upstairs and look up like fucking like Dogs getting their heads cut off. They're just like yeah, that's it's just weird. I mean I guess color I mean I guess in the same

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:30.533 --> 0:11:31.140]: 
  That's right.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:11:52.639 --> 0:11:53.534]: 
  And people were like, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:03.557 --> 0:12:04.992]: 
  Peter taxes

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:04.992 --> 0:12:05.970]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:16.551 --> 0:13:21.672]:

  Yeah, Chris, Chris, Chris, double that.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:04.932 --> 0:13:06.670]: 
  Looks like two hours before watching this.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:22.836 --> 0:13:31.020]: 
  I'm a party pooper, I'm sorry. No, it was funny. It was just like we were being loud. I can laugh, Chris. I'm the same way.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:28.202 --> 0:13:33.585]: 
  I can laugh. Chris, I'm the same way. Like, if I heard like, laughing and screaming, I'd be like...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:33.585 --> 0:13:38.445]: 
  Wait, what were you guys laughing about? Were you laughing and screaming? No, we were dead silent.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:35.729 --> 0:13:42.782]: 
  No, we were dead silent. It was the volume of the TV. It was the, okay, go, get these people. It was...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:36.437 --> 0:13:36.927]: 
  Baby, just a-

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:42.445 --> 0:13:43.626]: 
  You're just like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:42.782 --> 0:13:46.934]: 
  We have to turn this to full max volume. What are you guys screaming louder?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:45.499 --> 0:13:58.004]: 
  You guys screaming in the back right big we were we were well because well because there was like the part This is pretty dark. What so this is really dark There was the one part where the guys praying the guys stop

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:51.591 --> 0:13:51.810]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:51.810 --> 0:13:53.447]: 
  This is really dark

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:51.962 --> 0:13:52.418]: 
  수혜!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:59.202 --> 0:15:01.656]: 
  Okay, because okay to be fair and and and it'd be sensitive because a lot of times the Hold on if you rape a five-year-old the knife it's Oh God! Kind of maybe Hold on a lot of times the US targets the wrong people Not intentionally No, I know but so that's why it's like hard to laugh at but that said this wasn't a camp of like ISIS baddies It was a bad yeah no it was like these guys like running very I mean you tell them They all scattered when they when they see the machine gun shooting at them But but then like they're all trying to get away But at a certain point where a few of them realize they're not getting away because this thing is just all Seeing for miles and they just stop and start praying and then bam You just fucking and then the other guy stops praying and just runs away Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a pretty fun. Let me go. I don't say I stop praying. He's like, okay fuck this dude Like no you could see the way he was like oh God's not real like you It's not funny, but you could definitely see in that moment. He was like, you know what fuck the prayers I'm out of here bitch Like in that last like two seconds he was like oh that was everything the last ten years was for nothing Yeah, and just just in one second

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:06.981 --> 0:14:07.319]: 
  Try!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:11.419 --> 0:14:12.145]: 
  Not attentionally.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:22.945 --> 0:14:24.615]: 
  the machine gun shooting at me.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:51.227 --> 0:14:52.493]: 
  He was like, you know what? Fuck the-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:52.493 --> 0:14:53.995]: 
  I'm out of here bitch!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:59.294 --> 0:15:05.436]: 
  And just in one second everything you mean all those people they cut their heads

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:03.006 --> 0:15:28.437]: 
  their heads off and all of them. You could see him lose his faith but you saw the shit get scared out of him at least. It's really terrible but- Well it's ISIS. Not the nicest group. Yeah, I mean like I don't want to glorify the terrible violence but it was some- I do find it interesting that there is a subtle hint of like almost it's somewhat apologetic to the like laugh about that kind of stuff and yet on their end-

 SPEAKER_04 [0:15:05.436 --> 0:15:06.246]: 
  It's like, oh.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:06.246 --> 0:15:06.938]: 
  Hecht Billboard!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:06.938 --> 0:15:08.339]: 
  I mean he probably won't lose this game.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:15:11.511 --> 0:15:12.979]: 
  But, but... Well, it's ice.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:19.510 --> 0:15:20.556]: 
  It was interesting.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:28.437 --> 0:15:33.449]: 
  And it's something that's celebrated and shoved in our faces and yet having a reaction to that is something

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:33.449 --> 0:15]: 
  that we can't like well if they're gonna show his videos of their

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:34.360 --> 0:15:34.444]: 
  We

 SPEAKER_04 [0:15:34.444 --> 0:15:35.440]: 
  Well, I'll see you this-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:35.440 --> 0:15:36.857]: 
  I don't like me

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15 --> 0:15:44.502]: 
  And the fact that if we have a response to that, whether it's disgust, shock, or even

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:44.502 --> 0:15:49.412]: 
  laughing humor or something like that why should we ever feel ashamed about our reaction?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:48.417 --> 0:16:38.822]: 
  I think I'd make this I think I think the correction is not and I believe this but I think the the point is When you're laughing at anything like that, it's not that you're Celebrating their death so that you let's say you're not negating the fact that their deaths are good Of course, but I think the only thing is you're laughing at the gore and the violence and maybe that's the right the ridiculous nature of it Like why people people like oh, why are you choosing for a big love big that's like well I'm not happy that that the way things will concoct it baby But like objectively you took a guy out who killed a lot of people you did good objectively Kelly killer killing bit lot of whatever it is My what I think is that right? Being a country like ours I think that the reason that we get farther without violence is because we're so averse to violence that we even want to give Our enemies a second chance sure and I think that speaks for

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:06.490 --> 0:16:06.507]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:06.507 --> 0:16:08.076]: 
  The ridiculous nature of it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:23.972 --> 0:16:24.242]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:26.048 --> 0:16:26.284]: 
  great

 SPEAKER_05 [0:16:36.932 --> 0:16:37.118]: 
  Sure.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:39.750 --> 0:16:52.440]: 
  the way we do things, culture and America. So I think that's why even though we don't want to glorify our enemies getting killed, that said, it's so weird to see these people be dogmatic and kill us for those reasons, and then in their last moment be like, FUCK!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:41.674 --> 0:16:42.096]: 
  Of course.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:54.128 --> 0:19:04.825]: 
  It's like, alright, come on man. If you're gonna have a fucking, like, holy war, stick with it. What an interesting time we live in where, besides the ISIS videos, which are by the way an HD, perfect HD. It's crazy. Perfect. Russia put out some videos. They're not as like that, but Russia put out videos before they did the airstrikes before, everything else. Have you seen this? It's HD footage of the Russian ship from the Caspian Sea, I think shooting the fucking, the cruise missiles. What do you mean? There's HD footage of a Russian ship shooting missiles. Yeah? Did you see this? No. It's perfect HD. It's amazing. It's just, I don't know. It's super fascinating to see. Because when you're used to war footage, you're used to World War II, Vietnam. It's a lot of see, perfect HD ISIS video. Like for example, the Salamu series was executed in 2005. The only footage that has like a cell phone video, it's like 10 pixels. You can't see it at all. Actually, all the Kiev stuff, or the Maidan stuff. Yeah, yeah, all HD, amazing shit. It's all pure shit. Yeah, the whole Ukraine thing was perfect HD. It brings it really to like, it makes you feel like you're right there. I, Chris was actually in the office when I was doing this. We lived in another, the other fascinating besides the HD footage is the live streaming. People live stream now. Yeah. Back in, back in, back in November of 2014. Yeah, we were watching that in the office. There was a live stream for a Ukrainian apartment with it, just with an apartment. Streaming, the key at the, no, the, the Donetsk Airport. Yeah. You can see the light, the sky would light up. Yeah. Just, it's light up in the middle of the night. It was just, there, you could hear a war. It was live streaming. Yeah, you could hear like little, yeah, you heard the script support. Yeah. You also, when Israel invaded Gaza, I think around the same, around there, 2040, whatever that was, summer 2014, they live streamed that too. Yeah. You can see the distance, you can see smoke rising in the distance. It was just live stream. Yeah. Yeah, it's fascinating. It's pretty crazy. I think it's interesting that people still find that violence is the best way to solve these things. Still, after all we know, after all we've seen, after all that documented. Every, every time I think about this, I come to one conclusion. That's like basically that like, and not to be pessimistic or like edgy, but there really is no hope.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:58.836 --> 0:17:00.456]: 
  Can I say also? Stick with it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:05.890 --> 0:17:06.852]: 
  It's crazy.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:32.991 --> 0:17:33.379]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:17:33.379 --> 0:17:34.442]: 
  It's all the same.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:34.442 --> 0:17:34.729]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:36.349 --> 0:17:37.007]: 
  It's terrifying.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:17:37.007 --> 0:17:37.379]: 
  simple

 SPEAKER_04 [0:17:40.399 --> 0:17:40.703]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:42.576 --> 0:17:43.032]: 
  videos.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:47.048 --> 0:17:51.047]: 
  Yeah, yeah, the, the, the, you can, yeah. Amazing shit. It's all over the place.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:07.635 --> 0:18:08.817]: 
  It was pretty much our part then.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:23.633 --> 0:18:23.987]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:31.868 --> 0:18:33.606]: 
  You also need a

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:33.437 --> 0:18:33.471]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:45.351 --> 0:18:46.701]: 
  Yeah, it's fast.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:53.654 --> 0:18:54.936]: 
  After all we know, after all these...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:05.280 --> 0:19:09.330]: 
  No, no, no, I'll say also all clear for my point now. Yeah fall out seriously seriously

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:07.424 --> 0:19:38.997]: 
  Now yeah, fall out of something seriously right before World War two everybody was like the world's too good It's too advanced for any bad happen again. The war is not gonna happen It's why Hitler was appeased But you could just have one guy who just feels like doing that If everybody in the world right now compared to spend their military completely disbanded their nuclear weapons Yeah, it takes only one guy like you know what what is somebody to do stop me? They just do it Yeah, like by the point of example now. He's not a Hitler, but he's just he's just doing shit No one stopped him. Yeah, you know, it's just you could just do that you're bad

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:38.997 --> 0:19]: 
  My mind is that with all these technological advances

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:39.992 --> 0:19:40.431]: 
  That was all the...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19 --> 0:19:51.940]: 
  Do you guys ever watch the news occasionally? Every day. Okay. I'm pretty current with world events, but I don't watch the news. Okay. So at the very least, I've seen some highlights.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:44.633 --> 0:19:46.439]: 
  Every day.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:46.439 --> 0:19:46.523]: 
  And I'll see you in the next video.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:46.523 --> 0:19:47.434]: 
  I think

 SPEAKER_05 [0:19:49.442 --> 0:19:49.729]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:51.940 --> 0:19:57.441]: 
  here and there, I don't sit there and watch CNN 24-7, but I will say this, how is it that with all the technological

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:57.441 --> 0:20:04.495]: 
  advances. I feel like, you know when they do those interviews with like people, oh, they're like on the scene in Iraq or they're on the scene.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:04.495 --> 0:20:12.494]: 
  in Pakistan, whatever it is. That the latency is so bad now, like when they try to talk, they're always talking over each other like a bad

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:12.494 --> 0:20:47.644]: 
  Night call or bad Google hangout. Yeah, and it just boggles my mind because when I was a kid I remember they were able to have these conversations just fine before they were able to talk to people across the world somehow I don't know how they did it. It got worse. It's gotten worse, hasn't it? I was watching a Donald Trump interview. It was Trump. Do you know what I'm talking about? We were talking about Trump Tower talking to Bill Riley, who I think is also New York at the very least He's based in LA or something. Right. And he was like a four second delay. Yeah Where Trump would say something and then it would be cut off by Bill Riley. And there's like talking over each other like oh wait No, you first. Oh, no you first. Could be all the HD inputs, HDMI's and shit like that. Yeah, and they probably had a cheaper solution

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:14.654 --> 0:20:14.873]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:22.517 --> 0:20:24.812]: 
  Somehow, I don't know how they did it. It got worse.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:24.812 --> 0:20:27.107]: 
  I was watching it though, I noticed

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:28.137 --> 0:20:28.964]: 
  Do you know what I'm talking about?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:39.561 --> 0:20:40.675]: 
  And they're just like talking over each other.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:45.113 --> 0:20:53.196]: 
  Yeah, and they probably had a cheaper solution or something like that or I would have thought they would have got rid of the news. I know people watching the news their budgets are cut.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:49.045 --> 0:20:51.795]: 
  I would have thought they would have got rid of this

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:53.010 --> 0:22:39.644]: 
  Speaking of the news you guys ever feel like reading the news is the most it's the best way to ruin your day kind of yeah News is I actually I don't like reading the news It's it's all about it depends it look it depends what you're reading you're reading the local news if you're really Guy in Philadelphia gets beheaded. It's every news that does that though like because that's what makes the money They always focus on the shit But I think Sound like an asshole, but I do think that I try to stay informed I try to It's not it's bad to that is important to stay informed for sure Like I literally I my routine is like I shall I give a copy of a really news like 15 20 minutes Just go through all the news. Yeah, I don't lose everything. I do it like weekly because if I do it every day I just want to kill myself Like I feel like it gives you context what's going on So for example, yeah, if you see if I have a kind of T-Bow is your day that seems severe I'm like, oh, that's not severe. I've been following this for like two weeks No, this is just what happens like for example the North Korean thing is a good example, right? Right about once every year in the fall North Korea make a nuclear threat that will turn this US into SC vashes And make another video if you never jackson in the background right about blowing up New York Exactly, if you never see you never even do is it you see heaven says North Korea is good start nuclear war that really that does Really day. Yeah, but if you're falling through this going, oh, no, they're not doing anything trust me It's just a threat Hear about it from like Obama if it's really serious, but I just say it gives you context of what this gives you a calling your Cell phone. I mean just text you You know what I said? Yo KT Yeah, but I read I read I read I read my local newspaper for my like my specific neighborhood in New York and also like some some like See I don't do that. I really like the New York Post usually that'll give me

 SPEAKER_05 [0:20:53.331 --> 0:20:53.500]: 
  You know,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:58.394 --> 0:20:58.444]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_05 [0:20:58.444 --> 0:20:59.845]: 
  Yeah, news is...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:01.785 --> 0:21:05.042]: 
  I feel like glorified spads stuff.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:21:09.700 --> 0:21:11.303]: 
  No, it's every news that's been...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:21:13.564 --> 0:21:14.003]: 
  Deus!

 SPEAKER_05 [0:21:14.003 --> 0:21:16.500]: 
  It works on the shit so it makes you go oh man.

  We stop we stop like halfway through the ride like that's it dude. Oh look at that. I said 8th Avenue Dude that was it one of the scary

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:29.012 --> 0:49:29.704]: 
  So we're like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:30.447 --> 0:49:35.914]: 
  the story did you did he already know like the destination you just said oh he did know I just told him to let us off there wasn't a

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:33.349 --> 0:49:49.667]: 
  He did know I just told him to let us off. There was another cab driver story I had though Yeah, that was a personal one though. I had this one guy who was just like Fucking hit you. I sent him you to the hospital And he just kept fucking dude and it was weird dude. That was the weirdest cab

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:47.929 --> 0:49:52.182]: 
  kind of understand this whole thing. You know like one of those medallions costs like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:52.182 --> 0:50:10.440]: 
  Almost a million dollars. It used to now. It's like 600k because of uber. It's still oh, yeah Yeah, but still that's a big chunk of money It's absolutely insane because they what they do is they they lease the medallion the guy who owns the medallion sitting at home Fucking in his house or penthouse just fucking chilling was you or somebody that was mentioned there was some dude

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:56.856 --> 0:49:58.307]: 
  Oh yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:10.440 --> 0:50:14.997]: 
  where he inherited 10 medallions from something like that.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:13.124 --> 0:50:15.014]: 
  Oh my god, you've been rich for the rest of the time.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:50:14.946 --> 0:50:16.887]: 
  I like never worked another day in his life. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:15.992 --> 0:51:08.440]: 
  in his life. Yeah, you buy the medallion and you just lease it out and these guys then basically these guys lease the medallion from you and the car car from from somewhere else. Oh, yeah, the New York City taxis have a thing if you ever see the thing punched in the front It's called a medallion. It's a basically a license, but there's like only a limited number so they have like a basically like a stock market not stock market uh auction house kind of thing and uh It's really kind of fucked up and it's it's not really a good system I think the people who who drive the taxis there might even be a middleman between the medallion owner I'm assuming there has to be some like leasing payment plan or something. There is yeah, I'll say this I've seen a lot of really terrible jobs I think being a New York City taxi driver is one of the worst most soul crushing lowest paying jobs I've ever seen I don't know how anyone does it. It's a terrible system anytime they have, you know

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:23.789 --> 0:50:24.295]: 
  I believe.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:50:25.560 --> 0:50:25.594]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:25.594 --> 0:50:27.906]: 
  Somewhere but assign it to the sensor workers with

 SPEAKER_04 [0:50:28.362 --> 0:50:28.497]: 
  MBC 뉴스 이덕영입니다.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:28.497 --> 0:50:29.256]: 
  Oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:43.735 --> 0:50:44.579]: 
  sport kind of thing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:52.645 --> 0:50:56.644]: 
  I'm assuming there has to be some like leasing payment plan or something. There is yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:08.440 --> 0:51]: 
  when they have a fair where some where the people seem kind and nice just half nice right all of a sudden it's like It's like the clock

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51 --> 0:51:19.949]: 
  just part and they feel like they can talk and they can be themselves.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:19.493 --> 0:52:08.194]: 
  Actually are very nice a lot of absolute but they have to be so I've seen people stick when you with me when that lady stiffed Which still for you remember that lady was like I can't pay But in a cab no, I think so you weren't there. Why are you in a cab with her? No, I wasn't in a cab she was getting out of a cab that we were gonna grab Oh, and she wouldn't pay the guy and they can just lose a $20 fare Yeah, and it's like you already have to pretty much be perfect to make even a meager living exactly I don't know how they do it You know the Uber because Uber like it doesn't allow you if you don't pay a like if you You protect them well if you put if you put like a cancel credit card in yeah, you can't it says pay this before you Like give another Uber. Yeah, yeah, exactly So it has ways around Uber actually like Uber is not a better service necessarily because I like hailing the cab Yeah, but I don't know the NYC Commission needs to fucking I'm surprised that they even allow Uber in New York Well, that's the thing that tried to stop it

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:25.551 --> 0:51:25.990]: 
  which still

 SPEAKER_04 [0:51:29.753 --> 0:51:30.647]: 
  In a cab?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:43.152 --> 0:51:44.232]: 
  I don't know how they do it.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:51:43.675 --> 0:51:43.945]: 
  Have a good day.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:48.501 --> 0:51:48.906]: 
  Thanks then.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:53.699 --> 0:51:54.492]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:51:54.492 --> 0:51:55.504]: 
  Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:55.504 --> 0:51:56.247]: 
  That has ways around it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:05.950 --> 0:52:15.332]: 
  Well, that's the thing that tried to stop it when Taipei they did I think it was around in the Wow and the the Chinese were like fuck you we're gonna turn into dumplings

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:09.747 --> 0:52:11.502]: 
  I think it was a round and take me for a while.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:15.096 --> 0:52:21.711]: 
  To be fair, I don't know what to think about it because Uber's one of those things where they're offering a better service It's a better service for cheaper.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:19.534 --> 0:52:28.444]: 
  It's a better service for cheaper. Better service so you can get to see where you're going. Like you have a direction. The overhead is so low, that's the thing. They don't have to buy a million dollar medallion. You know what's crazy?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:23.972 --> 0:53:59.586]: 
  The overhead is so low, that's the thing. They don't have to buy a million dollar medallion. You know what's crazy? It's good for them too, because I have guys, they always say, I literally have had some of you guys who say like, oh, you know, I'm retired, I just try to stop when I feel like working, I try to stop when I don't feel like working. You know what's crazy? One of the only times I was ever politically conflicted was this, there was a point when Uber was trying to stop NYC from crushing them. So they offered free Uber rides to City Hall to protest it. But I was thinking about it. I was like, on one hand, I love the iconic NYC taxi, I like hailing them, and they are what I would prefer to see over Ubers, but I was like, no, you can't just squash competition because- It's a democracy. It is, right. So I actually voted, or I wrote the Senator, Governor, whatever the fuck. I wrote somebody and I said like, don't squash this competition. So as much as I do like NYC cabs, look it's- They need to revise their system, they need to have their own Uber. If you wanna be an Uber, be better, that's all it takes, just be better. In Zach and Corey, we're in LA, we got in a cab, and we were supposed to be going to the airport. He took probably 30 right turns. Yeah, what are you- Corey and Chris were the back, and I was exterior the windows. He might've been trying to scam you. No, he was. He was, but when Chris, I turned around, I said like- I remember, yeah, I was- What did I say to him? I said, look. Yeah, no, I was like, yeah, I know. I called a cab driver, he tried to take me, I asked him to take me to fucking Brooklyn, he took me all the way out to Jamaica for some shit, and I was like, bro, what are you doing? He turned off the meter, and it happens sometimes. Jamaica? It's Queens. Basically, my, oh yeah, Jamaica, Queens. My point basically is that sometimes you just have to tell cab drivers, like, I know what you're fucking doing. And then they're like, oh shit, they turned off the fucking meter. Like, I don't know. Like- It's just easier to do, especially if you got a cell phone.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:35.498 --> 0:52:37.067]: 
  I don't feel like working. You know what's crazy?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:44.239 --> 0:52:44.526]: 
  Mm.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:59.714 --> 0:53:00.625]: 
  It is, it is.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:10.092 --> 0:53:10.986]: 
  yes

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:12.657 --> 0:53:12.994]: 
  First

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:15.357 --> 0:53:17.078]: 
  All it takes is just to be better.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:23.204 --> 0:53:24.030]: 
  Yeah, what is this?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:27.085 --> 0:53:29.160]: 
  He was, he was, but he could not

  I think it might have been my birthday.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:59.205 --> 0:55:50.894]: 
  Oh yeah, Doodle! Doodle was with us! So we were in the cab. He got in the doodles. We got in the Uber and the guy, the guy kept stopping and he was like, he had a smile on his face but he kept turning and he was like, I drove 19 minutes to get you guys and stuff. He's like, I drove 19, we were like, yeah, okay dude. Oh yeah, tip me please. Yeah, he said that like, he, I swear to fucking God, he said that like five times. He was like laughing like, 18 minutes to get here for you guys. Stop! Eventually he accepted it. And see, luckily Lexi decided to carry a conversation with fucking anybody. So she just like, yeah, I really appreciate that. And she's like trying to keep him and he's just like, I live, I live right here. I live right here. It's only 13 minutes away. 18 minutes, I was gonna get other person but I come here 18 minutes. Yeah, you're gonna cancel your fucking asshole. But it's like, yeah, it's just like, you get these people, you just kind of like feel like, are you?

 SPEAKER_05 [0:55:26.492 --> 0:55:28.450]: 
  Eventually. Well, that's it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:55:28.484 --> 0:55:28.602]: 
  Bye!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:44.970 --> 0:55:47.704]: 
  Hey, uh, you're gonna get an ass with your fucking asshole. But it's like, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:50.894 --> 0:56:55.980]: 
  My fair part about ubers on the website it says don't tip these fuckers I Took the first three. I was like do I tip you like no don't fuck with me by the extra boy. They don't they don't I don't tip uber. They don't accept it. They don't seem to like one. I think I tried they don't accept it It seems like they keep the charge in mind and add a tip. I think it's yeah, but it's still super super cheap I think uber actually does factor out to be a little bit. No, you know, I've taken uber Oh, I'll tell you the one thing uber does that that okay like a regular cab start now This doesn't count for most cities only like really big like metropolitan cities like New York like hail service versus uber uber Has a surge pricing. Yeah, so that but but again, that's like that's very rare They are rare they make you pay double to get more drivers out in the road Could be supplied the man supplied the man lose like it's like yeah, it is but a hail service never has that There's very few drivers in the road, but everyone wants drivers so you're gonna pay more if you were a driver It's that basic kind of thing But there's also controversy about that happening during like crisis like a weather thing or whatever like

 SPEAKER_04 [0:55:54.825 --> 0:55:55.585]: 
  What is it?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:55:59.331 --> 0:56:00.546]: 
  They don't, they don't shoot you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:56:01.238 --> 0:56:02.369]: 
  They don't accept you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:03.162 --> 0:56:03.432]: 
  I think

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:19.817 --> 0:56:20.459]: 
  like a regular

 SPEAKER_04 [0:56:30.516 --> 0:56:33.115]: 
  That, but again, that's like, that's really wrong.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:56:33.115 --> 0:56:34.785]: 
  It's not rare at all.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:37.992 --> 0:56:39.139]: 
  was only to play the

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:40.742 --> 0:56:42.683]: 
  Yeah it is, but a hail service never has that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:49.180 --> 0:56:49.939]: 
  There's no, there's no

 SPEAKER_05 [0:56:54.833 --> 0:56:55.440]:

  Shinji!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:08.974 --> 0:57:18.728]: 
  Also another thing I kind of like about the whole like I know you can probably use the cab But with an Uber you can get like they have sizes of the cars you can get an XL like the long car and everything it's great

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:16.180 --> 0:57:17.108]: 
  Yeah, it's cool.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:19.180 --> 1:01:25.424]: 
  The same came out of the ground and he made the Pope. The Pope was made to reset religion.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:21.728 --> 1:01:22.994]:

  Oh that was pretty much just it. Oh yeah. 34th in Madison please. About 34th in VEKU!

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:54.263 --> 1:02:39.994]: 
  Has this ever happened to you? Recent Twitter polls revealed a horrifying 107% of all taxi drivers are terrorists. North Korean, Middle Eastern, Russian. Why gamble your life in a taxi when you could ride Uber? Uber is convenient, safe, and fun. It's fast, easy, good for the environment, hand stitch from 100% die-free hemp, packed full of essential vitamins, and best of all, every time you take a ride with Uber, Uber will donate $1 to help fight the war on terror. Uber, download the Uber app today and get taken for a ride.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:02:39.994 --> 1:02:47.115]: 
  You're not supposed to, he just does.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:52.499]: 
  Okay, he's not supposed to he just does I do it to be curious He's not supposed to just does I step out to be curious, but even- Okay, wait.

  That's what he gets. No more sports for that guy.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:55.317 --> 1:02:59.991]: 
  No more sports for that guy.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:59.991 --> 1:03:03.974]: 
  You've seen a few videos. We've watched a few gaming videos here.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:03:03.974 --> 1:03:08.445]: 
  I don't want any of the game curious. I'm just curious. I played

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:06.235 --> 1:03:09.660]: 
  I played the Nintendo before.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:08.445 --> 1:03:15.533]: 
  I've never been to a Nintendo before. Think about the past when kids wanted to be astronauts, firemen, race cars, all that kind of shit.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:15.533 --> 1:03:18.081]: 
  And now, you know for a fact...

  You guys just want to still raise money. They do it. They do it. Now, now, now they want to.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:22.941 --> 1:03:27.936]: 
  Now they want to be vloggers, let's players.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:25.439 --> 1:03:26.772]: 
  Let's play

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:26.198 --> 1:03:26.502]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:27.936 --> 1:03:37.690]: 
  Now first of all, this came from a discussion about whether or not, unlike the Occupation Day, kids are talking about wanting to grow up to be Twitch players, but let's all...

 SPEAKER_05 [1:03:37.960 --> 1:03:39.175]: 
  Yes! Yeah, hold on.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:37.994 --> 1:03:38.500]: 
  Yes!

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:39.175 --> 1:03:40.002]: 
 いやぁ Going forward

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:39.495 --> 1:03:43.495]: 
  Apparently I've heard that that is something to can stand up in a classroom

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:43.039 --> 1:04:11.946]: 
  classroom of other kids and they will proudly announce that they want to grow up to be a twitch or let's play. But what I'm curious about is when one of these major let's players or somebody tries to cash in on that and starts the first let's player university where people sign up and they take classes on how to make their thumbnails. What O-faces and what scare faces they need to make.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:03:48.675 --> 1:03:49.654]: 
  Yeah. John!

 SPEAKER_05 [1:03:53.468 --> 1:03:55.712]: 
  One of these major lets players

 SPEAKER_05 [1:04:11.406 --> 1:04:20.063]: 
  They're there. No, it's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen. Wait, can I tell you why it's not gonna happen is because that...

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:11.946 --> 1:04:13.043]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:13.043 --> 1:04:15.996]: 
  No, it's not gonna happen.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:15.996 --> 1:04:17.616]: 
  It's not gonna happen.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:19.202 --> 1:04:21.936]: 
  There's already Minecraft high school and you fuck me. Not yet.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:04:21.396 --> 1:04:29.445]: 
  Yeah, like no, but anyway, anyone who's a less player don't want competition so they're not gonna teach

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:21.936 --> 1:04:25.007]: 
  Like, what else do you need?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:25.007 --> 1:04:26.189]: 
  Anyone who's a less player?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:28.298 --> 1:04:49.071]: 
  That's not the reason. No, that's the reason, because it has like five years left tops. It's like vlogging. Vlogging is still around. But the bubble's gone, you're saying. To be fair though, vloggers never made as much money as this shit. John, can I get... You know, I just... Man, they're still making big money. No, don't... They're doing fine, but... PhillyD was never a vlogger though. But he was Spanish.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:29.445 --> 1:04:30.441]: 
  It's not the reason.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:36.482 --> 1:04:37.444]: 
  The bubble's gone.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:37.444 --> 1:04:39.992]: 
  To be fair though, vloggers never made as much money as this.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:39.992 --> 1:04:40.583]: 
  Shit.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:42.979 --> 1:04:45.004]: 
  They're still making big money.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:44.498 --> 1:04]: 
  No don't, don't do it.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:04 --> 1:05:08.444]: 
  But Billy D was never a vlogger though But he was spanned on like if you use if you use like just say games as a medium for comedy or something to get into like Comedy or like or reviewing or something like that? That's a good thing if you get a good if you get a good following for what you want like whether it be less plays whether it be whatever That's a good way

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:07.178 --> 1:06:13.193]: 
  Wait, let me just say real quick. What you were saying about that, I don't think it speaks to the format itself, it speaks to the people reaching other people. Yeah, it speaks to the other thing too. I think the biggest thing, the mediums, we got the problem here. It's nothing, let's play us the problem. It really isn't. It's the mentality of this is an occupation, it's gonna be around forever and this is permanent. That's the problem. And that extends across all mediums on YouTube that had their five minutes of fame. Like vlogging, like I said. This one's had an extended five minutes. It'll pass eventually. It's got a few extra strings. My point is there's nothing in here that's wrong with doing those things. It's the bad thing is people get to those positions and go, oh, I don't have to think about it in my future. This is still 50. You wanna know what really, you wanna know what really bumps me about about it and I don't know if I'm just being like a total hipster about it, but when I started with Game Grumps, and let's play as we're already pretty big when we started, when I started with it, we were kind of like, I mean, I'm not gonna say the first, we weren't the first, but like, we were playing like these old retro games from our past and it was just like real. You were definitely one of the first though, like 20.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:09.709 --> 1:05:09.979]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:05:16.797 --> 1:05:18.450]: 
  Yeah, it speaks its

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:18.096 --> 1:05:21.437]: 
  I think the biggest thing is that you just more eloquently

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:36.473 --> 1:05:36.945]: 
  Wait, look.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:05:37.536 --> 1:05:39.612]: 
  This one's had an extended five minutes

 SPEAKER_04 [1:05:41.265 --> 1:05:44.151]: 
  But my point is, my point is there's nothing in here that's...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:51.137 --> 1:05:51.559]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:52.217 --> 1:05:53.635]: 
  You wanna know what real... You wanna know what real...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:53.635 --> 1:05:53.837]: 
  Really

 SPEAKER_05 [1:06:13.193 --> 1:06:15.454]: 
  11 2012

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:14.070 --> 1:06:28.347]: 
  Yeah, I was talking to him. I remember specifically, I admired that specifically because all the things with that were like multiplayer reacts to 5-Eats at 20. No, it wasn't relevant. My point is all that was that kind of stuff. It was that caliber. Yeah, honestly. PewDiePie reacts to Happy Wheels.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:21.344 --> 1:06:22.339]: 
  He wasn't around yet.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:06:22.339 --> 1:06:23.166]: 
  This isn't relevant.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:24.533 --> 1:06:25.005]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:25.005 --> 1:06:26.204]: 
 ον...어려있adas

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:27.014 --> 1:06:38.370]: 
  Honestly when you guys came out there was only one other rivaling group and that was two best friends And they're good. They're good guys. They seem to be funny But it was like that was the only other one

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:32.481 --> 1:06:32.937]: 
  And they're good.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:06:32.937 --> 1:06:34.506]: 
  They're a good guy. They seem to be funny.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:34.506 --> 1:06:53.980]: 
  It was like that was the only other one We were playing these games and then like I felt like it was like really like trying to share my past experience with these games But then it just got so like every day. This is it. This is and it's like, okay Just like well, it's just like okay, then you're just gonna exhaust this eventually maybe not

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:48.479 --> 1:06:50.453]: 
  It's just like

 SPEAKER_04 [1:06:52.832 --> 1:06:58.452]: 
  Maybe not, I don't know. Even if there isn't a university, do you see after the bubble tops? CUT!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:56.258 --> 1:07:04.257]: 
  Do you see after the bubble pops? After the bubble pops? Trusted diversity couldn't make it. So after the bubble pops, do you see? This fucking McDonald's, you know what I mean?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:01.371 --> 1:07:08.999]: 
  So after the bubble pops do you fuck in McDonald's University? Previous Let's Play Sam. The Ambergris University. Did they have those slices?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:05.877 --> 1:07:10.619]: 
  Play the hamburger universe. Do they have those hotel conference rooms?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:08.999 --> 1:07:18.702]: 
  hotel, conference room, kind of like seminars to try to rope in like... No, not at all. Those people who expect to be hit with a sword...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:15.445 --> 1:07:26.228]: 
  No, not at all. Those people... There's not gonna be a Hitler Youth for Pewdiepie. No. Those people will take their... Those people will take their Let's Play Fagin' Transplants to all the juniors.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:20.119 --> 1:07:20.879]: 
  No!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:24.321 --> 1:07:29.772]: 
  You're not gonna have a room where you brush your pink mustache. It ain't happening at any time.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:07:28.995 --> 1:07:37.990]: 
  What do you think of the YouTube genre of Jon Tron videos that aren't you ripping you off? Yo, what's up with that? God, what do you say? What's up with that? We have to give a split. No, honestly, let me say...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:32.640 --> 1:07:34.497]: 
  What's up with that? What do you say?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:32.691 --> 1:07:33.079]: 
  Yeah, what's up?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:34.497 --> 1:07:48.469]: 
  Honestly, what do you say about John Tron? John Tron, it's weird because it's like that anger video game nerd. Yeah, but it has a style. It's not. You're editing. I'm just saying, you know, that's like the... Yeah, every video is like that.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:42.614 --> 1:07:44.436]: 
  Yeah, but it has a style.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:07:44.436 --> 1:07:45.415]: 
  You're stunning.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:46.900 --> 1:07:51.945]: 
  video

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:49.380 --> 1:07:54.645]: 
  No, it's that, it's that, it's that, it's that, it's that everything. It's that crazy editing where it's like, it's something that would make the game.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:51.945 --> 1:08:10.002]: 
  Crazy editing where you know you can keep it here. I'll say this here's something strange about that It's like I did that yellow tick stuff a lot and then when I started seeing it more often I was just like I feel like I can't do it anymore. Yeah, it's not it's bullshit I don't know what to say other than I don't know that's what happens when something you are watching

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:03.994 --> 1:08:05.496]: 
  Yeah, I don't know. It's not, it's bullsh-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:05.496 --> 1:08:05.952]: 
  I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:09.529 --> 1:08:11.115]: 
  You know what you are, you eat what you eat.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:11.639 --> 1:08:25.948]: 
  I was gonna say that happens to Chris sometimes when we do a gag or a joke or something and other people do it a lot and we're like, oh, we can't do it anymore. Yeah, I feel like I can't do it anymore. It's really a weird feeling. It's almost like it's a good but bad feeling. No, it's bad. Okay, yeah, like when you make dake memes, that hot spicy dake joke meme.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:08:16.617 --> 1:08:16.819]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:08:20.245 --> 1:08:20.886]: 
  No, it's bad.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:08:20.886 --> 1:08:21.308]: 
  오케이

 SPEAKER_05 [1:08:23.788 --> 1:08:23.839]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:24.497 --> 1:08:30.993]: 
  Or, already say stuff like water people, water people, uh, son catch off.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:31.618 --> 1:09:02.600]: 
  Sometimes I feel like even I'm like exhausted and I'm like I wonder if people even want to see this anymore No, I'm curious because this happens to you This isn't really, you know, but I'm curious to ask about this because I've been around you in this time before It happened today actually. What is your opinion? How do you feel realistically about people stopping you? Stopping me? I don't mind it. If people are genuinely like, oh my god I really want to talk to this person like referring to me Right. I would like to specifically, you even comment on it because we were at a coffee shop And someone was like, hey, I love your video. You walked out and that was the whole thing That's good!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:35.448 --> 1:08:37.288]: 
  Oh curious, guess what happens to you?

 SPEAKER_04 [1:08:45.794 --> 1:08:46.957]: 
  It's fine.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:08:59.613 --> 1:09:00.288]: 
  That's good!

 SPEAKER_05 [1:09:00.288 --> 1:09:21.939]: 
  Like oh those are cool to rent I'll give a little anecdote was when we were with John John was just standing there and this guy comes up and goes grabs John by the fucking neck and goes are you John? and John was like yeah and then John was being really courteous and nice to this guy I was like yeah you got a picture and all this but this guy was like like literally just grabbed the human being by the fucking neck I shot him

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:20.961 --> 1:09:27.947]: 
  It's not just that. It's also, he did say something like he insulted you, which was like... They insulted Niall? Oh, they, they he did?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:21.939 --> 1:09:23.374]: 
  It's not just that.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:09:26.529 --> 1:09:38.781]: 
  Oh, they didn't tell me that this guy John said something like oh, he's a Brad Pitt as a joke And then this guy goes you're looking horrible for being Brad Pitt. Oh, yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:27.947 --> 1:09:29.685]: 
  You didn't tell me that this guy, uh...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:37.667 --> 1:09:43.067]: 
  Yeah, that's right. I was like, well, that's right. Now it could only look down. You're gonna get full fuck off.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:41.532 --> 1:09:57.495]: 
  Fuck off. Something really similar happened to me when I was, when Aaron was in Ireland with me. He noticed this all in a group was me, Aaron, Suzy, Barry, and then... Yeah, and me too. Oh, and you, and the kid just runs up to me and fucking grabs me like a bear. I was like, what the fuck? And he was like, bitch!

 SPEAKER_05 [1:09:49.497 --> 1:09:51.640]: 
  Yeah, and me too. Oh, and you, I remember that.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:09:53.884 --> 1:10:14.134]: 
  I was like what the fuck? And he was like big fat and you ran away and I was like also that day we were I thought he robbed me or something. We went to McDonald's that day and the guy who worked at McDonald's was cleaning his tray and he dropped his tray when he saw Aaron. And then he came over to us with like a piece of paper and he goes or with a napkin and he goes can you sign this and he said

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:55.437 --> 1:09:55.994]: 
  What the f-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:01.242 --> 1:10:04.414]: 
  We went to McDonald's. We went to McDonald's that day.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:14.134 --> 1:10:17.779]: 
  asked like me to sign it and I was like hey I'm signing an auto you didn't know who you were let me just

 SPEAKER_05 [1:10:16.733 --> 1:10:19.720]: 
  You didn't know who you were? You know what? You know it's nobody, honestly.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:17.442 --> 1:10:31.347]: 
  You know what? You thought it was nobody. I have something to say about this. I think it's a product of the times. I think anybody who grew up in our generation would, maybe they would, I don't know. Or at least some people in our generation, but one previous, would never do that shit where they run up and hug you. I could.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:29.777 --> 1:11:03.949]: 
  I couldn't hug you. Yeah, when I first met like real big fish because I met him You know this is before I made the music video for them. So if I was like hey, I made that music video They probably know who I was yeah, they do Sound arrogant, but they follow me on Twitter because they know you anyways I I came up to them he was going to his car with his girlfriend in his hand and you know People were stopping him prior and I went up to him and I couldn't say anything. I was just like oh the big fan It was like oh, he's like mm-hmm, and I'm like He's like oh and then he left because I couldn't say anything. I think but it's like sure I think the nature of

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:40.206 --> 1:10:45.437]: 
  Yeah, they do know. That probably makes me sound arrogant. They follow me on Twitter because they know you. It was.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:45.437 --> 1:10:45.741]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:03.949 --> 1:11:10.952]: 
  fandom has changed so much because the nature of celebrity has changed. Before bands and celebrities they were such a distant thing.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:10.935 --> 1:11:15.728]: 
  Things you saw on TV or listen on the radio, but nowadays with like YouTube and you feel like you're close

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:14.699 --> 1:11:18.445]: 
  You feel like you're closer. Facebook, Twitter, no they do.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:18.445 --> 1:11:19.795]: 
  The fans absolutely. Exactly.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:19.795 --> 1:11:23.997]: 
  feel like they are like in some cases that they're your friends and realistic

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:23.035 --> 1:11:24.942]: 
  And realistic, realistic.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:23.997 --> 1:12:08.749]: 
  I think that that become a part of the narrative. YouTube makes it, you know, the strength of YouTube is that you do see that as a place. I used to see comments on gamers that would be like, you know, people listen to you guys and pretend they're your friends. Yeah, they think, that's the thing they think. But I think going back to like the, let them cut you up, I was going to say this before, but the thing about like, you know, the new kind of wave of people not understanding social balance and kind of grabbing you, I think that's also just a natural way of practicing people being online. You know, that does attract a little bit bigger of a more socially kind of inept to some degree. I guess. To some degree socially inept, you know, because I mean, people for the most part who use, who consume a lot of content generally get wrapped up and stuff to that degree, like obsessive, at least a portion of that is gonna be a little too soon. I also, yeah, but that's,

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:24.942 --> 1:11:26.933]: 
  that become a part of the narrative.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:25.617 --> 1:11:27.254]: 
  Well, YouTube. YouTube.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:11:30.055 --> 1:11:31.455]: 
  you do see that.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:11:36.990 --> 1:11:39.167]: 
  That's the thing, big thing.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:41.884]: 
  Not a chance.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:10.605]: 
  I also do really think that there's like

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:10.049 --> 1:12:15.567]: 
  I'm not saying it's everybody but I'm saying at least the portion people you're bound to some people like that. I don't know what you think.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:50.903]: 
  I also do think there's like this buddy factor too. Like the more they listen to you, the more they listen to you, the more comfortable, the more stuff you reveal about yourself, the more comfortable they are around you, the more they'll listen to you outside of what you do and look into more of your stuff and see you. And then when you meet up, they will be like, and I honestly prefer that. I would completely fucking love, and when I was at Macfest last time, I ran into a ton of people who were just really cool, but it's like I'm way more terrified of someone who was just terrified to be near me. Like if they're afraid to talk to me, then that's just like that makes me uncomfortable. But at the same time, no matter how close I am,

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:19.499 --> 1:12:20.359]: 
  He's for you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:49.907 --> 1:12:52.928]: 
  No matter how close I am to certain people, it's not like I just ran

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:50.498 --> 1:13:31.943]: 
  close I am to certain people it's not like I just randomly see you and just run up to you and give you a hug I think it should also be noted that the people who you know think of you as their close friends They're not usually exclusive with people who are socially up. It just happens to be it just happens to be some people Happen to be some people. Yeah, huh to answer your question Well, it doesn't bother me at all like the the whole fandom thing until they fucking break a fucking like physical boundary or social boundary If you if you acknowledge that I'm trying to have a flow with my day and I don't want to stop And fucking I maybe I'm on my way to something because they were the eyes for you If you're sitting on the eating is if you're on the we've you're that's the one that piss me off I'm fucking eating. Oh and somebody talks to me. It's like dude. I'm fucking eating

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:52.202 --> 1:12:52.574]: 
  the guy

 SPEAKER_04 [1:12:54.497 --> 1:12:57.450]: 
  up to you and give you a heart.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:13:07.525 --> 1:13:07.997]: 
  That's so cool.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:07.997 --> 1:13:09.297]: 
  In here!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:15.962 --> 1:13:16.452]: 
 しずこ

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:16.452 --> 1:13:17.903]: 
  boundary or social boundary.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:27.623 --> 1:13:27.859]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:13:30.576 --> 1:13:30.947]: 
  It's like

 SPEAKER_05 [1:13:31.740 --> 1:13:34.710]: 
  Eating is the worst apparently.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:33.715 --> 1:13:49.949]: 
  And there are times I feel like if you get, if you run into people and you're in a mood, like sometimes like, you know, a stamp or whatever, we have this phone call line or whatever, it's like we're opening up the line right now, like when we're walking and someone's like, oh my god, that was so, and it's like, hey, you know what, I'm walking somewhere. You want to talk? Let's just cross-talk.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:37.394 --> 1:13:40.043]: 
  Like sometimes like you know, stamp or whatever

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:41.494 --> 1:13:43.992]: 
  It's like we're opening up the line right now like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:49.949 --> 1:13:58.150]: 
  Cross the street, what do you have to say? You know what I mean? Like, you invited in. Let's have this conversation. Sure, that's fine. Like, they're literally stopping the shit. That's when it fucking...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:54.775 --> 1:13:54.944]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:54.944 --> 1:13:55.079]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:57.897 --> 1:13:59.787]: 
  If they stop it, yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:13:59.112 --> 1:14:01.575]: 
  I didn't do that to anybody else.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:00.495 --> 1:15:28.195]: 
  I also I also I don't know if I don't know if our positions are specifically because you know our experience But like if I saw something like my soul like Larry David or something I would rip it stop and be like I'd be like dude.

I would say it's one of the best comedies of all time, and one of the best... It's amazing. So speaking, because it has it all, it has the comedy, it has the feels, it has... I know, I remember it was really good, because it has like, you know, two, but I watched it, and forgot how great it was. It's amazing, it's amazing. It's 10 out of 10, honestly. It is, it is. It is 10 years old.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:33:36.936 --> 1:33:39.501]: 
  That's not quite this, that's not quite, I think the question's asking.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:33:39.501 --> 1:33:41.594]: 
  Yeah, like oh, I would say something

 SPEAKER_05 [1:33:43.500 --> 1:33:44.952]: 
  I forgot how good it was

 SPEAKER_05 [1:33:46.167 --> 1:33:47.112]: 
  musicals of all time.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:33:49.997 --> 1:33:50.318]: 
  It is

 SPEAKER_05 [1:33:50.318 --> 1:33:51.499]: 
  It's amazing.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:33:51.499 --> 1:33:52.124]: 
  because

 SPEAKER_04 [1:33:54.942 --> 1:33:55.954]: 
  I was like...

 SPEAKER_04 [1:33:59.397 --> 1:34:00.494]: 
  It was amazing.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:34:00.494 --> 1:34:04.999]: 
  I'm not gonna be 10 years older because I was old enough to be in

 SPEAKER_04 [1:34:01.439 --> 1:34:02.755]: 
  It is.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:34:04.999 --> 1:34:24.557]: 
  theaters when that movie came out and we couldn't get any seats but the first fucking row and when the the uncle Farquhar song came on literally myself and a few others not ironically not in any other way we were on the floor just because we'd never seen anything like that on the big screen the way the way it is is like

 SPEAKER_03 [1:34:22.988 --> 1:34:26.498]: 
  The way it is is like the movie is totally clean until that

 SPEAKER_04 [1:34:26.498 --> 1:34:28.624]: 
  Yes, it just all comes out of that one

 SPEAKER_00 [1:34:28.169 --> 1:34:35.492]: 
  Oh, and just like the scene with yeah the Canadian like the police officer in the street Yeah, doing the fart like dude. Let me

 SPEAKER_02 [1:34:33.113 --> 1:34:34.952]: 
  Yeah, yeah. We have to start doing the fart like...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:34:34.952 --> 1:35:37.896]: 
  I listen to the commentary that they mentioned the fact that they wanted to time it to where people in the movie were leaving the theater, the same people in real theater were leaving the theater with their kids. So in the part of Uncle Fucker, it starts happening. In the movie, the people start leaving the theater. And they wanted to time it so people in the real theater start leaving too. I think it's really small to do. Dude, dude, let me just say, I was like, I don't remember when that came out, 1999? Yeah, 1997. No, no, it was 1999. Anyways, I was right at age 10 when that shit was out on DVD and stuff. And that's when like I'd heard about it obviously and we'd heard it had the record fucks in any movie ever. Right, 200 whatever. So you were the kids in that? I was, I was me. Dude, a magical time. A magical, perfect moment in history. I was 10 years old. I rented it. I had my, I tricked my aunt into renting it for me. I said, it's just a cartoon because my uncle will let me do it. And he's looking at the cover. They're like, oh yeah. I bought it. I watched it fucking like 10 times in a row. My uncle found it. I rented it. And he said, I'm taking you home to your parents and I cried. And I cried. And he felt bad. He's like, okay, we're not going to take you back. All right, I get it. I get it. That movie changed my life.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:34:35.492 --> 1:34:36.522]: 
  I love you.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:34:57.464 --> 1:34:58.442]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:34:58.442 --> 1:34:59.944]:

  Right, 200 lepers. So you were the kid.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:35:09.006 --> 1:35:09.580]: 
  Whatever

 SPEAKER_05 [1:35:10.947 --> 1:35:11.824]: 
  I was

 SPEAKER_01 [1:35:17.140 --> 1:35:17.579]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_05 [1:35:23.333 --> 1:35:25.746]: 
  And they just look at the cover and they're like, oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:35:32.834 --> 1:35:33.576]: 
  I Groot

 SPEAKER_02 [1:35:37.694 --> 1:35:43.499]: 
  my life do they see the movie and fucking understand why I still think that's so perfect for so many

 SPEAKER_05 [1:35:37.896 --> 1:35:38.790]: 
  Do they see the...

 SPEAKER_05 [1:35:40.748 --> 1:35:44.899]: 
  I still think that movie is so perfect for so many audiences. I think they didn't understand.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:35:43.499 --> 1:35:44.781]: 
  I think they didn't really understand.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:35:44.494 --> 1:35:55.007]: 
  The high schoolers could not have imagined a movie like that would exist. Kids, that was exactly what it was like a reflection towards. Adults who could not have imagined a movie like that would exist.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:35:55.007 --> 1:36:06.567]: 
  I could kind of see both sides, but it was just such a... It's seriously perfect from every angle. The musical, the writing, the voice acting, the humor, just the dramatic, it just hits every angle. The satire. It's hard to look at it now.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:35:57.893 --> 1:35:58.450]: 
  It's seriously...

 SPEAKER_04 [1:36:00.002 --> 1:36:00.576]:

He takes a rock and the monkey's screaming. It is just beating. It's breathing. They get to pull around and the monkey bellows out louder for help. Monkeys, please help your friend. The man laughs. He chuckles. Horrible. Humanity's real fucked up, John. It's the middle of that story.
