  There is a world as tangible as our own. Impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense. A world enveloped by a seemingly unending ocean of forests. Very deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little cabin.

  former party january 5th 2016 asks how do you guys feel about moccasins would you wear them with or without socks to me to me to me this sounds like this sounds like a dr. suesratt man we should have saved that for the climax of the show what the fuck is this would you wear them here and there would you wear them ever

  I wear mocks without socks.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:49.240 --> 0:01:50.320]: 
  What if the fuck is a mark?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:50.219 --> 0:01:59.229]: 
  The only problem is is that if you wear moccasins without socks they get really sweaty sometimes. Where you get moccasins? At Walmart? No, you get them from like the Birkenstock store.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:59.128 --> 0:02:05.440]:

  Yes, Native Americans, Eskimos, lesbians, and hipsters, and people who like comfy shoes in their house Wear moccasins because they do keep your feet warm. I get cold feet so you would love moccasins. Okay Hey, I'm gonna get you a pair of moccasins. This is a true Christmas. This is a true chrysonial fact This is not a lie or false fabrication. I get cold feet like shit. Liar! I do I do! Why do your feet sweat so much? They don't I get cold feet and they're always really cold. You're a liar That's why I have I have showers twice a day because I want to warm up my feet halfway Yes, it's not a lie. It's probably a circulation thing. I think it is. I think because like you're nine feet tall my feet get really They don't get any blood. What about you Corey? Would you wear moccasins? You would actually love fucking moccasins. I wear socks all the time. Roman around the new grounds office and your fresh pair of shiny moccasins

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:39.366 --> 0:03:47.162]: 
  Under roots is like the children's safe version of boxer shorts for little children. So they're like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:46.572 --> 0:03:50.740]: 
  Why are they children safe? What's so dangerous about normal?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:50.588 --> 0:03:55.937]: 
  They're just for kids. They're under-roos. They're not called... They're not... you can call it boxer shorts. That doesn't sound very kid-like.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:55.904 --> 0:04:30.514]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:35.357 --> 0:04:43.761]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:37.939 --> 0:04:40.403]: 
  Chinese whiteies? Yeah, Chinese whiteies. Oh, whiteies?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:43.761 --> 0:04:56.198]: 
  Hey bittersweet prince January 5th 2016 I'm seeing a very common thing with these user names. If you guys to edit change something in Star Wars movie which movie would it be and what would you do with the movie?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:56.181 --> 0:05:09.749]: 
  I would edit episode one, two, and three. I would highlight the whole thing and press delete. Whoa. So three? No. Three's okay. Three was okay. I think three's the best of the old ones, but it's not really saying much. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:09.006 --> 0:05:34.740]: 
  Yeah, I would change where it was like Jenga Fett was like the number one clone and I would make it So it was actually like practical to like what they did and where they retconned it in the future and made it like you know Just clones of like other troops and stuff and I would do that And if I was to change something I would take what they did in the animated series the samurai jacks Yeah, yeah, and I would force that to be what they do for the real movie And then everyone would fucking love that movie Yeah, and I would say fuck the clonk and fuck this waste of time for the original. Yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:25.628 --> 0:05:26.556]: 
  Да, да, да, да...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:31.180 --> 0:05:31.230]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:34.352 --> 0:05:59.682]: 
  Yeah, I would say the only thing cool that I liked about the first episode was the pod racer the f0 race that they did that That was cool. I just made that the whole movie. I mean that would get old Okay, Eric Kissing asks hello Eric you are now the CEO of Disney What is the first thing you do right? I? Fire everybody at maker studios because they all deserve the fire

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:39.482 --> 0:05:40.107]: 
  Let's see this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:42.064 --> 0:05:43.954]: 
  C'est ok!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:00.407 --> 0:06:47.438]: 
  I closed the fucking call that shit out. You keep me alone. Also, I would be all like, you know the way when 100 years or 50 years passes that stuff becomes like up for grabs? Yeah. They got rid of that. Wait, what do you mean? So now what? So you know like Captain America and stuff? Yeah. Technically that would have been up for anyone to be able to make whatever they wanted with that. Oh, like a movie or? But then they went to the course and they undid all that. So I would undo what they undid. Right. And then everyone could make Captain America a fucking fanfiction and get away with it. Basically if you were the CEO of Disney you'd bring back Captain America. No. You would free Captain America. You would free all of that shit. Free Captain America for a turn. All of that shit. All of them. Yeah, because that's why they still own Mickey Mouse. Mickey Mouse is fucking way up for grabs like years ago, but they changed it. But then they put them in that video game with fucking cloud. I would, I would.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:16.320 --> 0:06:16.675]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:20.404 --> 0:06:21.737]: 
  Oh, like a movie or...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:35.204 --> 0:06:38.393]: 
  I would free all of them.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:47.438 --> 0:06:51.488]: 
  I would free the copyright to Frozen and sell it to the Chinese market.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:53.159 --> 0:07:23.905]: 
  I Go I go in the good old uncle Walt's vault. I'd fucking grab a stack of cash put it in a black Gym bag I go down on the strip I fucking hookers Disney and I get a bunch of blow you're the CEO go back to yeah, that's right I'm the motherfucking CEO. I don't even care. I got the money. I got the money They wouldn't care I go down I'd be like yo hose CEO of Disney and they'd all be like let's get in the car We don't go back to my place and we fuck, you know, that's what

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:55.487 --> 0:06:56.584]: 
  I do.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:08.835 --> 0:07:09.713]: 
  I fucking go

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:23.415 --> 0:07:36.122]: 
  You know, that's what I would do. I think the idea of like Disney being like, yeah, I work for Disney. People look at you like you're like a man child rapist. Like you're like a pedophile. Like they look at you like, we're gonna go back to the Disney world. We're gonna fucking the...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:36.105 --> 0:07:53.099]: 
  You know, it's kind of sad though if you think about it, because like the CEO of Disney isn't even really known for like animation. At this point Disney is such a conglomerate. It owns so many different things. It's just like you're a business guy who owns TV channels and product lines and whatever.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:51.546 --> 0:08:18.900]: 
  Can I say something? It's always bothered me. Like, you know, the faithful characters of Disney, like Mickey Mouse, Donald and Goofy? The only one I even like? Goofy? No, I like Donald. Pluto. Oh yeah, Donald's cool. Donald is the only one I like. I find Mickey to be boring. I find Goofy to be somewhat tolerable, but he still kind of is one personality where he's just a klutz and he's a Goofy idiot. But I like Donald because Donald, like, he gets angry. It's weird that you say that. He has personality.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:59.579 --> 0:07:59.899]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:02.785 --> 0:08:04.472]: 
  Oh, yeah, that was cool

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:17.449 --> 0:08:28.485]: 
  It's weird that you say that because when I was younger I like I didn't care for Mickey mess. I'm older now I don't care for Mickey mess still right when I was younger. I love goofy and I didn't care for Donald Now I'm older and I like Donald and I don't care for goofy

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:28.199 --> 0:08:39.453]: 
  Yeah, it's like I mean I understand goofy and I can see his appeal and he still has personality in the movies Yeah, but Mickey is fucking one cut cookie cutter boring shit. Yeah, he's the poster child for Disney

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:36.332 --> 0:08:36.585]: 
  Please.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:38.830 --> 0:08:45.445]: 
  That's the problem though is that you get like Leonardo syndrome like you just become the bland like good guy Yeah, you know what I mean? And he doesn't

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:44.399 --> 0:08:57.359]: 
  Yeah, and he doesn't do anything. It's like, it's just he's a boring character. Hell, fucking Pluto, his goddamn dog has more personality than he does. Minnie Mouse is also, she might as well just be fucking like, like, me and Batman and Sandpaper.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:54.996 --> 0:09:00.160]: 
  See that's like me and by man a sandfabre Daffy or sorry Donald is like Batman

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:59.940 --> 0:09:26.789]: 
  Yeah, no Minnie Mouse is like Awful Man is Goofy Minnie Mouse is like the embodiment of fucking sandpanper She's useless except for that one job She sucks Mickey's dick and that's all she's good at And Daisy, I think She's got sass Yeah, I like Daisy cause she's sassy and she's also, I think she's hotter than Minnie And that's the thing too, like Donald has such a cool family Like he has a Scrooge McDuck, he has a Huey doing Louie Granny they didn't do so hot on their own but

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:11.314 --> 0:09:12.850]: 
  Jesus got sad.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:27.953 --> 0:09:40.052]: 
  I need to go pee real quick. Is that their name? Louis Dewey and Louis? Yeah, Dewey. I mean, I don't know much about Mickey Mouse aside from what I've learned growing up, but I've always thought Mickey Mouse is just like a very bland character. What do you think it's great? What do you think it's great?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:31.294 --> 0:09:32.087]: 
  Yeah, do we?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:38.820 --> 0:09:42.465]: 
  What do you think it's? What do you think it's angry though? What pushes his butt?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:41.571 --> 0:10:13.448]: 
  Granted though, granted though, and I know I'm probably a crucified for all the stuff I said prior But the new Mickey Mouse how they portray him in the cartoons now. Yeah. Oh, you know what? More animated. Yeah. Oh, I love those. He's got total personality Yeah, you can see like when he's angry. Yeah, see when he's excited. He's a lot more sassy Yeah, and he's got he even if he's a hero he can still like pull some punches I think Mickey now he also gets asked kicked a lot, which is kind of fun Yeah, you see him getting getting F'd with I think Mickey from the 90s was boring 2000s Mickey is much better. That's true. That's my personal opinion

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:49.148 --> 0:09:50.819]: 
  Yeah, oh use the ones on YouTube.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:52.034 --> 0:09:53.384]: 
  Oh, I love this.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:54.345 --> 0:09:55.004]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:55.004 --> 0:09:55.425]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:58.244 --> 0:09:59.070]: 
  He's a lot more sassy.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:02.850 --> 0:10:02.867]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:04.015 --> 0:10:08.706]: 
  He also gets his ass kicked a lot, which is kind of fun. Like you see him getting effed with.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:12.300 --> 0:10:12.317]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:13.448 --> 0:10:21.059]: 
  Yeah, the new, I think the new Mickey, if he was to look back at the old Mickey, he'd be like, who's this fucking Melvin? Yeah, yeah. If he was back in time, he'd just kick that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:18.662 --> 0:10:25.632]: 
  Yeah. But in the same way, it's like loony tunes. Like, I like the old loony tunes. Like, I like how the old ones. But see, that's the opposite.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:24.788 --> 0:10:40.110]: 
  But see, that's the opposite then because I feel like, yeah, the old Looney Tunes had more sass and the newer ones are like these weird washed out heredies of like the old characters while I think the new Mickey is definitely, I think, more up to par with what's going on.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:29.429 --> 0:10:29.580]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:39.368 --> 0:10:42.962]: 
  Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, definitely he's hip. Yeah, he's cool uses Bitcoin

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:41.933 --> 0:10:48.582]: 
  He uses Bitcoin. He rides a hoverboard, which isn't really a hoverboard. It's that stupid fucking skateboard hoverboard.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:46.962 --> 0:10:47.114]: 
  Thanks.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:48.075 --> 0:10:52.345]: 
  He goes on the dark web to snuff private sites and he watches people get axed.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:49.932 --> 0:10:50.455]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:53.931 --> 0:11:00.394]: 
  Oh boy, they saved me a seat! Oh no! Cut her a little bit!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:01.255 --> 0:11:11.194]: 
  Yeah, let me see it, please! Okay, that's enough. It's just creepy. Bicky would not do that with his bitcoins. He would spend them on drugs and weed. Yes. He'd be blazing, not fucking watching snuff.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:06.520 --> 0:11:06.537]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:11.144 --> 0:11:17.438]: 
  Duh, it would be on YouTube looking at, like, ducks, rape, dead ducks. And he'd be like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:17.438 --> 0:11:20.492]: 
  I came back at the right time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:20.492 --> 0:11:35.241]: 
  That's Donald Duck drinking. Oh, so... He's like... He's duck like fuck the duck duck. We're talking about if like Mickey was really a freak behind closed doors. He's not this vanilla family. He's already a freak.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:34.330 --> 0:11:53.635]: 
  He's already a freak because Mini is like identical to Mickey except that you know It's eyelashes and a bow on top of its head. Here's a game. He's like fucking yourself Wait, wait, this is important wait. Okay. Wait Mickey's dick. How did Walt Disney draw? Like a pig dick. Is it black like that's what I'm saying. Yes. Is it all black is it all pink?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:41.637 --> 0:11:43.712]: 
  He's like fucking himself essentially.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:43.712 --> 0:11:43.729]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:50.007 --> 0:11:51.120]: 
  Like, that's what I'm saying.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:53.567 --> 0:11:57.128]: 
  But here's the game theory. Have you ever seen Mickey and Minnie in the same room?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:57.955 --> 0:12:40.935]: 
  Yes. Many times. Fucking fight club. Hahaha. I don't know. Can you imagine that? He's like, Oh boy, hey guys I'll be right back. I just gotta check on the fucking meatloaf. And he just turns around and he like just slaps a bow on his head. That's literally all she does back out. She just like flutters her eyelashes and wears a dress and a bow. Yeah, it's actually him. She's everything. Yeah, I bet if you really pay attention to the character. When there was that episode, when there was that episode of the Disney's Like the awesome Disney Disney's

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:14.982 --> 0:12:16.281]: 
  Really all she is back at.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:20.584 --> 0:12:24.094]: 
  everything. See, when Minnie, when there was that episode...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:40.935 --> 0:12:46.335]: 
  He fooled the audience. He held up a mirror with his inflection.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:46.335 --> 0:12:55.752]: 
  When Mickey goes up for like, you know, when he's finally released from Disney as like, you can do what you want with him Yeah, that's gonna be one of the first things that people do. I'm sure there's gonna be so much porn

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:53.828 --> 0:13:08.931]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:11.344 --> 0:13:11.631]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:12.441 --> 0:13:26.447]: 
  If you use anything to like if you were to make a parody and you use like actual characters and it's like a parody But it's using the characters you could still get in trouble for that So it has to be parodies of the characters So if you're doing Captain America you need to be like Captain United States or some shit. Yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:17.942 --> 0:13:18.162]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:25.975 --> 0:13:31.122]: 
  Yeah, but most people don't really do that anyways. No. They're not really gonna crack down on you for doing it priority.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:30.919 --> 0:13:39.053]: 
  Nobody really wants to do a parody of fucking Disney stuff because it's just kind of what are you gonna make a parody of like big hero 6? Good luck with that. I bet a whole four people will see it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:40.251 --> 0:14:17.950]: 
  Well, they're fucking up DVD heroes sex. Alright, here we go. I got a question for y'all you guys ready? Yeah, Matt cat Jan asks Any cast member what kind of character would you make in Dungeons & Dragons? What character? Yeah, what I make yeah me Yeah, me with a sword me too you with a sword and big sandals I would make Chris with the sword as my character. I'd make a trappy I'd make him run around into an ogre's den and just bend over and open his butt Listen, not do that. I would never go into an ogre's den and do that. A whole lord of the rings orc army would just rip your butt I would make... That's not fair

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:08.129 --> 0:14:08.517]: 
  alright

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:08.517 --> 0:14:11.250]: 
  Not do that

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:10.744 --> 0:14:11.976]: 
  I could never go into an argument.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:16.802 --> 0:14:23.198]: 
  I would make a trappy rogue slut. That's what I would do. That's my Dungeons and Dragons character.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:23.114 --> 0:14:26.792]: 
  Nice. So you'd be able to seduce people, but then you could also fucking them up.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:26.742 --> 0:14:41.828]: 
  No, they would fuck me and I would get extra points. I would get criticals every time they fuck me. And I would win. I'd get to the Dungeon Master and two fucks. To me Dungeons & Dragons is you throw a dice down and it's like you just got frozen. Yeah, I don't understand it. Dude, I'm sure it's rolled a dice.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:39.162 --> 0:14:51.075]: 
  I don't understand. Dude, you roll the dice, you move your character, you buy boardwalk in park place, and then you put hotels on it, and then if you tip it over the pieces, you get a Jenga and you lose it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:44.123 --> 0:14:45.861]: 
  It's a little more, you know, that's...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:50.654 --> 0:14:51.767]: 
  That's getting in trouble.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:51.767 --> 0:14:52.510]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:52.510 --> 0:14:56.830]: 
  Getting in trouble, what are your kids doing? Getting in trouble!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:58.686 --> 0:15:01.437]: 
  Alright so the answer is basically fucked up

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:58.703 --> 0:15:02.449]: 
  Alright so the answer is basically fuck them, Juss and Dragons.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:01.437 --> 0:15:11.005]: 
  I mean no no I would younger I did play I would like to play Dungeons & Dragons But I would play to the key of how my brain works. I'll just say this

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:03.614 --> 0:15:05.689]: 
  When I was younger, I did play it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:11.005 --> 0:15:27.374]: 
  This is a true fact. I'm not kidding. 100% I know you guys think I'm joking. I can see it, but I'm being honest, okay? Every time I made a character without doubt and I maybe made like 20 characters over the course of my life They were always dwarves.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:13.350 --> 0:15:13.452]: 
  Thank you all.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:13.452 --> 0:15:15.004]: 
  I'm not kidding.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:27.374 --> 0:15:31.137]: 
  Yeah, that's because they're mini and they can fit through the holes whenever you get to like those cracks in the wall

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:31.137 --> 0:15:32.622]: 
  That never happened with my character.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:33.027 --> 0:15:34.242]: 
  You weren't playing the way I played.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:37.566 --> 0:16:11.451]: 
  There's a crack in a wall and you're a dwarf you're like hold on I got this Fucking start shoving your face into the crack roll. No roll the dice You get through the whole oh by the way. I'm a liquid the warp. Oh, okay cool No, I mean Cory you suck at dungeon and dragon They'd be like you can roll the dice, but you got a roll of seven on this dice Orbs, you're like I'm gonna do it anyway Worves aren't just like little pinned like my no I fit through anything with the crack about paper Mario not

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:52.298 --> 0:15:52.703]: 
  Okay, cool.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:02.507 --> 0:16:04.600]: 
  You're like, I'm gonna do it anyway.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:06.962 --> 0:16:07.452]: 
  No, I mean

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:11.451 --> 0:16:26.234]: 
  With the crack I was thinking like small passageways. Yes. Yes, like like yes. Yeah, like a crack like like They can go through a doggy door to open up the main door

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:15.315 --> 0:16:16.109]: 
  Yes. Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:25.829 --> 0:16:28.596]: 
  That would be very demeaning though for a dwarf

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:28.562 --> 0:16:31.279]: 
  Well they don't play as small person in a Dungeons & Dragons game.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:31.279 --> 0:16:43.733]: 
  I'd be an orc so I could stand in front of a green screen and go invisible. You'd be an orc so you could fuck my Chris character in the butt. I would not! My Chris character. I don't even know. Easily defeated the war. I don't understand anything about...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:42.636 --> 0:16:45.589]: 
  I don't understand anything about dragons and dragons.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:44.594 --> 0:16:51.462]: 
  I'm never playing. I do want to play it though. I would like to play it someday. Next up we got Colton Cheviz. You've never played Othello?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:51.293 --> 0:16:51.411]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:53.858 --> 0:16:55.410]: 
  This is a hard game.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:59.579 --> 0:17:34.375]: 
  I love this question, you guys ready? Can we expect to see any cartoons or sleepy cabin skits anytime soon? If so, estimated time of release, Chris go. We will never estimate a time of release for any project. Because it will always be way more than we actually say. Estimated time of release. If so, estimated time of release. We will never be on time, but also you can expect shit, but we're all still working on our own stuff. We're all hitting a point in our careers where the internet is fucking us so we have to get her fucking in the door for other places.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:00.051 --> 0:17:00.743]: 
  Where is it?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:02.633 --> 0:17:03.510]: 
  Can we expect this?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:13.787 --> 0:17:15.998]: 
  Because it will always be

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:34.206 --> 0:17:44.652]: 
  Yeah, I don't really see the focus of the internet for me currently. I mean, I use it as a means to socialize and still interact with people, but I don't see myself dedicating tons of hours into doing stuff for this game's potential.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:44.618 --> 0:17:50.204]: 
  I think this is this so far is the most consistent way for us to connect with people.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:47.588 --> 0:17:53.174]: 
  Yeah, because we're just talking. And this is like the easiest thing to do is it's nice to get together and talk.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:52.110 --> 0:18:35.952]: 
  You know, the more you think about it, and this isn't just a justification for us lowering the the patreon thing down to a dollar I honestly believe that like it's so like let's say people want to support sleepy Kevin, right? So this is one of the things we do But when you support sleepy Kevin you're supporting all the guys in it and we all happen to be doing different things than when we started Right, we're not making a lot of the cartoons that we were making for YouTube and whatnot Yeah, but instead you're making cartoons for television or the series. I'm trying to pitch stuff as well There's the video game that pretty much all of us are working on right now Yeah, you know so I feel like to a degree the only difference the only difference is that a lot of the stuff isn't on YouTube That's literally the only difference That's really what it was still making so many things like either it's music or games or or videos, but just not on YouTube

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:02.235 --> 0:18:02.910]: 
  So this is one of the...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:21.675 --> 0:18:21.945]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:21.945 --> 0:18:22.030]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:30.147 --> 0:18:31.159]: 
  That's really what it was still made for.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:35.952 --> 0:18:56.320]: 
  You pretty much have to make your YouTube quota if you still want to stay relevant I suppose outside of like a podcast because it's like you know if you don't release something for it even then so like the system Has been is so fucked up. No if I was to release something I've completely been absolutely bled it's there's so much blood that's gone that there's nothing to bleed anymore It's fine. I'm just curious

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:47.494 --> 0:18:48.102]: 
  If I was to

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:56.016 --> 0:19:04.082]: 
  Like we were talking we're talking about like with the algorithm like if you don't put out stuff or if people haven't seen your stuff And you don't even show up like in the feed

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:01.163 --> 0:19:05.500]: 
  You don't even show up like in the feed. Yeah, that's what I'm saying you get subscribed so like get

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:04.842 --> 0:19:09.145]: 
  So like if you spent like two months on a video

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:08.014 --> 0:19:10.866]: 
  They would only get like 10,000 views maybe.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:10.866 --> 0:19:12.756]: 
  Like, no one even fucking see it. Yeah. It was like,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:12.570 --> 0:19:14.039]: 
  It's just a waste of time.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:14.039 --> 0:19:14.933]: 
  Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:14.916 --> 0:19:19.135]: 
  It's specifically catered to the Let's Play community and the vloggers. They can release stuff out regularly.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:19.101 --> 0:19:44.262]: 
  That said, Chris and I were already talking about some stuff. I'm not putting out any release dates, but we got the cameras and we do want to start filming some stuff. So it's always something that's on our mind. It's always something we want to do when we hang out. That's one of the first things we talk about is like, hey, we should do this or we really want to do that. So it is on our list and currently it's on our schedule. So we'll see how it goes. We'll see how it goes. Okay, this is a good one. It's from Jay Mac.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:44.464 --> 0:19:48.447]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:25.079 --> 0:24:34.292]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:15.531 --> 0:29:22.855]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:25.842 --> 0:29:35.967]: 
  It's like it's I think it's really like I've seen one or two years ago No, it's just this really charming curtain because it feels like I'm adults or a swim kind of like thing and it does

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:28.677 --> 0:29:29.807]:

  Oh yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:44.505 --> 0:29:45.383]: 
  Yeah, that's the one.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:50.344 --> 0:29:52.859]: 
  We gotta make read some questions

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:52.808 --> 0:30:10.949]: 
  Wingman 2699 asks, Outlook on life? Oh man, I'm gonna kill myself. What? The end is nigh. What is the outlook, man? What's kind of like what you imagine the end of, the conclusion that you give to life? What's your outlook? What do you perceive the future? What is your opinion of life? Yeah. For me,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:07.337 --> 0:30:46.032]: 
  What is your opinion of life? Yeah. For me, I want to go out with a bang. I think most people want to do that. But even if, like, you know, death is inevitable, I'd still really like to have something to my name that I could look back on for generations. And, like, you know how, like, even if Grant Kirkhope was to, like, keel over, he still has, like, the Band of Kazooie soundtrack and all the rare stuff he's done in Band of Kazooie. Like, it was like a big... Everyone will always remember that because it had such a huge impact on people. And I'd like that to have that much of an impact that could last for, like, years and shit. That's a really nice way of putting it. That's personally what I think life is. Life is a goal you have to infinitely reach and it's, like, you know, they throw a bunch of curveballs. When I heard that,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:12.670 --> 0:30:12.957]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:35.029 --> 0:30:35.384]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:37.780 --> 0:30:37.814]: 
  MBC 뉴스 이덕영입니다.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:45.610 --> 0:32:08.939]: 
  When I heard that question, that wasn't what I was thinking at all though. I thought he was more so asking like, what do you think of life so far? Is that what he was saying? So what's your outlook on life? I hate it. Sorry. You said you had a long answer. Yeah, I do. Okay, this is my long answer, right? When I was in school from the age of about 12 through 18, all I wanted was to get out of school and do animation, right? And all the way through school, I was like, this is so fucking pointless. All I want to do is make stuff. And now that I'm at the point where I'm just making stuff, I'm just like, I'm not content yet. I need to figure out what I really want to do in the long term because it looks like for now, animation does not actually make me happy. It's not rewarding to me. And it's one of those things that's always going to be like, people will take advantage of you and not appreciate it. And it's cool as a hobby. I love it as a hobby, right? But now that's my job and all this pressure, it's like, I don't want to do this as a job anymore. So I'm trying to figure out what I want to do. Yeah, this is one other thing is that when you're in school, you're like, I want to get out. You don't realize how fucking hard the real world is. Yeah. I'm figuring this out every week. Every fucking week there's something new that I have to figure out that I did not know I'd have to do. Like fucking washing machine breaks. You're like, what the fuck do I do now? I'll call the guy in the back. Oh, it's another $200 gone. It's like, cool. So every fucking week something goes wrong and you will have to have a shit ton of money saved. Reality hits you like a brick. Yeah. It's you fucking leave mom alone.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:25.047 --> 0:31:25.350]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:08.939 --> 0:32:11.909]: 
  me and daddy's crib. Yeah, you get you get a wake up call.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:11.554 --> 0:32:14.541]: 
  There is so, so much shit you gotta do when you leave.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:14.372 --> 0:32:50.451]: 
  That's something I wanted to talk about though. I had a discussion with someone on the sub right was talking about high school Where it's like people say high school is some of the best years of their life. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope I'm gonna go into that but it's like for me. This is what I remember from high school I remember immediately getting out of high school. They told me to go to college Yeah, and then they they were like they were like you need to go to college decide which one to do in life But when I was in high school, they're like you need to go high school decide what you want to do in life Yeah, so it's like where's the off switch? Where do you decide where you want to do in life? And it's like when I see high school a guy brought up some points It's like it teaches you basic like social skills, but I personally think you should have been learning these kinds of social schools And your grade school. Yeah, like if you can't fucking shit

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:50.451 --> 0:32:54.737]: 
  share or I'll tell me how to hide smoking yeah sheet on taxes

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:53.016 --> 0:33:30.900]: 
  Yeah Like people both important lessons. No, no, no. Yeah, like what's what's funny to me is for me in high school I can it was like the breaking point like when you were in middle school You didn't get into drugs your friends were getting into all this shit when you get into high school It's that breaking point where you either get to a point where you just want to drop out or you finish it But you don't even care and you don't retain any of that knowledge Yeah, and that's what it's like for a lot of people like they're just getting through high school They're just getting by they're cheating or doing whatever the fuck they can to get that passing grade and then they're done They're not gonna retain any knowledge and they're just gonna know that oh I have a golden ticket for when I go to like a job that I may get picked for it

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:55.986 --> 0:32:56.222]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:58.197 --> 0:33:00.374]: 
  Yeah, like what's what's funny?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:16.034 --> 0:33:16.337]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:30.749 --> 0:33:54.255]: 
  I think something everyone should do is take a year out after high school. Oh, definitely. Because everyone rushes into college and then most people I know drop out and then they're in debt. Yeah. Most people I know get a degree that they don't even fucking want. By the time they get their degree, they don't even want a job in the thing that they studied. What a waste of four years and however much debt they're gonna have to work themselves out. Luckily in Ireland, you don't get that for college at all.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:34.073 --> 0:33:35.069]: 
  Oh, definitely.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:40.131 --> 0:33:41.700]: 
  Yeah. Most people I know get it. It's like.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:51.269 --> 0:33:52.146]: 
  in Ireland

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:53.699 --> 0:34:07.452]: 
  Yeah, but it's like with high school. It's like, oh, you know people consider you stupid if you don't graduate high school You could retain way more knowledge after high school if you really actively went out of it How all high school did was just give you a bunch of bullshit extra curricials. You didn't have to do

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:58.997 --> 0:33:59.402]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:07.452 --> 0:34:15.534]: 
  Usually if you're like super talented at something you'll find a job with it People aren't going to turn you away because you didn't get your degree if they can see that you can make them a lot of money They're gonna hire you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:10.185 --> 0:34:10.556]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:15.484 --> 0:34:51.310]: 
  Yeah, I wanted to do art and I was doing like science like social studies and all this shit And it's like I clearly didn't want to be like a social studies teacher or a science teacher So, you know, I didn't want to do that. So when I was doing high school, I wasn't like, you know, I want to be a teacher I want to be actively going after I was just like, oh god, I have fucking science I have to finish and get an A so I can just have a degree and to me It's like when people say like, oh like you need a high school diploma You don't really because honestly like what it comes down to is yes It's probably good to like but you're not gonna go into a job and be like got your high school diploma Where can I sign like what can I get started?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:50.483 --> 0:36:10.184]: 
  I think what's kind of hard though is that that frame of mind that kind of thinking comes from a generation Before the internet was as popular as it was and I think that that kind of thinking just kind of kind of got passed down the line So that's what they would teach you and then that's just what you expect the thing is though I honestly believe that before the internet became as easily accessible as it is Before it became so easy for anyone just to do like a square space or a YouTube where you can post your content or a sound cloud Where you can post your content. Yeah, I mean it isn't just for the creatives There's plenty of ways of showing your work now and what you do But I think back in the day they had to have these very like by the numbers ways of Basically sifting through the cattle because they didn't have all this access that's what you know, you say like oh Why don't they just they're not gonna hire you you know just because of your degree like they'll look at your work But the thing is is that back then they needed to sift through Thousands of applications. Well the first thing they're gonna do this is before they could just go online and look at your shit You know they'd have to go they just look at the schools you go to yeah, so for them back then I kind of get it I kind of understand why but now there's no excuse now There's just so many ways of showcasing what you do so easily that yeah, it doesn't matter what fucking school you go to it Doesn't yeah, what you bring to the table is what really matters

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:35.995 --> 0:35:37.986]: 
  That's what Chris, you know, you say like, oh.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:09.829 --> 0:36:38.871]: 
  Like people are saying like oh the best years of my life is like high school And it's like what do you remember from high school? You may remember a few cool teachers maybe you may remember a few like fucking people you fucked or had girlfriend I fucked a lot. Yeah, you may remember that. And I drank. But what you don't remember is you don't remember those fun math problems and any of that shit So it's like you don't remember this stuff because you only remember the good times You know what I think? See equivalent of remembering a party that you had got really drunk and threw up all over yourself. I think the people

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:23.009 --> 0:36:25.827]: 
  Yeah, you may remember that. And I drink. But what you don't...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:37.589 --> 0:36:49.300]: 
  I think the people who say that are the people in high school who are the top of the popularity chain And then they come out and they're nothing and they waste all their time doing shit But even then so I don't know

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:42.651 --> 0:36:44.305]: 
  and then they come out.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:45.030 --> 0:36:45.773]: 
  and then we stop.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:47.174 --> 0:36:52.574]: 
  But even then so, all you remember though is socializing with your friends and like drinking and being in a house.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:51.089 --> 0:36:51.426]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:52.152 --> 0:37:04.285]: 
  Yeah, but that's better for a lot of people than whatever miserable life they have now where they're fucking Yeah dealing with a washing machine every week and paying this bill and dealing with this medical thing and dealing with that debt or whatever the fun

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:56.657 --> 0:36:56.910]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:03.863 --> 0:37:15.321]: 
  So what it comes to in my opinion is this like high school is one of those things where that's what I said To me high school was a make-or-break situation either make it or you just break it. There's there's no middle ground You either make it through how you break it

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:14.292 --> 0:37:19.810]: 
  How you break it how you break it Corey you break high school you quit break

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:18.510 --> 0:37:33.782]: 
  It's just a term. I always consider high school make it or break it. Luckily weed wasn't popular when I was in high school, so I was able to get through high school But I guarantee if weed had been two or three more years whenever weed started getting really popular. Oh, it's been popular, but it's been popular.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:32.348 --> 0:37:35.504]: 
  Oh, it's been popular, but it depends on the area sometimes it's no

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:35.301 --> 0:37:59.939]: 
  No, in our area, it's criminalized, so people can't smoke weed. So nobody smoked weed until like everyone was finished with high school and then everyone started smoking weed. But during that time, we were all just doing high school. And it's different for everybody, but really what it comes down to is you're only gonna remember the socializing experiences you had in high school. You're not gonna remember the fucking- you're not gonna remember your math problems, you're not gonna show off your work too, you're not gonna be like, look, I got an A-plus on my English exam, they're gonna be like, cool, I don't care.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:59.922 --> 0:39:27.638]: 
  As far as my outlook on life, I have a very positive one at least. I love life despite the shittiness that's happened. I feel very lucky, very fortunate to have the friends and the opportunities that I've had. I feel like I've done a lot more of the things that I've wanted to do than a lot of people may in their life. Yeah. If I found out I got a terrible disease tomorrow, I don't think I could be very hangry. I mean, I'm young, I'd be sad. I'd be obviously upset that I didn't get to do everything I wanted to do, because there's still a lot I want to do, but I do feel like I can't really complain. When you say that, I feel really bad, because that's how I should feel, but I just don't. You've grown with it your whole life. I think when you get older, it's easier to appreciate those things. It's like what me and you were saying earlier is like, when we were walking into the new, like we're recording this at Newgrounds right now. We were talking about the idea that like, here we are at Newgrounds recording a podcast. Just saying those words, right? Like, it's not a big deal to us, because we do it like all the time. Like, you know, you basically live here. Like, Cory, when me and you were like 16, can you imagine saying that to yourself and being like, no? I couldn't imagine it. I was in a room with you. Yeah, and it's not like there's like fucking big bitched hose and shit bouncing around and like fucking champagne pouring out of the fridge. It's, you know, it's what it is, but it's still not a life that I would have ever have expected and it's a really cool one. You know, it's hard work and it, you know, it drives you crazy at times,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:20.340 --> 0:38:20.880]: 
  in your life.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:40.742 --> 0:38:41.940]: 
  I think when you get older it's...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:01.077 --> 0:39:02.207]: 
  live here.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:06.240 --> 0:39:09.075]: 
  I couldn't imagine it if it was in a room with you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:27.216 --> 0:39:39.535]: 
  It's interesting how things like turn into this way. Yeah. Can I say something though? Because I really like this question. Do it. Turbo Cancer asks, could you use a movie title to describe the last shit you took? I like that. I like that idea.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:30.034 --> 0:39:30.389]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:39.518 --> 0:39:49.913]: 
  Jackie Brown. Jackie Brown? Yeah, but wait, wait, wait. Is it checked off? No, but is the title supposed to be reminiscent of like the actual, like the actual movie? You know what I mean?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:44.496 --> 0:39:45.087]: 
  It's supposed to be remedy.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:47.129 --> 0:39:47.955]: 
  Like it's like the-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:49.120 --> 0:39:53.676]: 
  I just took a rumble in the Bronx

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:53.642 --> 0:40:02.940]: 
  See, I would actually try to equate the actual plot of the movie to the plot of my shit. It's impossible! No! Today's shit that I took.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:58.772 --> 0:40:00.865]: 
  Jacky, Jacky, it's impossible! No!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:02.940 --> 0:40:07.227]: 
  movie titles. So I took a fucking rubble in the brock. I like that. I like that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:06.974 --> 0:40:28.439]: 
  What did you do? Okay, so think of a movie that fits this description. Yeah, I had a wiki-jack and no it was it was highly There was a lot of hype. There was a lot of anticipation. I was so excited Yeah, I sat down a little bit came out then all of a sudden I got a big boost It was great, but then I was kind of expecting something to happen at the end Yeah, then I was just kind of pinching off little nuggets little little like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:10.855 --> 0:40:11.513]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:11.125 --> 0:40:11.361]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:28.439 --> 0:40:34.007]: 
  And the smell of your shake kept reminding you of a prior shit that you had that you really enjoyed.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:34.007 --> 0:41:00.501]: 
  enjoyed yeah so what movie does that with Star Wars actually that are that of the Martian no no no the Martian actually has at least a climax I'm gonna explain my shit with the plot of a movie okay so I was taking a shit and the the camera pants through the toilet and there's like this machine that's like creating breakfast and then it's slops down and then this little shit came out of my ass it came in the view it's like beginning of back to the future

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:38.547 --> 0:40:40.791]: 
  You said it again!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:43.980 --> 0:40:44.807]: 
  at least a client now.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:00.501 --> 0:41:04.500]: 
  I was thinking, I was thinking it was cute. You remember that fucking, you remember that?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:03.488 --> 0:41:08.196]: 
  You remember that back in the future? Yeah when the machine drops talking about okay?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:06.846 --> 0:41:10.491]: 
  What are you talking about? I was thinking it was Peewee Herman's big adventure.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:10.491 --> 0:41:36.040]: 
  A lot of movies start with that machine that makes breakfast. Uh, Ben Meyers asks, How do you guys deal with stress? What are things that you use as a getaway from life? I like taking baths. I like sitting in my beanbag and pondering. Do you really? What do you ponder? I don't know. You're a liar. You can sit on your fucking iPhone and play little fake songs on your phone. It's not a lie. You can stare at the ceiling and ponder? Sometimes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:23.974 --> 0:41:24.177]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:28.632 --> 0:41:29.796]: 
  You're a liar.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:30.775 --> 0:41:32.901]: 
  Play little fake songs on your phone.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:36.040 --> 0:41:48.122]: 
  That's what I like to do. That's very introspective of me. It's like, you have bats to... When I relax, I like to sit, lay comfortably in an area, and place my little iPad up on my stomach and watch shows on my stomach.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:48.122 --> 0:42:18.936]: 
  You know what? I'm a very introverted person. I like being around people, but I don't like talking to people all the time. Introverted. Is that when your penis goes inside your body? Nothing's about a penis. It's when... Okay, so there's introverts and extroverts. Uh, extroverts get energy from people talking to them and being around them. Extroverts. Introverts get their energy sucked out of them by other people. So, let's say if I'm at a party, right? Yeah. I'll walk in the door and instantly I'll be getting tired from all the fucking commotion. And then after an hour I'll want to leave because I'm like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:54.113 --> 0:41:54.974]: 
  in absolve

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:56.594 --> 0:41:58.450]: 
  Your body? Nothing's about a penis.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:18.936 --> 0:42:23.324]: 
  So Chris, I'm in the exact same way. Yeah, well, that's introverted.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:20.995 --> 0:42:32.318]: 
  Yeah, well that's introvert and extrovert. You know, I'm a complete introvert. I like being around people occasionally, but most of the time I like just sitting in a corner and watching TV or something. It depends on the group.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:30.597 --> 0:42:38.275]: 
  It depends on the group. If there's like maybe like two or three people I can manage But if there's like more than fucking like 10. Yeah, yeah, I don't want to be there

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:36.368 --> 0:42:40.620]: 
  Yeah, yeah, me too. I don't want to be there. Then what is Goku? He's a uh...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:40.148 --> 0:42:42.139]: 
  Goku's a hero for all mankind.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:41.684 --> 0:43:45.977]: 
  Cuz clearly he gets energy from everybody. I am I don't know what I mean I like to play I like to stream like I'll play blood board or Dark Souls which a lot of people are like Why are you doing this to relax? But I actually find it very relaxing playing games and I also like to do it on stream I like to have like a group of people like really good point I don't know if being an introvert or an extrovert would like what streaming effect you in either way right because I Actually personally feel that I get a lot of my energy sucked out of me while I'm streaming So I usually only do for an hour or so well that could also be part of the introvert then Yeah, probably but see that's weird because stamper I don't know if he's an introvert or an extrovert because I think he's an extrovert because he likes people he does But sometimes he obviously likes to be left alone. Yeah, but then he'll like yeah Well, I also think everything is never black and white. Yeah, like I'm just saying for him I feel like he's just extremes like sometimes he's like I'm not talking to people for a week And then other times he's like, you know like hey He's the host of the house and or he'll stream for like eight hours and talk to everybody, you know like yeah I don't think he's black or white. I think he's like his own dude. Yeah, but as for me and Corey like we're introverts to the

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:56.061 --> 0:42:57.175]: 
  I actually have like a group of people

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:56.095 --> 0:42:57.799]: 
  I actually have like a group of people like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:23.348 --> 0:43:24.850]: 
  Yeah, but some...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:27.719 --> 0:43:28.242]: 
  I'm just saying...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:45.505 --> 0:43:52.170]: 
  I'm the exact same as you Chris. I'm pretty sure like I don't like being around a lot of people unless I'm drinking Yeah, and I'll try and drink myself even if I

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:50.500 --> 0:43:50.753]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:51.698 --> 0:43:54.904]: 
  Even if I'm drinking though, like after an hour I'll be like, oh, I want to go.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:54.904 --> 0:44:06.379]: 
  back into my room. Me too, but I'll get as drunk as possible so I get tired and then everything like if I'm still awake somehow and it's weird because sometimes I'll still manage to stay awake even when I'm drunk. Yeah. I'll work through my drinking. That's not the same.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:04.034 --> 0:44:04.624]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:05.620 --> 0:44:23.828]: 
  That's not the same though that I'm not friendly or whatever like I do like being around people You'll cower away from people when they try to shake your hand I don't know it's just something that no like I'm out going I'll shake people's hands and I'll like I'll hug people and be cool and stuff, but after like an hour or two. I'll just be like so out of energy I'll just have to leave just

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:08.438 --> 0:44:09.299]: 
  Oh, no.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:10.969 --> 0:44:13.349]: 
  cow or away from people when they try to shake your hand.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:23.642 --> 0:44:27.287]: 
  Jeff's the same way, he doesn't like being around people for too long, he has to have his alone time.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:27.287 --> 0:44:28.620]: 
  Yeah, no, I love alone time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:28.553 --> 0:44:35.860]: 
  I need a long time. That's why I kind of like just laying down and like watching something by myself Yeah, then I fall asleep and I wake up from a power nap and I'm ready to work again

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:32.367 --> 0:44:33.126]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:35.860 --> 0:45:06.674]: 
  Okay, Father O'Crypha? Okay, well he asks, How does each member of the podcast approach learning something new when they're in a mood that essentially works against their will to do so? How do you guys push to learn even when you're in the midst of a mental block or emotional fun? Sorry, say that whole thing one more time from the beginning. Okay, in baby retard mode for Mick. Yes, please. It's if um, how do you how do you push yourself to learn something when you're not feeling like learning something? Oh, okay. But basically I think that doesn't make sense because

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:57.392 --> 0:44:57.899]: 
  Please.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:06.623 --> 0:45:10.825]: 
  I want to learn something if I don't want to.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:08.918 --> 0:45:54.244]: 
  Yeah, you don't learn something if you don't want to learn something, but like I don't I think human nature is wanting to learn something that you're interested in Yeah, well, I'll tell you this I have learned plenty of things when I wouldn't necessarily want to and that's when I've a deadlock Yeah, but but he's asking like how do you learn something when you don't want to learn or like when you're in a You know, right a mental block, but I don't know I always like if I want to learn something I want to learn something Yeah, usually right if you have a mental block then you feel like you don't learn Yeah, like you could sit there and stare at a tutorial for 18 hours on repeat But if you're not in the mind frame to learn it's just gonna pass right maybe you don't want to do it at all Right, maybe you should learn something you do want to learn. That's a good Suggestion maybe it's a bad suggestion if he needs to learn

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:15.550 --> 0:45:16.225]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:44.322 --> 0:45:44.828]: 
  You don't want to

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:48.760 --> 0:45:49.047]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:56.505 --> 0:46:00.707]: 
  The only way you'll want to learn something is if you challenge yourself. That's the only way

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:00.370 --> 0:46:12.081]: 
  Yeah, it's like for instance like anatomy like if you want to learn how to draw people correctly Then you're gonna need to learn anatomy you're gonna learn it you got to learn it You gotta level up. You just get level up. You gotta level up

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:06.799 --> 0:46:07.474]: 
  You're gonna learn it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:08.082 --> 0:46:34.137]: 
  You gotta level up. You gotta level up, bitch. Stop crying like a little baby. If you don't want to learn it, then the only way you're going to learn it is to just sit down and do it over and over and over until it's in your brain. Stop complaining and grow a pair of legs. So you can run. My advice is if you don't want to learn it, then just write it down or draw it over and over and over and over until it's in your brain. Or learn something you do want to learn.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:12.081 --> 0:46:13.920]: 
  Stop crying like a little baby.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:22.797 --> 0:46:24.501]: 
  Okay, so legs. I guess my...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:24.501 --> 0:46:24.822]: 
  You can.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:25.429 --> 0:46:25.446]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:33.749 --> 0:46:49.577]: 
  Find alternative ways to do it that makes you want to do it, which sounds insane. It doesn't really sound like it's plausible. It's like, if I want to learn Chinese, or if I want to learn Japanese, I'm not just going to watch Animais all day and try to go pause it. Like they say, where'd I be like? Ha, wa, wa, wa, tisii nii ah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:36.027 --> 0:46:36.347]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:49.577 --> 0:46:53.104]: 
  That's not a fucking thing. Yes it is. Is it? It's Chinese. Nope!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:54.522 --> 0:46:57.525]: 
  What? Hathi wathi? Tulsi bo po po po? Oh my

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:57.104 --> 0:46:58.943]: 
  Oh my god!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:58.943 --> 0:47:02.993]: 
  First of all, that's Japanese.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:02.993 --> 0:47:11.734]: 
  Nick Sheldman asks, yes, an alien invasion is happening tomorrow and you have no time to prepare for the onslaught. What's your game plan?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:11.734 --> 0:47:13.725]: 
  Well, I know the aliens are coming to the world.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:12.544 --> 0:47:16.780]: 
  Wait, I have no time to plan. You've got no time to plan, but what are you gonna do right now?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:16.695 --> 0:47:19.058]: 
  with the aliens. I know the aliens are coming tomorrow.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:19.024 --> 0:47:20.155]:

  No, what did I say?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:32.676 --> 0:47:38.481]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:34.532 --> 0:47:34.802]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:38.481 --> 0:47:47.003]:
