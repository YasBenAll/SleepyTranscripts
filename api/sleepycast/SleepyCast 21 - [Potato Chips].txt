Anyone born after it, anyone born in 1990 or later? It's a 2000 thing. You wouldn't get it. Yeah, exactly. If you were born in the 80s, you don't even know what the fucking shit and you wouldn't do it because guess what? When you have a problem with someone, you fucking walk right up to them, you look them dead in the eye and you fucking say your problem. You don't create some alternate account using some fake ass information so you can sit behind a little shield and throw potatoes at people. Here's my Nile account on the side. You're a faggot. I got you. And then I pay my power bill. Yeah, and then you go home and you think about how awesome you burn somebody with a name they never even heard of.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:07.185 --> 0:03:11.084]: 
  And you know some French people are actually quite religious. Did you know that, snapper?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:11.084 --> 0:03:20.449]: 
  I did, but I thought the Irish... What the world was religious? The world is... You know, for the... Irish? You know what? What is the percentage of people that are religious? Because I grew up thinking that a lot... How about...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:20.449 --> 0:03:24.938]: 
  people were atheists then. I always felt like there was kind of like... I always felt like most people are really atheists.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:21.563 --> 0:03:33.426]: 
  I always felt like there was kind of like... Most people are religious. Everybody is born... Weird to me. Everyone's born into religion and then you kind of like make your choices as you grow up deciding if you want to stick with it or move on. Except if you're from the Middle East or if you try to...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:30.473 --> 0:03:36.902]: 
  Except if you're from the Middle East where if you try to decide to move on you get your head Yo, let's not talk about that

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:35.063 --> 0:03:40.902]: 
  Yo, what's not to talk about? Irish people are primarily Catholic, right? Primarily Catholic.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:40.109 --> 0:03:47.449]: 
  Yeah, well they all pretend they're Catholic but no one's really religious They'll just say they say they are because they like go to mass and they all meet each other going

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:47.145 --> 0:03:51.010]: 
  Go into that, hold on, you said they pretend they are, so explain that more.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:51.010 --> 0:04:01.067]: 
  They don't really believe in God like you don't have the Bible beaters like you have here You have the guys who just kind of go to church on Sundays just so the rest of the neighborhood will see them at church And be like, okay

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:57.186 --> 0:03:59.380]: 
  It is just so the rest of the neighborhood will see them at your home.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:00.291 --> 0:04:32.219]: 
  Bible bumpers Bible thumpers is that what it is called? Yeah, not Bible beaters. We don't beat Bibles No, they're not like though. I like the Alliteration yeah, I'm just here the alliteration kind of came out of the beaters. I mean She get rid of thumper and changes actually yeah, that's a good now because it's like beat off to the Bible. Yeah Say that it's like a cake but Bible beating okay first of all if you were beating off to the Bible God would welcome that everything else is off limits He's like hey you're beating off to the passage I wrote

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:06.214 --> 0:04:12.441]: 
  I like the alliteration kind of came out of the beater. I mean really

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:12.441 --> 0:04:12.930]: 
  I didn't see you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:14.719 --> 0:04:14.871]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:18.228 --> 0:04:21.975]: 
  Yeah, yeah, there's multiple meanings. It's the beginning.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:24.996 --> 0:04:25.739]: 
  Okay, first of all,

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:33.957 --> 0:05:30.505]: 
  But in that same passage, God didn't write the Bible. He screamed over a crowd of people. He's like, Hey, write that shit in it. In that same book, it says, Thou shall not spill thy seed upon thine ground. It also says thou shall not. It doesn't say thine Bible though. It also says in the Bible, Thou shall feed the babies to the crocodiles to appease the garden of youth. What? What? Is this something your mom told you? That's the first Bible. I think it's a little Bible story your mom tells you at night. The first Bible there is like 16 renditions of the Bible. Yeah? And the one that you're talking about has the fucking crocodiles in the pitfall, man. How can you believe in a faith that has been altered throughout time? In the Bible, there was a passage where it said, Changes. 40 kids made fun of a bald man. A bald man, guys, making snapper.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:41.922 --> 0:04:42.681]: 
 硬是フacer

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:42.006 --> 0:04:43.424]: 
  In the birds.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:03.640 --> 0:05:08.449]: 
  What? In what? Is this something your mom told you? That's the first Bible! I think it's a little Bible.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:08.500 --> 0:05:10.221]: 
  That's the first Bible.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:10.221 --> 0:05:10.238]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:13.292 --> 0:05:13.495]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:14.541 --> 0:05:16.937]: 
  that you're talking about has the fucking crocodiles in the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:30.505 --> 0:05:36.006]: 
  And the God came down from the heavens and he said he was pretty kind of

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:36.006 --> 0:05:41.305]: 
  ticked off at that so we sent a big round up and he sent a

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:40.427 --> 0:05:44.460]: 
  And he sent a big bear out and he slaughtered all the four No you're a fucking liar

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:43.262 --> 0:06:51.437]: 
  No, you're a fucking liar! That's a passage in the Bible. I swear, in the Holy Bible. A big bear or a big bear? No, a big gay bear. Big gay bear. No, no, no, no, the sentence. In actual... He wrote on his heart, lit, got off, and just slotted all the kids. Now, was the bear successful? That's the question. Yet, no, all 40 of those kids got fucked. You know what I find fascinating? I love fiction. It's great. Do you know what I find fascinating with the whole Bible thing? And people who like follow it, it's like the Bible is true. It's fact. It was written by the higher-ups. I don't think you'll ever meet somebody that says that the Bible is true. No, that's not true. That's not true. There are people that... There are some people. My mom has actually converted, and she's like, I believe everything in the Bible is true. And I'm like... I've never met anybody in my life that took the Bible as a word. If anything, they push it to the back of their head, and they believe in God. Yeah, but the Bible... No, the Bible. I feel like most people are like... No, no, no, I think most people do... They take it with a grain of salt. However, people see it as a handbook on how to be a good person. Basically, yeah. Yeah, but other people look at it as being like the truth. It's like Adam and Eve really did talk to a spooky snake who ate the golden apple and brought... You ever read those stories? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, golden apple and a spooky snake? You said fucking...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:55.328 --> 0:05:55.699]:

  However, most people see it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:37.988 --> 0:06:38.781]:

No, that's the fuck it's the exes He says no

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:58.444 --> 0:11:59.980]: 
  I know the priest is like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:02.815 --> 0:12:02.950]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:02.950 --> 0:12:03.996]: 
  Wait, no, that's the fucking...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:03.574 --> 0:12:08.991]: 
  That's not what you're supposed to do. You're supposed to do that at that point. You're making your child end up with the exorcist.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:10.037 --> 0:12:15.387]: 
  He says the body of Christ is what he goes to. We held down like a cross over your head.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:14.695 --> 0:12:34.253]: 
  There's the body of Christ and some people choose to be to put their hands out like one hand on there the other To get it and some people with that I noticed a correlation between the people who stuck their tongues out I just see people end up being sluts later on but yeah Some people stuck their tongue out and they accepted the bread in their mouth like straight in their mouth Yeah, some people just took it on their hands

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:28.110 --> 0:12:28.785]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:34.034 --> 0:12:44.597]: 
  And those who have sinned, the fucking cracker, burn their tongue. Yeah, yeah, their hands just fucking melt off. No, their fucking tongues burn. They tuck it in their hand versus taking it. This is actually kind of fascinating.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:38.978 --> 0:12:41.189]: 
  Melt off. No, they're fucking tongues burnt.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:42.944 --> 0:12:48.884]: 
  This is actually kind of fascinating. So you can pick which one you want to do. And when all the kids are. If you want to say it, you put it in your hand. Do you think the

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:46.572 --> 0:12:54.165]: 
  If you wanted to say it, you put it in your head. Do you think the priest is up there like he's doing a panel at a convention? He's like, oh god, I'm gonna get a whole lot of tongue peep.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:51.989 --> 0:12:53.001]: 
  Oh, that freezes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:52.495 --> 0:12:53.254]: 
  I get a whole lot of talk about this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:55.313 --> 0:13:09.471]: 
  That priest is a rockstar on Sundays, like, but we all stood around the altar and we had sponsors like our aunties, our uncles, our parents, or whatever brother's sister's. And if they're of age, they get to, I think they get to sip the wine. But we don't, we just got the fucking cardboard.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:08.914 --> 0:13:33.315]: 
  Get some salty-ass cardboard cracker. He don't give you anything to wash it down. Yeah, no, they just gave us that one. We're like, nah, were you a tongue person or a hand person? What do you think? And you're an ass person. He's turned around and spread his sheets. I feel like you grabbed it and you fucking put it in your hand. And you're like, no. I did that. But he put his tongue out and got the cracker on it, and then he used to wink at girls. But, what do you mean? It's not true. It's just for impressions. But what you do is you look at the face.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:10.804 --> 0:13:12.441]: 
  and he'll give you anything to wash it down.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:16.643 --> 0:13:16.997]:

  You look at your turn to say something.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:10.500 --> 0:22:16.525]: 
  Yeah, so basically potential popes all go into a house, fight to the death and whoever wins, like, smoke comes out of the chimney.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:16.525 --> 0:22]: 
  Let's say it's not what happens. What happens is a priest dies and one of the priests one of the priests comes out of the No, no, yes, so okay, so the public

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22 --> 0:22:30.075]: 
  There's no Pope for a few days. They all go into the house, right? Every night, black smoke comes out of the chimney. That's not what happened! Until!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:28.641 --> 0:23:16.431]: 
  That's not what happened. They pull the priest out of the ground from the fucking... He's trying to tell us what really happened. That's not what happens. There's not a black smoke and a priest rides out of it. I want to hear Niall's Pope Club story. Mine's way better. I had a frat house Re-envisioning the Pope Club. You were pulling up potato popes! No, I wasn't! You said that they were pulling them up out of the ground by their ears! Metaphorically! I didn't even get a Pope's... What the fuck are you fucking saying? I didn't get to finish what I was saying. Like a fucking Pope just buried in the dirt. That was a metaphor. You pull them out of the ground of potential victimized people and you save them. That's what I was saying. You didn't let them finish. I didn't create my landscape of sinners. I actually like your potato story better. With your garden of sinners? Now let Niall finish, guys! No, stories... It's like a kiss concert. Fuck that!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:47.406 --> 0:22:48.267]:

  And you saved him. That's what I would say.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:04.500 --> 0:23:05.530]: 
  I think I'm finished.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:09.664 --> 0:23:11.740]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:41.423 --> 0:23:52.493]: 
  Yeah, but they all have to decide together. Why would you want to be the Pope? It's not like you're gonna get pussy. They get kicked out of the house like big brother. It's like they vote each other. It's not what happens. They sit on the chair and they're like, this Pope is really bothering me.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:47.447 --> 0:23:49.607]: 
  They vote each other. It's not what happened.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:52.493 --> 0:24:04.660]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:57.522 --> 0:24:00.458]: 
  This is the real world, Pope. Yeah, the kick of Gaios.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:03.951 --> 0:24:13.874]: 
  The Pope is a 17 year old girl who's fucking upset about a yellow Ferrari, okay? It's not how popes are. So wait, is the long story short that they keep whittling down till there's one left?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:10.380 --> 0:24:10.684]: 
  I know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:13.874 --> 0:24:18.379]: 
  And then when there's one left, it's white smoke. And they're like, ah, New Pop has been appointed. Everyone's like, hold on. What's it?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:15.932 --> 0:24:16.354]: 
  What's that?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:17.468 --> 0:24:26.732]: 
  Hold on, what's that show with like a girl who has to find her date? It's like a popular show? The Bachelorette. Yeah, this isn't the Bachelorette starring Popes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:22.294 --> 0:24:24.285]: 
  The Bachelor. The Bachelor Ed.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:26.732 --> 0:24:31.440]: 
  Why who's the bachelor in this scenario? A pope. No, but then who are the girls in this scenario? The pope.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:31.002 --> 0:25:33.929]: 
  You just fucking said he does all the ketchup so that Pope's gone On a more serious note Before in the car about this and And it it's something that's always kind of confused me a little bit now I have very religious friends and I have no qualms with religious people until their beliefs start Yeah, somebody puts a fucking finger in my face and tells me I'm wrong Exactly fuck what you're doing. Yeah, but the one thing that always kind of got like I loved having religious debates with my friends But there was one debate that I never got a straight answer about and I was never satisfied with any of the answers They gave me and I'm very open-minded if there was an answer that logically made sense And maybe there's a listener out there No, it's okay who can explain it in a logical way that doesn't end in because the Bible said so No, it's our fuck you. I'm all right. No, I was close. No, oh

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:37.448 --> 0:24:40.654]: 
  that was the tomatoes

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:46.881 --> 0:24:48.450]: 
  I was talking with Stan...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:00.449 --> 0:25:02.153]: 
  You mean all my face?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:06.777 --> 0:25:07.334]: 
  here.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:33.439 --> 0:25:34.992]: 
  No, oh I see what you're saying, no, no.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:34.992 --> 0:27:05.121]: 
  That means that you're still concerned and you're still worried that there might be a God. I'm...maybe...look, I'm not saying there isn't one. I just...I have no reason to believe there is one. But continue. Anyway, so this is it. It's really simple. The idea that Jesus was sacrificed for mankind, that idea bothers me a lot. Yeah, because... Because technically... They skim over. Don't think...well, no, it's not a sacrifice. A sacrifice is when you give something up. They say that God sacrificed his son, right? And also not to mention that he is also God at the same time. But you don't get to give something to people, kill it off, and then get it right back. And expect it in return. Something in return. No, no, no, no, no. That's not a sacrifice. No. If...if he...if Jesus came down, died and went to hell, or disappeared out of existence, that's a sacrifice. You lost something. But God... He got him right back. Yeah, but God... God brought him down for what? 30-some odd years? Yeah. He dies and goes right back up for eternity? Yeah, and he's taken it in heaven. And he's fucking Jesus in heaven. He's got the palace over the top of the hill in heaven. So here we are. We're supposed to feel really terrible about this guy. You know, meanwhile, not mentioning all the other people who were crucified and also tortured in also worse ways. A lot of fucking people that were crucified. Oh, there were a ton of people crucified. So not only that, but the idea that they're like, look, he would sacrifice his son for mankind. Look, if you extrapolate back a little bit, God...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:56.558 --> 0:25:56.575]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:16.859 --> 0:26:17.567]: 
  well that's

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:18.985 --> 0:26:19.002]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:27.827 --> 0:26:29.768]: 
  He got it right back! Yeah, but God!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:35.556 --> 0:26:38.239]: 
  Two pieces in heaven,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:40.905 --> 0:26:41.412]: 
  That's so heavy.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:50.035 --> 0:26:54.152]: 
  in also worse ways. Absolutely worse ways.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:05.121 --> 0:27:10.960]: 
  knows all right? Okay. So he knew he was gonna make Jesus, he knew he was gonna sacrifice his son, like he made him for the...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:10.200 --> 0:27:25.118]: 
  It's not a sacrifice by the way. That's a loan. Yeah, he made him for the purpose of doing it It's like he like he loaned him to us for a little bit. Yeah Yeah, he's like look I'm gonna get rode there I'm gonna give this guy you can do some pretty sweet magic magic trick for you cavemen because you already see much these days so

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:16.275 --> 0:27:20.444]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's like fuck, I'm gonna give you this guy

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:25.118 --> 0:27:31.058]: 
  So basically he's gonna come in, he's gonna make bread and wine and shit, and then I'm gonna kill him off.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:31.058 --> 0:28:41.325]: 
  Why did he die from my sins? I didn't eat and do anything for me. I just feel like Jesus was like the first YouTube star like he just knew how to like touch people. No, no, he was the first like scam artist because like Yeah, he was the first snake oil salesman. What the fuck do you think I'm eating? So you're saying if YouTube existed back then He was like, he's the first snake oil. He had water. He had water. He's like watch when I turn into wine. Yeah, but if YouTube existed then Then like years later, like like four or five years later five years later He fucking died. There would be all these people all these girls coming out talking about how Jesus fiddled them and shit like that or You know, you know, he did it some sermon while he was on route to Jimmy Saville. Yeah No, that's the answer. What's his name? Wait, what you guys talked about this before I always thought and then it's like that cyclical thing where it's like if Nile It's like that What's it called like purple monkey refrigerator thing where like you tell me something that I just keep building it up And then like I've never met Jesus before and then you're like, yeah, he did this and I'm like, oh shit And then I tell Corey and I'm like yet And then there's this blind guy and then he'd put his hands on pretty much just like Sam Pepper

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:34.230 --> 0:27:35.209]: 
  I just feel like Jesus...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:38.753 --> 0:27:39.310]: 
  Oh, he's the first.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:44.929 --> 0:27:45.554]: 
  You serious?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:46.448 --> 0:27:50.987]: 
  This is all we do on YouTube is super snake oil. He was doing us, he was the first.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:52.489 --> 0:28:00.437]: 
  Yeah, but if YouTube existed, then years later, like four or five years ago...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:10.900 --> 0:28:13.364]: 
  Like Jimmy Saville. Yeah, that's right. Wait, wait, wait.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:13.245 --> 0:28:14.275]: 
  That's great.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:17.515 --> 0:28:17.869]: 
  And then it's

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:36.685 --> 0:28:38.997]: 
  It's pretty much just like Sam Pepper.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:38.001 --> 0:28:48.447]: 
  Pepper like around going like yeah, yeah, yeah, he's pretty much like he's like getting girls numbers with my fucking You know he's like he's just going around like doing shit, but and then it was like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:48.008 --> 0:28:55.619]: 
  And then it was like word of mouth kind of thing. Oh, he said pepper in people. He was pinching bottoms, he got crucified, and he paid for it. Pretty much, yeah, he fucking died.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:51.855 --> 0:28:52.952]: 
  Yeah, it's pretty solid.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:53.695 --> 0:28:54.775]: 
  Pretty lucky.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:56.226 --> 0:29:12.949]: 
  That's kind of funny because Sam Pepper got crucified too. Exactly. As well. He should have been. He was God's son. He died for our sins. Sam Pepper died for our sins. Well, it's like what you guys said. Listen, I want to pinch your asses too, alright? Yeah, but don't call around pinching strangers' asses. Jesus did. Sam Pepper did. Allegedly.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:58.707 --> 0:29:01.440]: 
  Exactly. He should have been. He was God's son.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:58.994 --> 0:28:59.010]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:11.498 --> 0:29:14.907]: 
  Allegedly, that's alleged in quotes he may have

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:14.907 --> 0:29:19.024]: 
  Alright, so Nile, you're a Catholic, Cora, you're a blank.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:19.024 --> 0:29:19.514]: 
  Mm-hmm

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:21.775 --> 0:30:09.447]: 
  You're a Buddhist raised in a Christian household. As far as I knew I was atheist because I didn't really... My grandma never talked about God and she was Christian, but she never talked about God ever to me. Not until I was like 18 did I ever realize that the book that she had that was completely in Chinese was actually a holy Bible and that she was translated and that she was praying every fucking meal and every night. I had no idea. She never talked to me about Jesus ever. People like that comfort at the end of the night. How was the Bible? Was it more in turn of things you actually need? Did they have what? Stirred fire recipes and shit? No, fuck. Did Chinese Jesus bring more rice when you needed it? Yeah. I knew it. See? Like there's different excerpts for all... He took a grain of rice and he made it an old one.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:51.390 --> 0:29:51.897]: 
  What's the

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:55.137 --> 0:29:58.444]: 
  Did they have like stir-fried recipes and shit? No, fuck you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:58.444 --> 0:29:59.423]: 
  It did change.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:59.423 --> 0:29:59.457]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:01.397 --> 0:30:03.422]: 
  Yeah. I knew it. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:05.751 --> 0:30:16.922]: 
  He took a grain of rice and he made it at home. And then he took a rat and he was able to serve all the parts of the rat. And that's how we learned. Like everyone was eating rat livers, rat toes.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:11.944 --> 0:30:12.366]: 
  the parts of the video.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:15.910 --> 0:30:18.441]: 
  Yeah, literally they know it started the Black Death. Good job.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:18.070 --> 0:30:21.445]: 
  Good job Jesus. Yeah, good job Chinese Jesus.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:21.445 --> 0:30:36.497]: 
  Yeah, not to be confused with real Jesus Here's my religion story. I grew up Christian a hardcore Christian It took me many years to shake it actually I had a really long calm shake it is like fucking heroin addiction

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:37.206 --> 0:31:58.864]: 
  Truthfully it is. You know what? You know what? You don't fuck you man. You know the first casualty is untucking your shirt and like fucking like wearing your shirt like a deanderthal. Listen, I was cool, alright? I had to tuck my shirt in and wear fucking... I had a really good and a really long conversation with El Cid, Rodrigo. Because we grew up in very similar ways where we were very religious and then it took us a long time to kind of get it out of our heads because we were like... It was like 15 years of somebody battering something into your head. That is literally brainwashing by the way. That is exactly how you actually brainwash people. Exactly, but you know like my parents weren't religious. They just knew that church was good for me. So every Sunday I'd go to Sunday school and whatever and I remember there was this one... I would always go to sermon after Sunday school and I'd sit and listen to my priest. He was a fucking great guy. He was a really nice guy. And they were always so fucking boring and I was a kid. I didn't understand what the hell he was talking about. So it's like anything else. You turn on the TV and mash or something comes on. You don't get what the fuck you're looking at. So you change the fucking channel. You can't change the fucking channel in church. No. And then at the end of every sermon he says... You can improvise and plug your ears. You got that...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:37.915 --> 0:30:38.185]: 
  It is.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:38.185 --> 0:30:38.303]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:49.170 --> 0:30:49.440]: 
  Listen.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:55.229 --> 0:30:56.174]: 
  And really good.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:12.880 --> 0:31:14.669]: 
  Yeah, that is literally.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:17.537 --> 0:31:17.622]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:58.324 --> 0:32:01.665]: 
  You know that thing where it was like he'd tell the same story and he'd go, I've heard this one before.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:01.463 --> 0:35:06.244]: 
  Yeah, no because I never got old enough to do that but at the end of every sermon Section B3 I heard they offer fuck sake like this is a rerun But he would say like if anybody wants to devote their life to God come up here and One day I was so fucking bored in church I just got up there and I was like here I am and everyone was like Yeah, he's gonna devote his life to God and it was almost like everybody else was waiting for somebody to walk Didn't want to do it like we were all fucking excited because something was finally happening. Yeah for me Sorry, I don't know if I like coming to your story. No, that's fine for me. I have to finish it though because it's ridiculous Okay, well, I guess for me My church stories were more like the stuff I remember growing up as being Christian always felt goofy to me like Adam and Eve and Noah's Ark and Moses always felt like these like fucking Disney fairy tales which like it's like By like a four-year-old woman Yeah, this guy who part of the sea I'm like when did this come out of fucking Disney like a part of the sea and now I had a fucking ship with every animal in the world sailed over a flood a talking snake and the first-ever man and woman It's just like I'm like man now. I'm just thinking back and it was like shit. Are my Sunday school teachers okay now Understand I think the only thing I remember are those three stories. I know there's tons of passages But to me I always thought Chris Jandy had a bunch of stories as guidelines even as a kid I thought it was like oh, this is like sharing and be nice to your neighbors I didn't know these people out there that are like well, you know, I'm still cool. I understand like the guidelines are definitely like Genuine in a lot of ways, but at the same time is common sense, you know, don't rape and murder people. Yeah Yeah, it's pretty fucking simple I want you to get back in your story I just want to throw in there really quickly you said that you ran up there and you said that you were gonna devote your life to God Because you were born well, no But if for some reason I had this weird moment in my head where I was thinking almost like in a from dusk till dawn Moment like if there was ever like a vampire Apocalypse or something if I get like we would need you you like Stanford You'd be drinking a beer and we'd be so royally fucked it was like snapper wait you you devoted yourself to God Do this shit Does that work did I get the power? Yeah, you went up there the priest gave it to you whether you used it or not It's a secret code to use it though. You have to say the secret prayer. Do you guys miss ice? Yeah? I wasn't I was I had my no Let me tell you something. I know let me tell you something You know why I was I was baptized because I heard the priest takes you out for ice cream if you do all that wait Do the hold your hand no we brush your hair like slightly we went to Dairy Queen And I'm sitting there eating my Sunday, and he's like so how do you feel about God? And I was like oh fucking love me

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:05.209 --> 0:32:06.559]: 
  at the end of every sermon section.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:07.251 --> 0:32:07.403]: 
  I heard

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:07.403 --> 0:32:08.500]: 
  They offer fucks sake

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:08.500 --> 0:32:09.276]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:09.276 --> 0:32:09.293]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:28.497 --> 0:32:30.032]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:33.441 --> 0:32:34.133]:

  Rogers like Rogers was awesome. He was the only like guy who like it didn't sin God has a sense of hope he's up there God has a sense of humor because he created humans and also God has a sense of humor because he created humans and monkeys So the atheists argue that we came from monkeys and that we weren't born at the same time

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:16.729 --> 0:38:17.640]: 
  I hope he's up there.

  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:11.438 --> 0:39:36.987]: 
  We just gotta make the better decisions. That is the name of this episode. Purgatory is Sleepy Cat. Or just purgatory. What it is. So you have Good Boy Town and Bad Boy Town, right? Yeah, and then you- You're a good boy, you go up north, and you're a bad boy, you go down south. Why are they working together? You know, if I hated somebody, why did I be like, listen, this guy's a piece of shit. Can you punish him for eternity? Like, can you set him on fire for the rest of this fucking game? I didn't even set it up for this fucking game of life.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:21.057 --> 0:39:21.867]: 
  Right.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:37.881 --> 0:40:08.273]: 
  I don't understand how it's like, yeah. It didn't have to be boring. It didn't have to be boring, God. Give me back my choice. So what's the story like Lucifer's kicked out of heaven, right? Because he's like a fallen angel. He's a fallen angel. He was jealous that God loved the humans or something. Right, okay, so he's in hell, right? Yeah, this is propaganda from God. You know what I think? Yeah, he's probably the nice guy. I think God wants to fuck with us. So if he doesn't like fucking God, then why is he doing God favors and punishing people?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:37.949 --> 0:39:40.395]: 
  I don't understand how it's like that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:49.356 --> 0:39:49.491]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:49.491 --> 0:39:49.542]:

  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:01.270 --> 0:40:01.810]: 
  M cont.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:08.594 --> 0:40:13.184]: 
  He's employed by God still? Yeah, he's like still mad.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:10.095 --> 0:40:19.900]: 
  I have a question. I have a question. I have a question. He's making like minimum Lucifer wage. Do you think either God or Jesus, do you think they might be closet homosexuals?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:21.233 --> 0:40:21.992]: 
  Why?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:21.992 --> 0:42:00.053]: 
  Because they have such an avid hatred for gays. Yeah, most people hate gays a lot. They are gays. Yeah, they definitely spread it. You know what I'm saying? I want to know where that whole stigma came from. Like, some guy saw another guy with another guy and there was a... They had such a problem with it that they just like, righted it into the Bible. Or was there a prophet... They wrote it into ancient tongue. They did! There was like, fucking facts. No, but it's like seriously, what could have possibly... Who thought to put that in there and you know what I mean? Like who was like, yeah, totally fucked those guys. God hates rapists. And it's like, are you sure? Yes, God told me. God told me he hates gay people. It's like, what? God came down from the heavens and told me he hates gays. And then someone's like, yeah, let's put that in the book. It just seems so bizarre to me. It was effective, it's still going on. As if it fucking matters what your fucking neighbor's doing. I know! You got murder, you got plagues, you got starvation, you got all the wars. You've got all this fucking shit. But then you got two guys kissing and someone's like, oh! I don't get two fucks if the guy at Wawa is fucking another guy. What difference does it make? It has no draw on my life. I just don't understand why it is a crime. That's what's so bizarre to me. It fascinates me when I... The one thing that I've noticed is the difference. My drill fucking business is what I see. My drill business, Corey. My drill business, Mick. No, my drill business. Not what? They give the argument of the sanctity of marriage. I know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:25.266 --> 0:40:30.936]: 
  Yeah, most people hate games a lot. They are games. Yeah, people who are like really into games. Yeah, they definitely spread it. You don't even care.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:30.936 --> 0:40:31.139]: 
  Have a nice day.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:39.762 --> 0:40:40.724]: 
  1zne에

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:41.888 --> 0:40:43.373]: 
  that they've like, righted it in the mouth.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:47.389 --> 0:40:48.587]: 
  They did, they were like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:02.340 --> 0:41:07.960]: 
  I'm sure? Yes, God told me. You're gay people. God told me he hates gay people. It's like, what?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:15.081 --> 0:41:16.448]: 
  It just seems so bizarre to me.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:17.039 --> 0:41:18.996]: 
  It was effective, it's still going on!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:18.996 --> 0:41:19.688]: 
  I know

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:22.995 --> 0:41:23.738]: 
  No!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:25.560 --> 0:41:26.792]: 
  You've got all the

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:31.568 --> 0:41:31.956]: 
  Oh

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:51.750 --> 0:41:54.855]: 
  I am. Now, mind your own business. Think of the edit.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:52.004 --> 0:41:52.493]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:57.825 --> 0:42:05.369]: 
  marriage I know the second thing of the argument that a run the sanctity of marriage marriage is a holy sacrament just like communion just like confirmation all that

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:03.074 --> 0:42:14.565]: 
  Just like communion, just like confirmation. So worry about your own fucking marriage. However... Do you know what the number one cause of divorce is? Marriage. Yeah, I love marriage. Alright? Hey! Hey!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:10.667 --> 0:42:10.819]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:12.085 --> 0:42:18.447]: 
  I was like, you're fucking a fucking fan of me. I'm not a fan, dude. I didn't even first ever stand a comedian so that jerk.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:18.447 --> 0:42:22.885]: 
  But yeah back in Jesus but thing is the difference in the Bible

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:19.763 --> 0:42:30.681]: 
  Jesus but thing is the difference in the Bible in Ireland and here is that No one is divorced really in Ireland like a cop like Rarely rarely anyone is divorced down, but here's me

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:30.310 --> 0:42:42.072]: 
  You guys meet when you're like 23 and just put up with it. No, but yeah, no, I think it's, they might be scared. I don't know. Or they, but here I've noticed. Everybody's divorced. It's hardcore Catholic over there though. Over here is hardcore.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:40.823 --> 0:42]: 
  Over here is hardcore Christian.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42 --> 0:43:30.689]: 
  They are that's the thing they all like they like I don't know anyone like in Ireland who like rub fucking the Bible It's brownie points. That's always looking down upon the main driving point for every human being ever Regardless of anything they do any walk of life. They have is fear. That's it everyone. I've met you wake up in the morning Why do you get your work done? I'm afraid I'm gonna get fired. I'm afraid this is gonna say marriages You're afraid you're gonna be alone. Oh well, and then there's one religion ties in I'm pretty it's pretty safe to say that Why do you support God? I don't want to go to hell and be burned for it. It's pretty here It's pretty safe to say that all my friends parents are divorced like are your parents divorced? Yeah, your parents are divorced My parents divorced and remarried. Your parents are divorced. It's a happy thing. That is crazy Like that never happens in Ireland that is so rare and here it's just

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:51.522 --> 0:42:52.467]: 
  on the main driving

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:00.280 --> 0:43:01.461]: 
  Everyone I've met you where-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:05.241 --> 0:43:10.439]: 
  You're saying marriages and you're afraid you're gonna be alone? Oh well, and then there's religion ties in. I'm really...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:14.421 --> 0:43:14.961]: 
  It's pretty sheer.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:18.944 --> 0:43:24.614]: 
  divorced? Yeah. You're prince of divorce. My parents were divorced and remarried. You're prince of divorce and happy marriage. That is crazy.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:29.035 --> 0:43:37.101]: 
  Like you like I you should get you should get divorced like I think because it's also a straight arrow

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:35.684 --> 0:43:45.640]: 
  It's also a strange era like where, like for example, my parents were married when they were 19. Bad idea. I'mma fuck up now. There's no way I'm gonna get married now.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:42.417 --> 0:43:42.602]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:45.606 --> 0:43:47.007]: 
  Yeah, no, Stan, but you're doing it wrong.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:47.007 --> 0:44:42.002]: 
  Right, like you you're what I want to be in like a few years. You know, it's so funny This was the generation back then we would all have children right now. My parents are my god My dad and mom were my age. They were already like dating. They're already like dude It's pretty common to have kids when you're a fucking teenager. Yeah, but you know what's interesting is anytime I've spoken with someone and they mentioned they've gotten a divorce if you ever say oh, I'm sorry The response a hundred percent of the time that I've experienced is They got a divorce because they weren't happy divorces don't just happen accidentally I mean, yeah, there might be some cases where you know, it wasn't necessarily Mutual but for the most part if people are willing to get a divorce It's probably been building up for a while and that they are not happy. So what do you do this? I actually don't know I don't know the statistic here, but is it safe to say that most marriages end?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:04.202 --> 0:44:04.455]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:16.757 --> 0:44:19.575]: 
  I'm never gonna fucking say that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:35.640 --> 0:44:35.877]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:38.425 --> 0:44:39.150]: 
  I actually don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:42.002 --> 0:44:43.184]: 
  in the voice of America.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:43.319 --> 0:44:47.942]: 
  I don't know if it's most... I would say... I would say the... But I don't know... Put everyone, my friend...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:44.584 --> 0:44:44.939]: 
  I would say

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:44.939 --> 0:45:51.629]: 
  I would say that it's rare to see a very happy marriage. Sometimes it works well. Sometimes it works very well. But you know what, sometimes you do fucking let's plays and you get 8 billion fucking subscribers. Guess what? You're part of the.0001% At the same time, I'll say this for the record, fuck marriage. If you find somebody that you really like, just spend time with them forever. Why get married? That's what I always say when I get a girlfriend or whatever. I was like, I said this since I was a kid. There's a lot of residual shit. Family pressure. Taxes. I said this since I was a kid. It is interesting that the government promotes it in terms of how the system is built to give certain benefits to married couples. It's just interesting that the system actually is built around that. There's a lot of factors. They're like ladies, they grow up and they think about their ideal marriage and stuff like that. But they don't... I wouldn't say it's another form of brainwashing, but at the same time it's like... It's just something that's kind of in your bones from a very early age.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:47.942 --> 0:44:49.613]: 
  I will say this. Parents and of course, as we want to.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:53.865 --> 0:44:55.772]: 
  Sometimes it works very well. Sometimes, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:23.498 --> 0:45:24.730]: 
  What are you gonna get, man?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:36.205 --> 0:45:36.711]: 
  TRIGGERED

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:50.751 --> 0:45:59.408]: 
  I don't think humans are made to be monogamous because like They most certainly aren't when you just spend your life with one person like I can't

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:55.139 --> 0:45:56.556]: 
  They most certainly aren't. No.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:58.851 --> 0:46:12.908]: 
  Why can't we just jump in a big old pile of humans and just be happy? That's what I'm just happy and horny. That's how it's supposed to be, but uh... Why can't you surround yourself with people and spend time with people you care about? What you really meant to say was why can't you surround yourself with people you care about?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:03.441 --> 0:46:05.922]: 
  That's probably the big clusterfuck.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:07.069 --> 0:46:07.575]: 
  What are you saying?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:12.908 --> 0:46:14.730]: 
  people you want to fucking fuck them.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:14.849 --> 0:46:20.502]: 
  Yes! Well, I mean, that's part of it, but... But no, but ever since I was a kid, I always said, like, I...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:20.502 --> 0:46:35.942]: 
  I said this so any like girlfriend I ever have always be like it's not just you I've always said that I'm always gonna get preen up and I'm always gonna get I'm always going to not want to get married But if you if I find someone I love who really really wants to get married and that's what they really want All right fair enough like I'll probably just

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:35.942 --> 0:46:39.199]: 
  fucking buy the bullet and do it. But if you married them, you would be monogamous.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:39.199 --> 0:46]: 
  Yeah, well no, I would be monogamist, like if any relationship ever happened monogamist, like I don't He's talking special case Yeah, yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:43.688 --> 0:47:20.948]: 
  He's talking special case. Yeah. Yeah, just a very special case, but yeah versus What's it called? Versus obligation. I'll break it to do so. Yeah. Yeah, yeah Yeah, but that's the thing but that but that is part of marriage the Part of it and it's not even supposed to be a shameful word when you say it in the context of marriage is Obligation is a part of the job description. You should through better or worse right for better or for worse So I mean obligation beforehand the obligation to get married well Yeah before any of the obligation even kicks in that is it and socially though that is an obligation you stick around with a partner along the

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:52.328 --> 0:46:53.492]: 
  to do so.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:20.948 --> 0:47:24.002]: 
  long enough people start asking questions if you don't get married.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:24.002 --> 0:47:28.947]: 
  start pressuring you to do so. I think though that the end result is because they want you to have kids is really

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:28.575 --> 0:47:29.740]: 
  is really what it is.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:30.010 --> 0:47:33.452]: 
  Yeah well yeah, yeah, we're going to advance the human race.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:33.233 --> 0:47:43.442]: 
  Like I don't know I actually just don't know but is Monogamy like is a mom and dad and a kid situation is that better for the kid than divorced situation?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:43.442 --> 0:48:24.449]: 
  Is it well look look at it this way like um, I guess it's different because for me I didn't my dad my parents were divorced when I was one So my dad was my stepdad. We were divorced when I was two. Yeah, my mom got divorced when I was like Like six seven months old But my dad was my stepdad and I always considered him more of like my father's right so it never I guess it really just Depends on how you're raised on absolutely 100% I do not think you need to have one male one female. You do not need to have two Parents, I think you have one strong parental figure You're you're said I mean look I was raised by my grandma primarily because my mom was working in

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:59.440 --> 0:48:00.098]: 
  What's old?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:03.743 --> 0:48:04.080]: 
  great.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:24.449 --> 0:48:28.364]: 
  and she was in college and I never met my dad and my mom didn't get remarried in college. Isn't that cool?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:27.874 --> 0:48:28.937]: 
  Isn't that common in Asia?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:28.364 --> 0:48:59.144]: 
  Coming in Asia though? What? To have a- Grandma raised you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, they have the whole family unit. My grandfather was still in Asia at the time and he would come to visit occasionally. But yeah, my grandma pretty much raised me. And I think I turned out OK, honestly. You know what I mean? And so I don't think it's a matter of- Standing citizen. Well, I don't think it's a matter of, you know, oh, you need to have a mom and a dad in order for you to, you know, whatever the case is. I think that's a very bizarre and closed-minded view of it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:46.302 --> 0:48:47.280]: 
  Standing citizen.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:59.144 --> 0:49:03.717]: 
  people with a mom and a dad, you know, straight out of a picture book and they're the biggest

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:03.717 --> 0:49:10.365]: 
  fucking assholes I know. I have no problem believing that you could be raised by fucking wolves.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:10.365 --> 0:49:14.601]: 
  and if they were good wolves that you would come out as a decent person. You'd be fine, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:13.437 --> 0:50:41.440]: 
  You be fine. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. I want to talk about how in general how sinning is looked down upon And it's like there's so many things that are considered sitting like the seven deadly sins like gluttony Sloth Get them all lust mm-hmm greed. Yeah Wrath is theft what wrath isn't it sin? It is Is it really seven? How do you define wrath? It's when you're coming down on somebody Envy envy so the seven deadly sins are less gluttony greed sloth wrath envy and pride right and What's funny is like half of those things you fucking do on a regular basis half of those things you can't like live you can't actually So fucking sorry that the last three months of my life are horrible and then I was finally yeah I'm proud of something you made a fucking macaroni makes you think for your mom and and she's so proud of it You have pride because that is that a fucking sin and then now both of you are fucked I study I studied I studied for 12 years to become a fucking surgeon and I can't be proud of myself You know what I mean? I want to sit but you could also spin so many things like even even if like doing good, right? Even if doing good you you're someone who it likes to give right because it makes you feel good Yeah, so you give a lot. Yeah with now you're being greedy You are because you're doing something for yourself. Where's this? How much you give you're gonna feel good. Where's the seven lovely sins?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:33.417 --> 0:49:36.572]: 
  It is, it's actually, yeah, Rack is one of them. Is it really? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:37.990 --> 0:49:41.230]: 
  It's like coming down on somebody.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:52.739 --> 0:49:53.447]: 
  Have those things.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:55.624 --> 0:49:56.181]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:56.181 --> 0:49:58.004]:

  This feels good.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:41.440 --> 0:50:58.602]: 
  The seven lovely sins are chastity, temperance, charity, diligence, patient, kindness, and humility. Oh wow, I didn't even fucking know. Those are just the opposites. So one of them are chastity, which means you're not allowed to have sex. Right. So in fairness to the...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:48.089 --> 0:50:52.712]: 
  Oh wow, I didn't fucking know. Those are just the opposites.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:55.986 --> 0:50:56.087]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:56.762 --> 0:51:12.507]: 
  Yeah, so in fairness, okay, so it's basically just don't have fun, right? Yeah, just don't have sex. Don't be proud of yourself. No, I think you know if the seven deadly wait sex is supposed to be fun Well, it's not yeah, well, I guess it's like it's the opposite to the

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:06.499 --> 0:51:07.107]: 
  wait so

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:12.507 --> 0:51:24.505]: 
  the vice of lust. So it's the virtue in comparison. So the opposite of gluttony will be temperance. The opposite of greed is charity, sloth, diligence, wrath, patience, envy, kindness, and pride in humility.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:19.662 --> 0:51:19.965]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:26.969 --> 0:53:45.495]: 
  I think all of those sins and actually all those sins and all of their opposites I think it's if you take any of them to the extreme. Yes, that's when it's a problem No, but I guess the idea that any of them are technically a sin. It's like Jesus.

Just give me two fucking seconds to just fucking get my brain together. I don't like these kinds. Now, does the devil like split every single time there's a new person? Because I'm imagining that if the more people that were there, like, let's say back in the beginning, there's only like, what, like a few billion people down in hell. But now there's like, there's like, you know, billions and billions of people in hell at this point. So it's like they either had to hire more people. Yeah. So, Mick. Or how do they manage that? So, Mick, isn't the point. The way they hired enough demons to fucking punish that many people. Right. Isn't the. Especially at the rate that we saw. The wallets that coming out of. Isn't the whole point. Blow minimal wage is bullshit. Unless they're converting the people that go down as like new recruits. Isn't the whole point of Christian, or the Christian viewer room?

  There's a whole set coming out of it. Is this the whole point?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:50.494 --> 0:58:54.595]: 
  I think it's just the Christian view religion is that there's gonna be a holy war between

If you put everything out there, all your flaws, out into the world, there's nothing anyone can say that can hurt you. Because you've already put it all out there. If they call you out on something, if they make fun of you, guess what? You've already said it a hundred times, and everybody already knows. But I thought about this. If Brad Pitt- Bulletproof. Bulletproof. Bulletproof. If Brad Pitt is a 10, he's the 10.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:12.940 --> 1:06:15.572]:

So if you have the standard that you have to live up to these days, like, so You're obviously never going to look exactly like Brad Pitt You're not gonna look as much as he, as like him As he does? So you're not gonna look, so if he's the like, ten, you're not, you're obviously gonna be under that If he's, I don't know what I'm talking about, I'm kinda drunk, guys I look like John Oliver Yeah, you do You do But you're, you're cuter than John Oliver Yeah, you're cuter But anyway, so when did we start losing our religion?

I'm pretty sure he's got a One comedy movie that Brad Pitt has ever been in there's three guys sitting here name one I don't even know Burn after reading oh What's the one where he was a stoner? That's not a comedy movie true romance. Yeah He was a name one. That's not like an obscure fucking black comedy name one where he's been funny Mr. Mr. Mr. Loaning you're lowering the categories. You're like fucking changing the variables. No, but however like you know what? I'm not a fucker is old and useless. I agree. He's flabby pit. That was my retort flabby pit Yeah, I'm sure that would hurt his feelings and you go home and go like David God I think David Beckham has like the personality of a fucking cardboard. I'm so sorry But that guy He's like it's not Lucid though, it's not mutually exclusive. I think Brad Pitt could be funny, but like he actually is quoted on saying

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:56.721 --> 1:07:58.830]: 
  I'm pretty sure he's got a new company.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:09.495 --> 1:08:09.512]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:11.436 --> 1:08:14.018]:

  That guy.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:52.274 --> 1:09:00.441]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:00.441 --> 1:09:12.929]: 
  That's fucking hilarious move on back to religion so when I lost my religion is when I was like 16 or 17 I started watching like YouTube videos because I actually I wanted to believe in God I was because I was I didn't know a passing out

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:03.344 --> 1:09:04.542]: 
  So when I lost my religion...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:12.608 --> 1:09:16.979]: 
  Then you read a comment section and then that was it. I didn't know what, I didn't know what pass cut was.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:14.987 --> 1:09:18.160]: 
  I didn't know what pasca- Fuck God is dead

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:16.979 --> 1:10:05.444]: 
  I didn't know what Pascal's wager was when I was that age and Pascal's wager is basically like all right So there's two scenarios God exists and God doesn't exist if you believe that God exists You're going to heaven if you believe that God doesn't exist You're not going to heaven if heaven doesn't exist. That's fine if you believe God exists. You're happy You'll not you'll just rot for eternity, but like basically it's like a two out of three Most scenarios that wins because you might if you just believe in God you'll go to heaven if it doesn't exist You won't notice because you'd be dead so that's Pascal's wager So I kind of fell for that and I was looking at religious videos to believe in it But the more religious videos I want to make sure you were right Yeah So the more religious videos I watched the more holes I found in the more like I found out how stupid it was and that's just how We stopped believing it. I never gave it much thought until then so it was I like how like technology

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:52.028 --> 1:09:53.952]: 
  I was. I was believing it to make sure you were right.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:02.929 --> 1:11:17.483]: 
  I like how like technology was introduced into your world and you're sitting there like Looking at like it's like I need to pull up religious videos Yeah, but for me like you asked me but for me it was back when I was questioning like the Disney fucking fantasy stories I heard like I yeah, I told you like fucking how was some dude gonna get to Egypt? How is he means the Disney fantasy stone? Yeah, like Moses splitting the fucking sea and some dude making a boat for a flood that fucking put every one animal On the fucking boat. Yeah, or every kind of not to mention that the only human survivors of that would have been some old man And his three daughters exactly like to me Talk to me We don't bring that up. All right, you don't have to be like a fucking Genius to know that if you put a lion with the chicken in the same room or on the same boat Or even a lion and some other small animal the lion is gonna fucking kill the animal completely pointless They I mean like they try to like you read into that story. No, it's just like common sense Here's what I want to know with Noah's Ark. What were they feeding the lions? Exactly though. They said they had food wheat blinds. I don't eat wheat

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:07.604 --> 1:10:08.852]: 
  Bo cop shoot Terry so program89

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:11.924 --> 1:10:13.830]: 
  To reinforce your beliefs.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:12.987 --> 1:10:14.067]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:26.942 --> 1:10:27.263]:

  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:42.214 --> 1:10:42.248]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:42.248 --> 1:10:48.306]: 
  Exactly, like to me, to me, that just needs... We don't bring that up in the minute.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:04.439 --> 1:11:06.565]: 
  You're right into that story.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:04.506 --> 1:11:04.877]: 
  I'm like, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:08.050 --> 1:11:08.607]: 
  Here's what I want.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:19.457 --> 1:12:25.388]: 
  They had to kill off some- That's the name of the podcast! Lines don't eat wheat! That's why they brought fucking like, eight fucking things to chickens because they were gonna have to feed them to another animals. God gave- Yeah, they doubled up on the chickens. Because they had to give- and the lambs, because they were gonna have to feed those to the wolves. God gave the chickens passaways and said, if they have babies, feed them to the lions and other smaller animals. Because it's a doggy dog world. Got it. And God understands that. It was its own ecosystem, essentially. Well, that's what I'm saying. It's like, people are looking at this now and they're saying, you know what, I know those are ridiculous, but they are guidelines. They just feel they're guidelines. But it's like, also like, does creationism- But it's nonsense. It's completely nonsense. It's clearly obviously nonsense. But it's like the people who believe that the Grand Canyon was created from Noah's Ark. And it's like- The Grand Canyon was when I walked to my grandma's house and dragged my peepee on the ground. Nega! Where's the canyon there? But in contrast to where like, Moses was, it's not even in the same fucking area. Yeah. So it's like, how the fuck did, how did he make this boat and then pick it up and lift it? They flood the place. A few million yards.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:21.989 --> 1:11:22.174]:

  Yeah, it wasn't like Evan Almighty where they flooded downtown New York and the rest of the world was cool. Yeah. That was fucking terrible. It was totally fucking terrible. It was just like a giant tidal wave. All these panda bears came from fucking China, jumped on a boat, traveled the block, got off and then went home.

I mean, I never, like I said, I never had religion really in my life, at least not that I knew about. It was never imposed in my life. This is the religious podcast. I remember not long ago, we were at a bar thinking, OK, we'll touch on religion, and then we'll talk about potato chips. Oh, yeah. We'll get to the potato chips. We still got some time. And then now it was like, oh, you meant potato chips. I thought you were talking about chips, chips, because in Ireland they called fries chips. Also made of potatoes. Also made of potatoes. Which is an Irish emblem. That's fair. Is it the potato? Man, you guys are fucking pathetic, man. That's all you have. What are you talking about? They make whiskey and they got Guinness. That was unfair. Cut all that.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:51.443 --> 1:12:52.641]:

  That's the end.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:30.981 --> 1:13:33.394]: 
  We're putting you talking about the make whiskey and they got

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:37.394 --> 1:16:13.403]: 
  Pretty much you're so fucking sorry your blood is made of that shit. I'm sorry I'm sorry even if you had no Irish heritage now your blood is Irish Ireland. Please forgive me. I love you so much Um, I was gonna say that but as I got older I mean I was always kind of like looking for God a little bit not looking but I was always very open Yeah, I ended up weird Christian youth groups even though I wasn't Christian all sorts of weird ass shit human being search for Your your your reason that's just that's not your when you're younger you look for whatever you know I've just kind of like I've I've Settled into the idea that I don't believe in God. I'm not saying there is no God There's just nothing that's made me believe that that's a stance that a lot of people say I take that right and then I would just rather Layback on my on my Buddhist roots and that's pretty much what I do it But it's our armor. It's what came right and it's not even a religion more than is just Yeah, and they're good values to it's what it's what stamper said Stampers said people just want to find like like value or like they want to find purpose So they want to find the reasons for things that happen like you see these stories of people like oh I had a near-death experience where I saw a white light and all this stuff But it's been proven that the same experience can be held in like those things where people go in space shuttles to go Rarely fast and you know what the same kind of connect. Hold on and they both see like the same thing And it's like you put two and two together and you start questioning all these other things like you start questioning like spirits and stuff And you're like so you wonder why these people who go around with these little electric boxes to like outlets that get like huge Like lighting things or they see like lighting and stuff It's like it could be so much other things because I would love I would love to see a ghost honestly I would be scared. No because then I would know that there was Can I be am it seems like oh it seems like everybody growing up In my life has seen and felt no they say they do no, but they've say they say they do but me the fucking Experiencing stories are very fun. Is it and seeing shadows, but I have never seen a ghost say one thing And then I'm gonna let Nile John when I was again back to what Mick was saying about fucking brainwashing when I was in the second Or third grade a teacher from a neighboring classroom. She like borderline died, right? So she came in to talk to all of us She stood up in front of the class and told everybody about how she she was about to die And she saw she went to heaven and she saw these pink clouds and and life was great And then she sat and talked to us about the afterlife and how heaven is waiting for us and it's great

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:39.486 --> 1:13:39.503]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:39.503 --> 1:13:43.992]: 
  Blood is made of that shit. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Even if you had no Irish heritage now-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:57.492 --> 1:13:57.812]: 
  I know

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:03.179 --> 1:14:07.802]: 
  Yeah, but you were you like that's not true when you're younger you look for whatever you know

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:16.949 --> 1:14:17.337]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:25.572 --> 1:14:27.546]: 
  But bootstarr harmless it's what Pamela

 SPEAKER_00 [1:14:25.943 --> 1:14:25.994]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:30.465]: 
  It's just, yeah, it's an A.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:51.863 --> 1:14:54.664]: 
  Yeah, and do it. Can I explain?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:12.822 --> 1:15:13.379]: 
  I would

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:14.712 --> 1:15:16.905]: 
  Honestly, people say like, would you be scared? No.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:18.492 --> 1:15:21.614]: 
  I would too! I'd be like, what am I saying?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:22.238 --> 1:15:24.179]: 
  I can see it! I would be amped.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:33.578 --> 1:15:36.042]: 
  Experience and glad stories are very fun.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:14.095 --> 1:17:03.994]: 
  This is in public school. Yeah, see that's not a fact. She sat there and she fucking told us that. And I think back to that, I'm like are you... Because when you die, Stamper, what you call it? Like granted, I understand that I'm not gonna write off anything that she saw. No, but at the same time that you should come to fucking a class and say that they haven't exist and that we... That always... You shouldn't, I'll tell you why. That always made me mad because it's like a teacher coming by, oh you get all the fucking ice cream you want, it's the best. You gotta also think about hanging yourself. But we all respected her because she was like 96 years old and we all sat and looked up at her and we were like... Because she was a white sandwich. Like yeah, this is a fucking... She... This is it. It's not a fact. This is proof. You can't take that. This is proof. You can't take that from me. And this is shit that drags behind you for the next fucking 10 years of your life before you write it off. You can't take that from me.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:15.968 --> 1:16:17.537]: 
  Yeah, see that's not fact. She's sick.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:21.722 --> 1:16:21.925]: 
  because

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:29.519 --> 1:16:31.459]: 
  No, at the same time that you should...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:36.724 --> 1:16:37.467]: 
  Howdy what?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:48.992 --> 1:16:50.444]: 
  or there will be dust.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:50.444 --> 1:16:50.950]: 
  Like, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:53.380 --> 1:16:54.004]: 
  It's not a fast...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:54.696 --> 1:16:55.236]: 
  You can't take it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:56.805 --> 1:16:57.632]: 
  This is shit.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:03.353 --> 1:17:40.056]: 
  You can't take that as proof though because when you die it's like it's been proven that like your your brain and your Penial gland in your brain, which also is known as your third eye releases is a chemical Penial call it called Dimethyltryptamine which is a chemical that is the same chemical that's that that releases when you dream So dimethyl and you drugs yeah, there's a drug called psychedelic Yeah, there's a psychedelic called DMT which you can smoke or you can do this other version of it called Iowashka which lasts longer I don't know something about that but dimethyltryptamine releases from your Penial gland and pretty much it's it has the same effect in dreams And it's to it stops the trauma of death. So like so you're pretty much dreaming as you do

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:22.439 --> 1:17:22.945]: 
  drugs.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:23.789 --> 1:17:24.447]: 
  Was so lucky

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:40.056 --> 1:17:44.174]: 
  die and like when you're dying you think of heaven because that's what like what

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:44.174 --> 1:17:46.941]: 
  What else are you thinking of? You're like, I hope I go to heaven. So like, you're gonna dream of heaven.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:46.941 --> 1:18:04.525]: 
  And that's what happens. That's what people think. Listen, make sense. Life is. Wrong, maybe. Make sense. So, Stanford. It's probably more right than the alternative. Life is. Well, I'm just, I'm so used to getting corrected by people in YouTube. Stanford. Let him, let him. Life is like a hurricane.

  I don't know that. I like how God's having a heart with heart with only you. He's really trying to justify himself. He's like, I'm gonna get all the clouds, I'm gonna come into human form. I'm gonna be with your fucking man. Sam, I'm giving y'all like God's Sam. What if he didn't come out of the clouds though and he was like 4'3 and he was like kind of a midget and he was like, Hey guys, I'm God. I just really want to cut, look, I'm doing magic, I'm putting fire in my hand. And he just put fire in his hand and he's like, yeah, okay, so anyway. And he's looking up at you and he's like, don't fucking. Jesus is like way bigger and he's like, Dad, oh my God. He's embarrassing me. And he's like, Dad, you give me back my roller skates Dad. What if Jesus comes down and like. There's one beer left. You know what, it's fine. I don't want to. Any time I hear about like Jesus coming down, I'd only want him to come down like 4 comes down. Like he'd come down like a comet, hit the pavement and there's like a fucking crater left by him. But he's just wearing his like nice little robes, but he clearly has like the density of like fucking star. So after God does the speech, Jesus comes and he's like carrying a bunch of papers from heaven and he's like, you know, running down. And he's giving out people and they're like, what is this? He's like, oh, my son, he wrote a new book. I need you guys also to read this. And tell me what you think because he's kind of a little nervous about writing again. Yeah, give me some criticism. Most people just want him to sign it. Yeah, like a convention. But the Bible is actually like, yo, where were you during 9-11? You remember that? That was pretty fucking bad. It's tempered like the Bible actually been written. I was writing my book. I was actually more concerned where Spider-Man was when that shit happened.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:52.485 --> 1:25:53.954]: 
  He's trying to like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:55.320 --> 1:25:57.497]:

  Actually, that's true. I would be too. I'd be like, come save me. Spiderman, please! Yeah, a little electric on the street. You know, all you had to do was throw webs up between the Twin Towers. We're talking about... You guys are talking about how, you know, you think most of the population is religious. Most of the population... Okay, but we've seen plenty of videos where like, people don't even know... Like, if they show a picture of Jesus next to a picture of like, fucking Spiderman, they'll point out Spiderman, 100% of the time, and like, 70% or 60% of the time, they can figure out who Jesus is.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:27:32.402 --> 1:27:34.495]: 
  We're talking about... I'm boing-oing-oing!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:27:34.495 --> 1:27:35.575]:

  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:27:57.749 --> 1:28:02.676]: 
  Yeah, that's uh, that's that's confirmation bias though. That's more like people watching those videos

 SPEAKER_03 [1:28:02.018 --> 1:28:27.499]: 
  That's world bias. It's like, what was that? I'm just saying kids today, kids today, 10 years old and younger, do you think they believe that Spider-Man is more real than Jesus? Yes, yes! Okay, yes! They relate more. And also, this is where the world is going. What was that recent thing that they just released where it was like the McDonald's logo is more recognizable than the cross? Yeah, and Stanford.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:28:14.539 --> 1:28:16.767]: 
  Yeah! They relate more. And also, this is words for...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:28:26.217 --> 1:28:26.554]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:28:27.499 --> 1:28:32.444]: 
  This actually is a, this comes up to a topical event, because recently, uh...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:28:32.444 --> 1:29:03.713]: 
  Zayn left one direction and a lot of his fucking fans cut for Zayn cut for Zayn right now they all cut for Zayn they cut their wrists because this dude left one direction and fucking banned it's not gonna exist in six months and said be done and over with it's a blood sacrifice is what they're doing it's a they're more that's because Zayn is more recognizable to the fucking young population yeah Jesus Jesus more valid and I'm not saying that that's a bad thing you know Jesus is looking down just like shaking his head like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:28:37.337 --> 1:28:38.940]: 
  The pentruzain!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:28:55.950 --> 1:28:59.393]: 
  Jesus is more valid and I'm not saying that I'm not saying

 SPEAKER_02 [1:29:00.102 --> 1:29:01.941]: 
  You know Jesus is looking down.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:29:01.941 --> 1:29:02.599]: 
  I'm just like shit.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:29:04.506 --> 1:29:23.811]: 
  He's just so jealous that so many people are willing to cut themselves for some fucking kid that nobody fucking cares about in five years. But he shouldn't be, because it's all in his image. It's one direction to God. Yeah, but I thought that was very interesting when I saw it. Like, I know it was very sad that these fucking kids are cutting themselves, but like, it's actually the same thing as like people sacrificing themselves for Jesus. Jesus is fucking stupid.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:29:10.446 --> 1:29:12.083]: 
  But he shouldn't be because he's on his way.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:29:22.731 --> 1:29:24.790]: 
  He thinks he's fucking stupid, it's fine.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:29:24.705 --> 1:29:28.705]: 
  I know, but no, but it's like the human mentality is what it is like the horde mentality

 SPEAKER_02 [1:29:28.705 --> 1:29:32.940]: 
  reality of just trusting in someone so much or believing in someone so much that

 SPEAKER_03 [1:29:32.940 --> 1:30:21.085]: 
  Who the fuck came up with the idea to cut themselves because of it and started this shit train But that's a whole bunch of fucking little girls jumped on to fucking get attention on Twitter Who the fuck started me? That's my whatever that is they should have really cut for Zane and just fucking cut their own head off But me that is fucking stupid. But make this my point though This shit has been going on for eternity is pardon. It's in the human psyche to do that shit You know I mean like people fucking killed sheep for what you got why would God want to fucking sheep? What would you do if you got like so popular you were you were like the the sleepy cast Zane? Oh, and then you you were like you know what I'm gonna fucking move to New York I'm done with this shit and everyone was like cut for an aisle. Yeah, I would make a video I would absolutely make a video make a public appearance and I'd be like you know what any of you any of you cut your head off

 SPEAKER_01 [1:29:40.855 --> 1:29:41.564]: 
  But that's my-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:29:46.491 --> 1:29:48.330]:

What's something you're passionate about besides animation? For example, I love martial arts. How about you guys? Do you really know? I actually did karate one time when I was like... I did Taekwondo. I did Taekwondo, too. Taekwondo. I was in Yellow Belt. Dude, I was a fucking green belt. Mick, you are a second-degree Yellow Belt. I was a second-degree. I was a second-degree Yellow Belt. I was a second-degree Green Belt. You know what they do? They just give you a piece of electrical tape. You just read them all. Yeah. Dude, that's exactly what happened. I had two. Or they take a magic marker and drop shit on it. I was a red tag, which means I was a green belt, which is next to the black belt. Yeah, red electrical tape. It was the same. I had my electrical tape on my belt. When I signed up for Taekwondo originally, it was like an after-school experience where it was just fun, but then they started putting in grades. And at one point, they actually just took out Taekwondo altogether. And since it was only 45 minutes long... You know your story is really good right now, but we were all in Rec Center, Martial Arts. We have to stop that. He's not asking if we took Martial Arts. He's asking what your other passions are besides animation and stuff. I had a story to tie it on with it. Okay, go ahead. It was quick. It's almost over. But he moved in just... That's what she said. And our new teacher was all about fucking report cards and stuff. And since all I got was bad grades, I didn't want to show them. So I quit in the early... Greg, because I didn't want to show them my C, or I'd have to do like 50 push-ups and get kicked in the face by people who... Martial Arts.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:40:02.024 --> 1:40:03.441]: 
  Which means I don't have a red belt.
