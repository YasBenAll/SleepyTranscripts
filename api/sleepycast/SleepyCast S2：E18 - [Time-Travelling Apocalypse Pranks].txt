That was too far in my brain to know what the fuck you were talking about. I don't know. It's like a saying, nerds saying. You know, due to last week's episode, where we were over the line, completely over the line. What did we do? We had pressure from our advertisers. Now we have to turn it down to a G rating from now on. Oh, well, all we did was say racist meme. That was fun. Due to the FCC telling Chris that brown nose is not acceptable for a podcast. Brown nose. Yeah. I was saying brown nose. It's the whole time. Brown noses. Brown noses. That's what I was saying. Oh, that's all right then. Misunderstanding. They call old people.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:59.211 --> 0:04:50.477]: 
  Uh, Cory, do you find cool topics? Oh, I like the topic we were talking about with like stupid toys nobody would fucking ever buy. Like Scoob of Steve, nobody would buy that. No one would buy Mountain Climber Guy, and no one would buy anything that's like fucking like- Is anybody- any idea what any of this stuff means? Power drill, man. Just like, you know, when you go to a toy store, when you were little, we're gonna go on toys again. It's just an easy tangent. When you go to a toy store, and you would see these other fucking toys that like, you know, you need to make your collection of toys cool. So you have your like cool toys again, and then you have these other toys that are just from like, they're like the villains from like, Forgotten Disney films that nobody would ever play with. Here's the question. Like, let's play a game. Yeah. Name a recent popular movie that toys would have been made of that movie. Just name one. Well, like Transformers? Okay, let's just transform it. What's- what's the toy that would have sold the- What's the worst selling toy out of that movie? The fucking two black robots? Yeah. Or the one with the big ball? Who's that one Asian guy who drank the juice on the top of the- on top of the building?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:10.298 --> 0:04:11.580]: 
  Is anybody have any idea?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:30.379 --> 0:04:31.307]: 
  Here's a question.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:32.202 --> 0:04:32.707]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:37.028 --> 0:04:38.580]: 
  Well, like, Transformers? Okay, that's it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:46.444 --> 0:04:47.170]: 
  Who's that one?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:51.962 --> 0:05:17.241]: 
  Goofy guy with a weird comb over here. No, we would buy his fucking toy. I don't think any little boy would buy a Megan Fox Actually, yeah, they would yeah, they'd get horny on the worst toy in the Star Wars maybe the new one Yeah, fucking old yellow lady. Yeah, the nasty bug I bitch that nobody cares about the thing That was almost as bad looking as Jared Save call there guys You're a free pass Dude, chicken shit, that's what I think What you mean the girl?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:57.987 --> 0:05:00.366]: 
  It would be like really smart

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:01.919 --> 0:05:02.442]: 
  What's the word?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:02.442 --> 0:05:04.079]: 
  There's a toy in the Star Wars movie.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:04.990 --> 0:05:05.310]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:10.457 --> 0:05:14.322]: 
  thing that was almost as bad looking as Jared Derber. Safe call there guys.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:15.807 --> 0:05:16.667]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:18.135 --> 0:09:35.952]: 
  That's what you were talking about. I didn't say it. You were misogynistic. I was gonna say the Black Stormtrooper. Dude, everybody wants the Black Stormtrooper and the girl. Because then he can get them together and make them like fuck each other. Cory. That's true. That's terrible Cory. It's very true. I mean that's what you, when you had a girl and a boy toy, they knew each other. I was gonna say the Star Destroyer, but you know, it's not a racist like you guys. Fucking, you know that little round robot? He would be a bad toy because you could never stand up without you holding it. They built, they made him into a toy and it actually worked. He just stuffed animals. Well yeah, but that's a little electronic toy. He puts his thumb out and everything. Look, if I buy a toy of the little Black Stormtrooper and I buy a working robot, the robot scale will be like 10 times bigger than him. You know what blows my mind? It would be completely out of whack. If we're talking about like this kind of stuff, you know when you see like these gifts of these parents who make these like fucking costumes for these kids? Where like just amazing costumes. Like you like see someone who was wearing like an alien costume. The kid's like fucking standing like he's in a Street Fighter game and like an action pose. He shoots at his tongue and it actually like comes out with like a little tongue and stuff and goes back in. It's just like, how do you do this? We can talk about Halloween costumes in March on a mind. I'm gonna say that my favorite one is the one with this dude he built. He dressed up his little girl as the Ellen Ripley and the power loader and the aliens. He was the power loader and he just had her in like a harness on his chest. She looked like she was riding a big mac robot. Yeah, she was riding a robot and a robot. That's fucking awesome. I saw this like kid. It's just like this like five year old kid. He's like sucking on his thumb. Then his dad's like do the thing and he fucking like turns into like a little vehicle. Cause he's like a robot. Then he turns into like a fire truck and drives away and then gets up again. So it's like how the fuck does kids know to do that? Cause he just knew to like kind of turn into like this thing and look like a robot. They probably took a video of it and showed him how to do it. Get real tiring going to every single house and transforming for every single parent on the street. Yeah, your fucking parents turning into a... I got a Halloween costume story that haunted me for many years. Tell us. When I was a little boy there was a Halloween costume contest. And whoever had the scariest contest wins the grand prize of a bag of candy. And so my dad owns a store where he's so... Like every Halloween he'd sell the masks, right? I was like, dad, I need the scariest mask you've got. And he brought home this mask that was really scary, right? It was like all these faces but in one face. So, but it looked creepy and I was like, that's gonna win, right? So we went to the contest. There was all these kids who made their own costumes. Like this one girl wrapped herself up with like toilet paper. And another girl who got these like fake scars and like she just stuck them onto her face. So she looked like she was cut up pirate. Yeah. Right? And I was like, these stink. They're not even scary. They look crap, right? So, fucking... You're like stepping on people's feet. The moment of truth comes, right? They drag out a bunch of kids from the crowd because... And they put them all in a big long line of like 20 kids, right? And I was one of them and I was like, yes, I fucking won, right? And then she fucking... The girl with the fucking toilet paper won it. Yeah, yeah. Because she was creative. She made her own costume. Fucking bullshit. You can't expect those kinds of like kids things. They're completely unfair. I know what you're talking about though. They're saying, yeah, the scariest costume. Yeah, well that's not fucking scary. It's toilet paper. Yeah. Oh, she's... Like I get that she was creative and all that shit. She probably would have bawled her fucking hands out if she lost. And they would have been like, give her a consolation prize. Come on. All I'm saying is that I was the scariest. You should have, like... And if you're listening now, Contest Lady, fuck you. What costumes are gonna be really tired like overdone this coming year? Oh, Star Wars. Star Wars. There's fucking Kylo Ren boy. Okay. One punch man. Is it gonna be every day? Oh, yeah. One punch man. I think it's gonna be every day. Probably at Cosplay thing. Probably. Probably everywhere at Cosplay wise. Yeah. I can't really think, honestly. It'll be Star Wars this year. I mean, it's like nobody's gonna represent their boys, Batman and Superman. Nobody cares. Batman's always gonna be there. Batman will be there. But no one's gonna represent them together. I can see people being Batman. And maybe some fucking sad lose or something. Wonder, wonder, wonder women. There was that one year where every little girl was Elsa. Yeah. No, I mean everyone will be like Batman and Superman because their dads and their kids like it. But I think people might probably be Deadpool. There's gonna be a surge of Deadpool costumes. All those are not gonna work. All the eye holes are just, the eyes are gonna be white. They're just gonna be these terrible, they're gonna be wearing a ski mask. Oh, everyone's gonna be dressed up as hot dogs for whenever that one movie comes out. Wiener party. Wiener party comes out. Everyone really doesn't like that movie so far. It's a fucking trailer. The trailer showed the entire movie and people were like, I'm so excited for this fucking movie. It's like, it ruined it for you. Hot dogs this year.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:18.372 --> 0:05:20.144]: 
  That's what you're talking about. I didn't say it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:20.903 --> 0:05:23.704]: 
  You were misogynistic. I was gonna say the Black Storm Trooper. Dude, everybody was.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:28.530 --> 0:05:31.315]: 
  That's true. That's terrible.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:34.369 --> 0:05:35.196]: 
  I was gonna say the-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:37.255 --> 0:05:38.841]: 
  Not a resource like you guys.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:45.068 --> 0:05:45.912]: 
  He's a stuffed animal.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:47.245 --> 0:05:47.869]: 
  Yeah.

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:55.412 --> 0:05:57.235]:

  What do you do then?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:25.315 --> 0:06:27.492]: 
  Oh yeah, that was cool. He was the power loader.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:32.267 --> 0:06:33.465]: 
  As him.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:35.355 --> 0:06:36.537]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:05.292 --> 0:07:07.182]: 
  That haunted me for many years.

  You're like stepping on people's thumbs.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:03.460 --> 0:08:03.747]: 
  approximately

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:05.552 --> 0:08:07.071]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:24.503 --> 0:08:24.874]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:33.294 --> 0:08:35.438]:

  every single...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:34.990 --> 0:09:38.517]: 
  I don't see fuck I can't wait

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:37.487 --> 0:10:20.805]: 
  I don't want to go in a tangent about a movie, but it's like I've always felt and this isn't really a tangent about a movie But it's what I've always felt that what's his name fucking Seth Rogen is becoming the next like he's trying to become the next fucking like South Park boys like the next um, what's their name? Matt and Trey Yeah, he's really trying to be the net because with the interview that was supposed to be like Team America like oh look We're edgy with Team America style, but it sucked It had no it couldn't cool candlelight through that movie and then like um honestly all the movies you've written have done horrible They've all done bad except for this is the end, but he didn't even write half the movie really yeah It's the little tiny Jewish friend wrote it I thought that whole concept would have been like would have been really cool Or it's like the first big like adult kind of you know animated movie or whatever Yeah, but it's try hard all of the fucking dialogue was like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:51.561 --> 0:09:51.949]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:57.940 --> 0:09:58.210]: 
  So

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:10.394 --> 0:10:11.710]: 
  I thought that whole concept

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:16.975 --> 0:10:18.949]: 
  Yeah, but it's try hard.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:20.805 --> 0:10:24.467]: 
  The fuck man! Holy shit!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:23.505 --> 0:15:43.169]: 
  It's like that's really good Seth Rogen. It's like cool. Yeah, you've never said that Holy shit, yeah, everyone's gonna be dressed up as hot dogs Kylo Ren and Deadpool. Seth Rogen. Seth Rogen. I was gonna be like All the kids who couldn't even carry their blood to their babies Oh man, you know pineapple express is one of my favorite movies. That is a good movie But it's like the problem is it's like these writers They they get in this thing where they write so much movies and they write comedy movies that they forget how to write And I think Seth Rogen has fallen into that line where he's like his comedy is just borderline Inside jokes like all the stuff he releases like inside jokes sometimes like I really like super bad And I like you know pineapple express. Did he write that? Yeah, he wrote that. It's like ancient though And it's like I feel like the older he gets the less funnier he gets just every time I see him now He's still doing the same old like it's me. Oh my god. Yeah, it's like yeah, play someone else, please I'll say this why I respect the South Park guys way more than exactly well No, those guys one reason though those guys stay off social media. They never get into petty arguments online with they just hear Stopping yeah, I think he does really it's into arguments with people Seems like we're in Twitter is the weirdest shit I'm one guy who like he's like a guy you actually enjoyed it did like the two Irish sitcoms you actually enjoyed Oh, yeah, great lemon like a massive. He's a piece of shit He's like the most horrible person you'll ever see on Twitter.

  What are you gonna say?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:27.494 --> 0:22:27.797]: 
  Good morning.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:32.404 --> 0:23:06.205]: 
  They rejoiced. Cody, 2012! They rejoiced. Why didn't they upload that video? They paid good money for it. They threw like a paper in the air and like came to like, like, figure in Feddy. That's the only reason people donated money was to see all that unfold. I would have donated. I couldn't have watched that happen. Yeah, get your shit together. Next time, talk about monkey huts being smashed. We had drones with like, turrets also that came and like, scattered everything out. Picked off the monkeys when they were done. The monkey turrets about Boo drones. They saw that they were done with Coney so they fucking shot darts and then blew off their heads and looked at rockets that touched him as well.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:38.260 --> 0:22:43.137]: 
  I pay good money for them. They used to like to pay for the air and like pay me like $100. That's the only reason.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:45.685 --> 0:22:48.942]: 
  I would have donated if I could have watched that happen.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:46.444 --> 0:22:47.001]: 
  I woulda done it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:56.265 --> 0:22:59.252]: 
  Picked off the monkeys when they were done the monkey turret bamboo drones

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:06.930 --> 0:23:15.638]: 
  To hide the evidence, you make it seem like an American one. Oh, that's so funny. Isn't that what Coney did? He like captures kids and turns into worms. I don't even know anymore. Wormongers? He turns them into little drones.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:08.989 --> 0:23:09.344]: 
  Not that I love thatzie Not that I love thatzie Not that I love thatzie Looks good

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:11.993 --> 0:23:12.938]: 
  Well, even though

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:12.938 --> 0:23:14.423]: 
  know anymore. Warmonger returns the game.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:18.456 --> 0:25:30.992]: 
  He puts the kids in bamboo hats and they crank these bamboo levers and they fly around the air shooting darts at people. Tourists are walking, they shoot fucking poisonous darts and they lace the frog guts. They're like, help us Americans please donate. There's going to be a fucking wind of like a bola and fucking elephant flu coming in like a fucking tornado. It's going to fly over the ocean. Is elephant flu a thing or did you just make that up? What's it? Swine flu. Elephant flu. The Ebola and swine flu and syphilis is like a big spinning like tornado is going to fly over the water into a hurricane form with all these kids and they're like fucking torn propellers. You know in elementary school your teacher is like stop making shit up Corey. You know they're just constantly making shit up. Are you saying Corey that right now, Coney is creating a tornado of AIDS, syphilis and swine flu to shoot across the ocean to America? Using his weather machine. Yes. He's throwing all spinning a huge tornado with the kids inside. He created a weather machine using household bamboo appliances. He's fashioned himself a yes. That's exactly what I'm saying. That's good. I like that. No, they killed him. With bamboo. Are you sure he was killed? No, no one knows. People think he died before the documentary was even made. Yeah, he like it was just a big scam. The documentary was made because the thing is like the Coney 2012 it happened like in 2008 or 2009 that like Coney was relevant. Yeah, he was relevant. So he probably got like he probably did actually get ripped apart by an ape in the woods. It's just more than likely. Carelessly wasting all his bullets and got multed in. That's definitely what happened for a fucking jaguar. One of those things. It was a true ape. Do you be more scared of an ape or a chimpanzee? No, I was literally thinking about this earlier today. I think the chimps because I've seen a video is if you're calm, the apes don't bother you. You know, apes are fine. Apes will walk up to you and grab your foot and walk away. Yeah, they'll like pet you. But a chimpanzee wants to fuck. Like we wants to like challenge whatever. Apes like the big black looking chimpanzees? Apes are the carry black ones? You know what Tarzan? His dad is an ape. The gorillas. It's a silverback gorilla. Oh, gorillas. An ape is a class or a gorilla is a class of ape, right? It's a great ape. I suppose. I don't really know the official scientific classifications of monkeys. Pretty much an ape is a monkey that looks more human than the other monkeys.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:43.482 --> 0:23:47.127]: 
  Is the elephant flew a thing or did you just make that up? Isn't swine flew?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:47.802 --> 0:23:48.004]: 
  We'll see you next time.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:48.004 --> 0:23:48.612]: 
  That's what I'm saying.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:55.497 --> 0:23:56.054]: 
  Yeah, enjoy.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:57.269 --> 0:23:57.589]: 
  You know

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:02.635 --> 0:24:03.462]: 
  He's saying.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:11.376 --> 0:24:12.962]: 
  Using his weather machine, yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:31.913 --> 0:24:33.921]: 
  Yeah, he like it was just a big scan

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:40.131 --> 0:24:40.941]: 
  Good morning.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:40.941 --> 0:24:42.038]: 
  He was relevant.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:46.324 --> 0:24:48.180]: 
  That is more likely what I want.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:49.277 --> 0:24:50.948]: 
  That's definitely what happened.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:50.948 --> 0:24:51.100]: 
  Fuck it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:00.229 --> 0:25:00.938]: 
  I've seen a video that's

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:02.642 --> 0:25:03.604]: 
  You know apes are fine

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:05.342 --> 0:25:07.907]: 
  Yeah, they'll like pet you or like pick bugs at you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:10.337 --> 0:25:11.114]: 
  or apes like this.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:12.734 --> 0:25:14.354]: 
  Apes or... Is it the hairy black ones?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:16.075 --> 0:25:18.825]: 
  The gorillas. The silverback gorillas. Oh, gorillas. Silverback gorillas.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:22.082 --> 0:25:23.500]: 
  great eight. I suppose.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:23.500 --> 0:25:23.955]: 
  as it is.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:27.111 --> 0:25:27.668]: 
  Pretty much

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:31.954 --> 0:26:21.111]: 
  No! But what I'm saying is, okay, so if I saw a gorilla, I would go inside and look outside at it, and if he smashed through the door and went upstairs and closed the door. But if a monkey did that, or a chimpanzee did that, he'd keep slapping on the door until he got in and kill you. He'd rip off your fingers and your ears and your eyes. It's funny, the two worst, like the two smartest animals, like chimps and dolphins. And elephants. And they're like the worst. Elephants. They're horrible. They're monsters. Elephants, I wouldn't count those two. Like dolphins, they should be dolphins or monkeys or something. But they're just really horny and angry and mean and violent. And apes are just really horny, angry and mean. Gorillas just sit there chilling out all day. They're just like, ehh. Do you think if you threw a rock at a gorilla, he would even fish? He would kill you. He would run over to you and grab you by the hair and throw you over the woods. What if I was flying?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:47.226 --> 0:25:47.462]: 
  It's

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:51.614 --> 0:25:51.715]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:53.487 --> 0:25:54.195]: 
  in elephants.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:55.124 --> 0:25:57.132]: 
  Yeah, they're horrible. They're monsters.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:58.667 --> 0:25:59.241]: 
  like over, over, over and over again.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:01.401 --> 0:26:03.848]: 
  Dolphins are just horny, but they're just really horny

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:06.362 --> 0:26:06.514]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:09.417 --> 0:26:09.957]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:14.969 --> 0:26:17.449]: 
  He would kill you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:17.449 --> 0:26:18.192]: 
  run over to you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:19.964 --> 0:26:20.132]: 
  have to drag one out of every one is just there that has.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:23.423 --> 0:30:52.984]: 
  When I was in my fucking bamboo drone fucking throwing rocks at him, what would he do then? He fucking took a big stick and fucking fell in it. He fucking made a big shot. He shot bamboo like catapult and fire himself at you. Yeah, no, yeah, you take a big stick and like stick it up in my fucking propellers, stop me and fall down, break my arm and then he fucking smashed me. There's always, you see a lot of videos of people going to see the silverbacks in the woods and they're like, the silverbacks are like, what the fuck? And they'll just walk over and like drag you for a bit and then let you go and walk away. They just don't care, they're just nice. That's because to you they're like, this guy's a pussy. Pretty much. He's a little weakly. Exactly. I think as long as you're not threatening to their children or something, they usually don't care. Do you think if you dressed up in Aplos, like you had like one of those monkey costumes, you went over and just started like, munking around just like hanging out? You think you did that? I mean, you know, they did that in what's called Wild Boys. Boys really? Yeah, I think, yeah, they dressed up as gorillas and were like fucking with the gorillas. Do they actually like? Yeah, I think so. Oh no, they dressed up as bananas. Those boys. Yeah, big huge bananas. Oh, I mean, I used to love Steve-O and Chris Ponches. I know. I would love to have Chris Ponches on the podcast. They're all dead now. What's the other one? What's the other one that's he's in rehab now or something? Oh my god, did you see Steve-O's like documentary? That's like the saddest thing. I really like Steve-O. I like him too, but man, his documentary is like, you want to see an oppressing like drug story of someone who just like has no idea what they're doing with their life at one point. That whole crew, man, what a mess. Johnny Knox, I don't know if he escaped. What? I like Johnny Knox. No, no, he seems all right, but I don't even know what happened to him. But he's like, he's like the only one that got out without falling into a drug fuel. Because he has a good face for like movies. Like he has a good like action face. Johnny Knoxville, but our fucking Chris Ponches and Steve-O are my favorites. The rest of them just had all these millions just blow on drugs. I don't like that guy. He takes his shits on everything. The one who died anyway. Oh yeah, I'm not a fan of that guy. The one who died. Oh, I loved him. I really liked him. He was my favorite, Ryan Dunn. Until he got drunk and drove down the road 150 miles an hour with his friend in the car. The problem is like he always, he got some pretty, the bulk of a lot of shit because he was the one who could like handle like some of the worst stuff. But that was just because like, Bam was too much of a push over to do anything. So he would just end up doing it. He would always try to fuck with him. And I feel like they have never got anything. If you guys got a few million dollars each, what would you, would you start just doing drugs and partying? No, no, definitely not. I've had fucking opportunities to do drugs. I've done it. I've done it. Drugs suck. I've had the opportunity to be a part of that sort of crowd. I don't like that whole like life. It's a toxic lifestyle because it's like your friends all do it. And the next morning they go out and do the exact same thing and nothing changes. It's really, yeah. Like I've seen people just get like pulled into it and their life turns to shit. It's a scary, the scariest thing is whenever you don't know how you act around other people. Like I had one friend or they're not really my friend. I just sort of went over to their house and like did drugs in their house. Drugs was like the most mild form of drug, but we did that. And they were tweakers. I don't think they knew that though because you're not aware that you're a tweaker. They're really paranoid and shit. When someone is like tweaks from doing drugs, they like their faces twitch and they start like doing really creepy like, you know, like tweakers, like they twitch and they do stuff like that. Yeah. Well, that's what they were doing. They didn't realize it because your body can't tell. That sucks. Yeah. So you can't tell if you're freaking out whenever you do drugs. I had a million dollars. I just fucking save it until something came up. Yeah. If I had a million dollars, I just save it to them because then I give it to the people who they needed it. Oh, expend it. What would you spend it on? Stuff. Boats. Boats. Lots of boats. I'd buy seven or eight large boats. Would you buy a boat and then spend the remainder $500,000 on a huge pee hat to put on your boat? Yes. Cool. It's a good investment. I would paint every boat in like a color scheme based on one of you guys and put your face on the front. They have boat races. Cool. It's a good idea. It's a good way to waste money. Can we push a boat and shoot water out of our mouths at the other boats? Yeah, like the USS Spazkid versus like the... You know when people name boats? Is that like an official like thing to do or do people just call their boats something and say that's the name of it? Or is there like a registration system that you got to go through? I mean, I, well, I mean, I guess it's both. They can call it whatever, but they guess they have to register. They probably have to, I don't know. I don't actually know. Why am I even on the boat naming authority on the podcast? Boats have like salt in their name, like salty, like just dirty, like all these names. Like the salty clam, salty bum bum. Yeah, just these awful names. Yeah, I don't know. They're all, they're weird. Boat names are the weirdest thing. What would you call your boat for real? Yeah. Yeah, that's a good one. I'd call mine the or LLY or LLY fast boat. Call mine Mr. Hansen. Mine, mine would be called, I don't know. It'd be something that I would just like slap the keyboard and stick like tape on the thing. It'd be like a foggy spsss.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:29.987 --> 0:26:31.135]: 
  No you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:33.615 --> 0:26:33.987]: 
  Yeah, no.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:52.650 --> 0:26:52.904]: 
  That's what I'm talking about.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:54.912 --> 0:26:56.954]: 
  Pretty much. He's a little weakly. Exactly.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:59.991 --> 0:27:01.139]: 
  Usually don't care.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:05.813 --> 0:27:06.539]: 
  Monkeying around.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:07.770 --> 0:27:08.496]: 
  We know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:08.496 --> 0:27:08.597]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:14.909 --> 0:27:16.360]: 
  Do they actually like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:21.490 --> 0:27:21.608]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:28.004 --> 0:27:28.324]: 
  they're all

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:29.421 --> 0:27:30.467]: 
  No, no, no.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:33.555 --> 0:27:35.547]: 
  Oh my god, did you see?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:37.909 --> 0:27:40.086]: 
  Yeah, I really like Steve-o.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:43.579 --> 0:27:44.085]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:46.735 --> 0:27:47.089]: 
  Oh

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:49.334 --> 0:27:49.907]: 
  It's pretty.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:50.616 --> 0:27:54.497]: 
  What? I like Johnny Knox. No, no, he seems all right, but I don't know what happened to him.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:56.826 --> 0:27:59.779]: 
  falling into a drugs, drug feud.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:02.817 --> 0:28:03.441]: 
  Johnny Knox

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:06.917 --> 0:28:07.440]: 
  The rest of them.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:09.246 --> 0:28:10.309]: 
  I don't like that guy, he takes-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:11.710 --> 0:28:14.190]: 
  The one you didn't wear. Oh yeah, I'm not a fan of that guy. The shit's everywhere.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:15.659 --> 0:28:20.502]: 
  I love it. I really liked it. It was my favorite Ryan until he got drunk and drove down

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:21.919 --> 0:28:23.792]: 
  Yeah, he was with his friend in the car.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:29.834 --> 0:28:30.323]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:36.246 --> 0:28:37.815]: 
  I feel like they have never got anything.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:41.933 --> 0:28:43.350]: 
  He's dead. No, he definitely is.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:45.173 --> 0:28]: 
  I've done it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28 --> 0:28:47.249]: 
  Drugs suck.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:49.071 --> 0:28:50.944]: 
  I don't like that whole, like, lifestyle.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:50.944 --> 0:28:51.164]: 
  It's

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:57.019 --> 0:28:57.323]: 
  really

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:00.934 --> 0:29:01.508]: 
  The scariest thing

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:01.508 --> 0:29:01.744]: 
  point.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:04.613 --> 0:29:05.136]:

  Thank you very much.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:40.101 --> 0:29:41.451]: 
  I'll expand it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:46.547 --> 0:29:48.741]: 
  Would you buy a boat and then spend the remainder

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:53.432 --> 0:29:53.483]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:53.483 --> 0:29:53.955]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:39.407 --> 0:35:08.117]: 
  Some things just seem like too much of a burden to even if you add the money to own a boat There's boat repairs. There's what if the boat breaks down and then fucking middle the ocean is duct tape boat fuel boat insurance You have costs are out of out of here. I would never bother Why don't they just stick like a Flotation inside the middle of the boat that you put like one of those floating boats that are always floating So you put it inside the boat so in case it crashes you have a boat that floats You'd have to seal you have to have a permanent level a sealed bag around the entire inside of the boat Why don't you just have like a big opening under the boat you can stick like floating devices underneath? Then the wouldn't really be a boat anymore. It'd be a raft It would go two miles an hour if you were seeing those pictures of Like people have like flats under the ocean kind of where like just people at the bottom of the bottom But there's their underwater to a point where they have like glass walls all around them So in their bedroom, they're just looking into the ocean pretty much I used to have that with my own no, I swear to God My I remember when I was staying on my grandma There was like this thing at the edge of like a lake and it was like a really I just remember being super fucking awesome when I was little because it was like almost being on a pirate ship And it was like a boat at the it was like because my she did it an artist And he always bought like these weird art houses and that was like an art house and it was like this house It was like half of a boat that was underwater right that was sticking out So it's like a living boat that was like built basically like around the thing with like you'd walk at the edge of like What do you call those things that like on the river bay where you like walk at the edge of them a jetty a Jedi a Jedi It's like where boats are like placed against there's like a name for it. It's like a really simple doc Yeah, a doc you walk at the end of the dock and that's where the door is you go inside of it And you'd walk down the stairs and we'd have those like Yeah, poor hole windows that you could like see fish and shit swimming underneath while you're underwater But that's also scary because what happens if it cracks and now you have fucking water pouring in your yeah If you're like a multi-millionaire I'm gonna build a house and it's gonna be partially under the water and I'm just my whole bedroom is gonna be a glass wall That's what I'm saying. It just seems like scary. You're setting yourself up for disaster Yeah, you're gonna spring a leak your whole house is gonna be around Not just that right? Okay, one you can spring a leak to You know the actual pressure could just kill you one night all the water could just smash the top of you Yeah Another thing that would concern me is that you're underwater and you're like you fucking your girlfriend in your cool like glass room looking at All the fishies yes, and then a scuba diver starts knocking on the window always always a real concern. Yeah So what if there's like a submarine or something? Tom scuba diver It's a GoPro on his pet dolphin. He says over there. I'd be really scared of that I like I wouldn't want would you jack off and there's a bunch of like fish looking at you Yes, I wouldn't cuz some fish are intelligent Dolphin would look in and see you jacking off. You're gonna reserve this information The dolphins are ramming With its fucking corks Jack me up On the action just use dolphin boner like on by just looking at you as one eye You've seen the way the turtle gets a boner. No, um their dicks are longer than they are It's like doesn't come out of their head port. No, it comes out of their little dickhole I don't want to know about animal dicks. You sure their head doesn't go back I really don't a dick comes out I saw a picture of like a horse stick and an elephant dick, and I'm like it's terrifying. It's not it's cool It's not cool. You can put your arm inside of an elephant stick No, are you sure that it's not just like their head goes there? They're weapons They could kill a human if I were to see a big elephant dick next to me I probably just leave because it would smell really bad. Would you motorboat?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:42.207 --> 0:33:43.236]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:45.134 --> 0:34:45.944]: 
  I really don't.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:50.534 --> 0:34:56.119]: 
  It's not cool. It's not cool. You can put your arm inside of an elephant's day. Are you sure? Good to know.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:58.937 --> 0:35]: 
  of what their- their weapon is.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35 --> 0:35:01.469]: 
  It happens.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:09.265 --> 0:38:28.727]: 
  An elephant stick. An elephant's pee hole? Do elephants like, I've never seen it, okay, I've seen an elephant stick before, but I've never seen an elephant's balls. I mean, I've never seen an elephant stick. I never actively went, I mean, I've seen it in porn, but that's just fake. Oh, are you so afraid you got fingered? That was an elephant stick. Yeah, I thought that was a horse. I thought that was a horse. What? You brought, you brought it up. There's an offhand comment, let's just do this. He's in that bad conversation. He's in the video of the hyena shibbing his head up the elephant's ass. Oh yeah, and then the thing like shits on its head or something. He like, he like pulls out the inside of the elephant's ass trying to eat it and then it just explodes. A dead elephant. It just explodes water all over him when he runs away. Yeah, he puts his head up a rotting elephant's ass. And it just busts the inside like a balloon. It's funny. He's hungry. It's like the most like, unknowable way. I mean, the elephant has a tough hide. He's like, oh, this is the softest way in, I guess. Pretty much. They don't give a, they don't know, they're dumb. They're dumb wild dog animals. Terrible topics this week. We've talked about everything. Now we have like, literally probably 60 hours of talking, plus 200 plus hours of us being edited out. Yeah, that's true. How many fucking topics can you get, honestly? Like, you know, it's funny. That's something, we could, that's a topic. What about these people who, who are able to just like continuously talk every day? Like, they always have something to talk about. I mean, every five hour radio show, every day for three years. Well, all they talk about is the topics of the day. Oh yeah, they talk about current stuff. When we try to talk about shit, usually it's us trying to talk about something that can be timely. I mean, yeah, we can talk about current topics and the stuff we've heard. We avoid politics, sports, daily, daily occurrences, celebrity news. So we knock out like all like the hot topics and we go straight for like the toys. What's Kim Kardashian up to this week, guys? So I want to know. Kim Kardashian is such a fucking enigma to me. I never watch anything or see anything she does and yet she still comes up. I keep hearing she's so weird. She's only famous because of porn. She's only famous because of what's his name, fucking Kanye. Kanye, do you guys ever feel out of touch, out of touch with what's popular? I'm glad I'm out of touch. I'm completely out of touch. I always have been. Every time I go to Twitter and I see something trending, I don't know what it is. I click on it. It's always like some rap album or something. Yeah, something fucking stupid. I'm like going on through my emails and they're like, hey, you should follow fucking Kim Kardashian and fucking Hillary Clinton. I'm not gonna follow them on Twitter. That kind of shit like trains you to know what kind of shit it is in future. So if you go on Twitter and you see this topic that everyone's talking about, I would say 99% of the time now I can say with 100% certainty that no one's gonna be talking about it ever again in a week's time. Yeah, these things that happen where people like if a huge thing happens, it's the talk of the town for like two days and then nobody cares after the third day. People's attention spans aren't that long anymore. Things don't last because things just grow out of importance. The more crazy shit that happens, the less you care about the next crazy thing that happens. Exactly. Because it's just like, cool, cool. And when something happens out of like a blue moon, you're just like, oh. I didn't think anyone would ever tell that whole Bash reverse thing, but everyone's just forgotten about it after a week. Yeah, no one cares. He's like, weird guy. Is he back to being epic? Yeah, no one cares about it anymore. No one cares. It's like, sweet dude, more Let's Play is sweet. Yeah, he's back to making videos and like, it's like, there will always be like the subset of people who still remember, but for the most part, no one cares. He was like 10 seconds from putting a bolt in his head or something, right? And now he's just back to playing Minecraft. I think the good old days, joining the Oxcast as they sing songs about digging holes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:11.374 --> 0:35:11.948]: 
  Do elephants?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:12.944 --> 0:35:13.720]: 
  Okay, I've seen an elephant.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:15.745 --> 0:35:16.572]: 
  I've never seen...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:20.436 --> 0:35:20.875]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:28.662 --> 0:36:30.349]: 
  Oh yeah, they talk about current stuff.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:32.897 --> 0:36:34.028]: 
  I mean, yeah, we can talk about it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:35.749 --> 0:36:36.036]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:09.972 --> 0:37:10.242]: 
  Mm-hmm.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:12.959 --> 0:37:15.338]: 
  Yeah, something fucking stupid. I'm like going on.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:18.747 --> 0:37:19.422]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:21.505 --> 0:38:23.631]: 
  back to being back to being

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:29.571 --> 0:41:40.697]: 
  See, I'm lost again. I don't want to know. I don't want to know. These are all just like quick inside jokes that are always- You know what, Na'Lois gives me shit. Slight stabs. I'm completely out of touch with music. Like, you guys hear music because of Tom, but I'm pretty sure if Tom wasn't around, you guys would also be oblivious to the music. Oh, what am I not hearing? They tell you a lot of whack, whack, whack, whack, whack, whack, whack. I want to be a little Rihanna on the radio. Oh no! See, that's just all shit that's like, it's out of date after a year and then no one ever like sings it or talks about it again. I'm gonna miss out on Rihanna and other like failure artists that make awful music. The-the-the R&B music scene is the most bizarre thing. It's-it's dribble. It's like these people with auto-tune sounds like, Yeah, hey-ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's like so-and-so. It's on the radio. It's like so-and-so featuring so-and-so. It's like, yeah, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da. There's like, do-do-do-do-do-do. Da-da-da-da. Da-da-da-da. It's just like, the move was like, that like beat that's like, ah, ball, I can't- I can't- It's so processed. It's just- Like, have you ever listened to- like, I know it's gonna sound really gay. Yeah. Have you ever like listened to Japanese like-pop music? No. Well, I- Like, I don't listen to it, but I've heard it. Like, really, like, you'll never- you'll never hear anything like it. So, every time their pop music comes out, all this like music is really different. It's compared to the American- It's insane. Like, calculated like, four chord song that's constantly put out. It's insane. You hear these J-pop songs and like, every one of them are hit. They're like, individual songs that are hit. It's cause- And then you hear- Like, they're all so unique and you've never heard anything like each one before. It's weird. Yeah, and then you hear an America song. It's like, I'm so awesome. It's always- Every American song is- I'm awesome. It's like, the worst shit ever. It's like, I'm tired of it. It's like, it's funny too because like, I would like to think of myself as someone who enjoys rap, and I do enjoy hip-hop, but I enjoy old rap and old hip-hop. All this garbage- It was catchy. It was catchy back in the day. Yeah. Now it's just this- Now it's just like noise. It's so- it's not only- Not only noise- it's nails on charcoal or noise. It is terrible. I can't- You can chalk it up to the same thing. If you want an example of music nowadays, just listen to Rihanna's work song. That's your fucking- I feel like even saying this, you know, I'm like, am I just- am I completely out of touch with this? I don't care. But it just- it just so makes me angry, listening to it. It's not even like an earworm. It's like an unfair earworm. It's like, it's like- it's like, if you repeat a word in somebody's ear long enough, they're gonna fucking remember it. Dude, if you like, wired my eyelids open and like, the clockwork or R and just start- just put on the local R&B radio station. I- I would crack. I would crack in a few minutes. You would start singing along. I would say anything. Because there would be two songs playing. Like, that's it. Just those two songs. Like, now back to Rihanna work! Yeah, the Rihanna, the Rihanna, then the DJ. It's like, what's up y'all? Coming back to you to like 98.6, the Black and Jazz channel, whatever, you know, I don't know. You know, come on, the new- the new hits on Rihanna with- Work, good work. Work, work and work. That's the one that's still on screen. The hits on work and work featuring DJ Jazzy, Jeff, whatever. Whatever me and Y'all go to Subway, it's always like the same three songs on repeat over and over. I'm tired of it. I'm so tired of these fucking songs. Holy shit, I just want to like, reset. Just like, turn the button off, start over again. On society? Just reset society? Just reset music? Let's go back to fucking sticks and stones with people going, like-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:32.963 --> 0:38:33.199]: 
  These are

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:34.634 --> 0:38:37.452]: 
  You know what, Nile always gives me shit. Slight stabs.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:39.207 --> 0:38:39.629]: 
  you guys here.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:40.894 --> 0:38:41.350]: 
  Well, I'm pretty sure.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:43.290 --> 0:38:44.387]: 
  Oh, what, I'm not here.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:47.594 --> 0:38:49.365]: 
  Oh my god. Oh no!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:54.580 --> 0:38:55.626]: 
  I'm gonna miss out on

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:02.680 --> 0:39:04.249]: 
  It's dribble. It's like these people

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:07.540 --> 0:39:09.615]: 
  Yeah, it's like so and so.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:22.896 --> 0:39:23.149]: 
  It's

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:31.249 --> 0:39:32.734]: 
  No. Well, I- Yes, the guy-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:34.084 --> 0:39:34.709]: 
  And it's like,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:36.869 --> 0:39:37.274]: 
  You'll never.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:42.876 --> 0:39:44.445]: 
  compared to the American like calculated...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:44.445 --> 0:39:44.766]: 
  See you next time.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:46.504 --> 0:39:46.673]: 
  It's

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:51.060 --> 0:39:52.140]: 
  It's because then you're all

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:54.773 --> 0:39:55.127]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:58.502 --> 0:39:59.447]: 
  It's always

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:59.447 --> 0:40:02.502]: 
  Every American song

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:02.502 --> 0:40:03.227]: 
  Whatever.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:13.015 --> 0:40:15.833]: 
  It was catchy. It was catchy back in the day.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:18.786 --> 0:40:19.343]: 
  That would be.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:21.486 --> 0:40:22.769]: 
  It is terrible.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:28.725 --> 0:40:29.114]: 
  I feel like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:33.214 --> 0:40:34.277]: 
  I don't care.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:43.170 --> 0:40:44.740]: 
  enough they're gonna fucking remember

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:00.231 --> 0:41:02.796]: 
  Yeah, they ran and then they...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:09.411 --> 0:41:10.947]: 
  I know.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:16.549 --> 0:41:18.017]: 
  That's the only thing.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:18.996 --> 0:41:20.498]: 
  Whatever me now

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:21.544 --> 0:41:21.561]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:22.185 --> 0:41:22.725]: 
  Whatever.

  over and over and over.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:27.501 --> 0:41:27.974]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:35.517 --> 0:41:37.457]: 
  Reset the side eight with a bomb.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:41.541 --> 0:41:54.940]:

  30,000 BC

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:59.007 --> 0:44:30.240]: 
  That's a good idea for a topic right so if you were to go back in time right and bring back a TV and a radio Right, and if you were to show like let's say either like medieval times or a caveman One piece of media just to see how much it would fuck up the future completely What would what wouldn't would it be so like let's say if you brought back fucking poker face and just show it to a bunch of cavemen they're going Society's like based on that song because everyone was singing it Everybody's They don't even have to see like Lady Gaga so like if you brought back a radio with poker face And you went from town to town in medieval times showing like a vast majority of society and you came to the future Like everything would be completely different. I go to the evil time and give them a vibrator See what they do see if they think it's a weapon. I'm like this is a weapon from the future Bring back mr. Rogers and bot now I'd bring back mr. Rogers Then those cave paintings like a stick figure at the blue sweater on Like different shoes and like day like one with different shoes on then Bob Ross would just be this stick figure at this big circle I think it's like something like you think he's like the king. Yeah So we're talking about stuff bringing them back to medieval times. This is like kidding King Arthur's court So let's just say right Corey. So instead of giving him a stinky baseball bat baseball I can give him something cool just imagine it right Corey you have the power to Teleport a huge stadium back thousands of years, right? So that it's pretty much like a huge woods woodstock, right? You've got your big stadium huge-ass speakers, right? And then people like what is this and they all start gathering around just like millions of people around you, right? You've got your one chance a big projector or you can play music one song or one piece of media Well, I wouldn't play music What would you do because I would have a bad future because I'd be playing like somebody I'd give him a sharper image catalog Blow their minds protect anything up on the screen and they'll all Holographic clock thing that takes back and forth and definitely can I project gay brothers? They'll all run up on stage and kill you Just like this guy You gotta think of it from their perspective too, so they're all looking up on on the big screen They're like what is this huge portal? I'm looking at like they don't realize this is great They think there's two giant gay brothers sitting there

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:59.985 --> 0:42:01.943]:

I think they're like terrifying monsters is what happens when you get captured, they fuck you together. So they have like these like things like they like made a like they like were able to create these like mountains of like a gay brother sitting on his bed holding his gay. Yeah, Matt Rushmore is just two gay brothers fucking each other. By the way, Fred, no one doesn't know gay brothers is a stupid word. They're gonna earth this thing like from Lord of the Rings like this gigantic stone sculpture of like these two fucking gay dudes. It's gonna be like 25 feet tall. What is this? It's like even if you look. Next to Stonehenge. Society's based off of that thing now. Yeah, I mean. It's like the new Jesus Christ.

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:36.996 --> 0:48:19.994]: 
  Is that an actual thing? Is that like a thing? It's like these girls dancing to a fucking anime song behind bad greens. These two girls in high school trying to get people to join anime clubs. They're like dancing in front of a shitty green screen. You can show them that or foam adventures. Foam adventures! Foam adventures! Isn't that a video where you get like 1% thumbs up or something? It's kind of like, I guess like, just a ridiculous amount of... Foam! We got foam! Everyone in the future would just be fucking obnoxious for screaming that over and over. Everybody would have to have foam or they would be fucking... Crucify. The access would be made out of foam. Jeff, you still gotta answer. I'm thinking! Either foam adventures or anime club. Now you have to choose.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:38.009 --> 0:47:41.940]: 
  Is that an actual thing or is that like- It's a strange video.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:41.940 --> 0:47:42.987]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:37.965 --> 0:48:52.309]: 
  Dude, they were thinking he was a god because he was in this green room. This like bright green room with this like... Bashers and new cheese. So you have a picture of Bash around these like really different faces. Would it like teeth clashed and look it up in the air?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:48.782 --> 0:48:50.790]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:57.996 --> 0:49:26.549]: 
  You walk into a room and the statue of Bachelors are screaming at you when you walk in. There's a green room. They don't have any greens, so they just put tape grass everywhere with mud and shit. I would show them the Goldfish video. That's what I'm showing. Oh really? Which Goldfish video? It was something we talked about in episode one or something. It was this porn video, but it was this woman pinching Goldfish to death and putting him in a blender and food processor and dumping him in her latex suit. And they would just make their brains melt.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:58.232 --> 0:48:58.789]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:10.264 --> 0:49:10.905]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:59.742 --> 0:50:00.096]: 
  night.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:03.134 --> 0:50:04.163]: 
  No cans, cork.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:15.081 --> 0:50:25.139]: 
  Like he loves it for an hour and it dies. No! He fucking smits it. He fucking fucks it against a rock and then cries and kills himself. No more batteries for 10,000 years.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:21.510 --> 0:50:21.949]: 
  You're wrong.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:21.949 --> 0:50:23.181]: 
  and cries comes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:26.607 --> 0:51:26.327]: 
  So you would just use your fucking time-traveling powers to fuck with one caveman? Did you ever see that movie by the way? 10,000 BC? No. Oh my god. They pitched it as almost like a- I'm not historical, but it's sort of a- The trailers were like semi-realistic of like, oh this is an adventure taking place in 10,000 BC But then you watch it and it turns into this like Lord of the Rings fantasy movie halfway through. That stinks. I remember seeing that movies trailer and I said that looks bad. And it's from that guy who makes all those other shitty movies. Yeah, he needs world destruction in every movie he makes. That's the independence guy right? Rowan Emery? Yeah, yeah, he's not very good. H.J. Rowan? H.J. Rowan, that's J.K. Rowling. Who is that? Writer of Harry Potter. Really? You dig back. If you could change like literally anything in history, like any tiny detail, what would you do? Make the moon purple. That won't change much. Change the his change. If you could literally change anything, you could be like, I want Hitler's last name to be Bram Boy. Spittler.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:49.371 --> 0:50:50.249]: 
  I remember seeing that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:57.994 --> 0:51:02.483]: 
  That's the independence guy, right? Roland Emery? Yeah, yeah, he's not very good. Extreme.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:18.649 --> 0:51:20.961]: 
  No, uh, change the hitch. Change.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:28.454 --> 0:52:48.694]: 
  People spit on him till he kills himself. He's a good old spitler. He just fails and everything he gets is last name. You can change literally. You can make Hitler's nose twice as big. I'd give him a normal mustache and then see if the Hitler mustache actually takes off anywhere in the world after that. But then everyone won't have normal mustache. The hipsters would fucking bring back the Hitler mustache. They would like realize it shaving off half your mustache makes you look like a kid. I'd be curious. It's a little like you can't play this game where you just make things, you change things just to see what happens. It's a good idea for a game in general. Just going back in time giving somebody a game boy and then going into the future and seeing what happens. What if the first two shuttles in a row blew up trying to go into space and they just give up? Or they'd make something complete and be retired. They'd make a new law saying you can't do this anymore. It's too dangerous. How many disasters in a row would you need to outlaw space? I'd say five. The funny part is you could just do something where you could have dry ice in a Petri dish and put it on the ground and people would go out and touch it and fucking leave. Dry ice. They were trying to touch it because they don't know what it is. They were like they get cursed so people would be terrified of it and just be sitting there. What you brought back in time that plays in but that doesn't stick together when you take it out of water? It's below their fucking mind. Yeah exactly. Give them easy baked ovens. Give them those little animal things that you make in water by putting it in water and turning it into an animal.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:28.943 --> 0:51:31.440]: 
  We'll spit on him till he kills himself.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:31.440 --> 0:51:32.369]: 
  or

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:35.254 --> 0:51:36.064]: 
  Last name.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:44.350 --> 0:51:47.961]: 
  But then everyone won't have normal mustache anymore

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:57.175 --> 0:51:57.495]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:02.069 --> 0:52:03.064]: 
  Like what if the

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:08.970 --> 0:52:10.506]: 
  I bet they've been making new...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:17.965 --> 0:52:18.825]: 
  Foi por isso.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:32.579 --> 0:52:32.865]: 
  I love it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:33.743 --> 0:52:34.131]: 
  What you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:40.628 --> 0:52:40.898]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:49.960 --> 0:52:57.807]: 
  Oh man, I haven't seen one of those in ever. You could fucking entertain, you could go back in time with the yo-yo that lights up and be like BOOM! They disappear, they'd be like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:59.460 --> 0:57:18.019]: 
  I'd say you'd be killed within two seconds. They'd just be completely horrified. They'd be, they'd love it. It would be like the first time they ever saw two different kinds of colors. Imagine if you went back there just the toy lightsaber, you'd be rolling over a country by next week. You go there and it's like, whoosh, like 240p quality noises while you're fucking hitting stuff with a glow stick. You'd be like, I'm the new king, and then you fucking like, whoosh, they put it out, they're like, they're all bow. How fast do you think society would fall if all the ocean in the world got turned into like, phantom orange? Pretty fast, pretty quickly. Think the world could be saved if that happened? You just like, God, can you do me a favor with earth? Can you turn it into a soda? If the whole world, if all the water turned to coke, like you'd be fairly fucked. Oh boy, oh my god dude. Like how long could you live for? Not long at all. Society would like crumble. Well, the fresh water might still be out. I mean, if it's only the, are you talking about all the water or just the salt? All the ocean. That still like makes it pretty cool. I mean, you'd probably still be able to live off fresh water for a long time, but all seafood would be dead. All the fish would be dead, so that would be like, really. Nothing left alive. So like, the seafood at like, Japan and stuff, they would be completely fucked. Wait, it would be worse than that, right? So all the plankton would be dead, so all the fish would be dead, but don't plankton each shit. Well, the entire ocean ecosystem would be destroyed. There would be just like, floating. Any birds that ate fish would die off. Any people who went to coastal city would probably starve. I would say the world would last two weeks. All like, these like weird like fish that nobody's seen before with human faces would float up to the top of the water, and everyone would see all these like scary like, they see like fucking crackings floating above the oily water. That's a good question. Do we, do we need the oceans? Like if the oceans just turned to acid, would we need them? Completely. Yeah. Yeah, completely. They make up a good percentage of the water. Not only would uh, fish all day, all these like boats would fucking corrode and sink. No, I'm saying if, if the oceans were no longer usable, could you just survive off, you know, land, animals and fresh water? I think you could for all two. You could, but would there not be like, you know, everyone would be freaking out and like running inland, like killing each other, trying to like, survive. Also the fish would all rot because they would fucking be, they would just be like, this smell. Well, there'd probably be a terrible smell for a while. Yeah. That would never really. I mean, it would smell good and then really bad. Outside, you would smell good inside. If you were in Iowa, like you wouldn't smell it though, really. You'd just all be congregating around Iowa the second you leave out of this, just this horrible smell. That sounds like a nightmare. Well, what do you think would happen if the sky turned brown for the rest of our ages? So what you're telling me is God, when he was creating water, if he'd put a dab of cherry cola inside of it. He went into the future and he tasted it. That's pretty good. I'll let my humans, I'll do the masala in here. He's like, hmm, this is good. We'll put it all over earth. As he's an asshole, he does it like, how he does chicken wings, he puts too much fucking sauce on it and ruins it. What if the ocean turned to chicken wings? It never went bad. I mean, people would have food forever because like, the ocean's big. It's a big thing. It's a lot of chicken wings. People would just get so tired of chicken, chicken wings. Yeah, but if there's no ocean, what happens with your poopy? It all piles up online. What if the water turns into poop? You're talking about your poopy. If you're living in Iowa and you're surrounded by fields, take one shit, right? There will be one shit in your field now, but then the next day, there'll be two. It breaks down. Yeah, but it's like fertilizer. Mix it with the dirt and it'll... I know, but eventually you'll just have a really disgusting land around you. Especially if you've got lots of neighbors. What if the water turned into like black tar fecal matter? What do you think happens to the cow shit, Chris? I know that shit degrades and it makes land good and stuff, but I'm just saying it's gonna get stinky. It wouldn't. What if you lived in New York? You wouldn't be able... You would need a lot of people shitting in a very small place for it to overwhelm. Look, if you live in New York and everyone starts shitting on the streets, it's gonna pile up like you're just saying. Well yeah, if there's no ground or water source or... Especially if they got infinite chicken wings. Their shits will be you. If you're just sitting... If you're just shitting in the streets, yeah, it's gonna get out of control. There's no toilet at least to the... There's no water that goes to the ocean anymore. It's all your toilet clogged with chicken wings. I was assumed you were just shitting in a field or something and it was raining and it was just being carried by itself. Iowa was a bad example, but okay, you're in New York, your toilet, your bathtub is full of chicken wings. The water is not flowing no more. Yeah. You gotta catch rainwater with buckets now. Well yeah, 7 million people living in a quarter mile. It's gonna get stinky. It's gonna go bad very fast. The water turns into jello. It doesn't go bad.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:00.962 --> 0:53:02.127]: 
  tie- maintain

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:02.127 --> 0:53:02.549]: 
  It's nice.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:05.991 --> 0:53:06.683]: 
  Maybe they

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:13.770 --> 0:53:14.665]: 
  It makes me.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:33.379 --> 0:53:34.763]: 
  Pretty fast.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:43.234 --> 0:53:44.027]: 
  whole world actually.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:46.677 --> 0:53:48.415]: 
  Oh boy. Oh my god.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:50.187 --> 0:53:52.330]: 
  Not at all. Society would like crumble.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:56.903 --> 0:53:57.713]: 
  Okay, all right.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:59.063 --> 0:53:59.451]: 
  I mean

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:59.451 --> 0:54:00.345]: 
  I mean this is

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:06.319 --> 0:54:07.804]: 
  dead

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:06.370 --> 0:54:07.214]: 
  dead.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:09.255 --> 0:54:11.854]: 
  Yeah, nothing left alive.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:14.537 --> 0:54:14.706]: 
  Wait.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:24.392 --> 0:54:26.451]: 
  There would be just like, any birds that

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:35.817 --> 0:54:36.998]: 
  and float up to the sky.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:36.998 --> 0:54:37.555]: 
  The top of the world.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:39.597 --> 0:54:40.238]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:41.757 --> 0:54:42.449]: 
  That's a good question.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:46.583 --> 0:54:48.439]: 
  Completely.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:48.439 --> 0:54:50.549]: 
  They make up a good percentage of water.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:01.770 --> 0:55:03.492]: 
  If you think you're able to do this one.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:05.213 --> 0:55:06.495]: 
  There will probably be some disease.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:09.870 --> 0:55:10.934]: 
  Also the fish were all wet.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:14.528 --> 0:55:15.827]: 
  Well, there'd probably be a terrible smell.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:16.604 --> 0:55:17.498]: 
  That would never have happened.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:19.152 --> 0:55:21.632]: 
  Outside you'd smoke it inside if you're in Iowa

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:19.439 --> 0:55:19.827]: 
  side.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:23.286 --> 0:55:23.708]: 
  early.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:28.737 --> 0:55:29.024]: 
  Well,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:32.955 --> 0:55:33.242]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:40.583 --> 0:55:41.528]: 
  All of my humans.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:43.705 --> 0:55:45.325]: 
  Mmm, that's good. We put it all over.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:50.151 --> 0:55:50.455]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:52.007 --> 0:55:52.142]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:01.019 --> 0:56:02.301]: 
  But if there's no ocean water...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:04.073 --> 0:56:07.262]: 
  What is the water trick to the poop?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:08.562 --> 0:56:10.300]: 
  and just surrounded by fields.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:11.549 --> 0:56:11.954]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:15.160 --> 0:56:17.961]: 
  Break's down. Yeah, but it's like turtleizer.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:18.923 --> 0:56:19.497]: 
  I know but

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:21.825 --> 0:56:21.842]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:21.842 --> 0:56:22.939]: 
  with the work to the end.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:22.939 --> 0:56:23.952]: 
  Lots of neighbors

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:26.399 --> 0:56:27.209]: 
  What do you think happened to the guy?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:28.812 --> 0:56:30.938]: 
  I know that shit degrades and it makes life

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:30.938 --> 0:56:32.085]: 
  and good and stuff

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:40.202 --> 0:56:41.755]: 
  Look, if you live in New York, everyone's gonna...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:43.409 --> 0:56:44.657]: 
  Oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:46.716 --> 0:56:48.707]: 
  Especially if they got infinite chicken wings

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:52.150 --> 0:56:53.280]: 
  Get out of control.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:56.824 --> 0:56:57.314]: 
  I was the same.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:59.929 --> 0:57:01.043]: 
  Okay, okay, I hope

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:06.477 --> 0:57:08.907]: 
  The water is not flowing no more. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:10.425 --> 0:57:10.932]: 
  Well, yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:12.923 --> 0:57:13.497]: 
  a mile.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:13.497 --> 0:57:16.062]: 
  It's gonna go bad very fast

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:19.150 --> 0:58:02.822]: 
  We're watered. Refrigerated Jell-O, it's always refrigerated. What if there was no water, but you could, you could actually sustain your, you could, you'd have to eat Jell-O just to keep liquid in your body. Oh my God, that sounds like. To sustain yourself. It's horrible. These are disgusting situations. They know we're watered, it's Jell-O. It's Jell-O, so you see this ocean? It'd be kinda cool. You go to like a fancy steak restaurant and you're the only way to like get a beverage is to eat a cup of Jell-O with your steak. Yeah, but it gets required because you have to get rid of the Jell-O. You're parched, you're like, man, I'm thirsty. I need you to just eat Jell-O for five minutes. God got bored one day and turned the water into Jell-O, so he's like, now you have to pay for my sins. See if they eat all the Jell-O. It's gone, and then I'll give you water. It's the worst topic ever. It's cool.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:19.639 --> 0:57:20.331]: 
  refrigerator

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:21.529 --> 0:57:21.951]: 
  What if

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:21.951 --> 0:57:22.052]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:36.548 --> 0:57:37.763]: 
  So you see this ocean?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:38.505 --> 0:57:39.079]: 
  cool

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:44.513 --> 0:57:44.665]: 
  Oh.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:45.289 --> 0:57:45.525]: 
  GitHub is a great site.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:47.432 --> 0:57:48.023]: 
  This is your part.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:50.301 --> 0:57:51.685]: 
  I've got four to one day in terms of

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:52.529 --> 0:57:53.001]: 
  So he's like,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:53.001 --> 0:57:53.136]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:56.849 --> 0:57:56.950]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:03.599 --> 1:02:45.462]: 
  It doesn't even make any sense! You know that there's a law against advertising in the sky? Did you know that? Yeah. You have to pay for it. No, you don't. It's never gonna be allowed. What about a plane? What about there's a messenger plane? No, no, that's a plane. But I mean, like, people were thinking about, like, putting ads on the moon and shit. Oh, yeah, you can't do that. There's gonna be a big Pepsi logo on the moon. The moon, the moon... People try to buy the moon and put advertisers on it, but it's, like, fair use. Really? I mean, it's not fair use. I just heard that there's, yeah, there's a law against it. What's the law again? Like, you know, nobody can own a plot of land on the moon. Well, in that case, then, they can't land their fucking rover on the moon. I don't know. Or maybe it's co-owned by all the space agents. I have no idea. I have no idea how it works. Is it because money to own a part of the moon? I don't think they're actually selling. I think it's funny. A few years ago, I think one guy was fraudulently selling pieces of land on the moon. And people were sending him money, and he was sending him, like, certificates. You're like, OK, you own something, something, Planitia over here, next to this crater. And people believed it. Like, oh, cool. My great, great, great, great grandkids are going to live there. I wish you could just visit the moon for a day. I would love to do that. Speaking of supidity, did you see that Kickstarter, the underwater breather thing? What is that? Oh my god. Some people. What? There's a kit. It wasn't a kickstart. It was a go fund to me or something. Basically said, we've invented an underwater breather that converts all the oxygen. You know, you're breathing like a fish, essentially. It's converting the oxygen in the water into a breathable source of air for you to, you can just stay underwater indefinitely. That's impossible. Yeah, every scientist, everybody, you know, every expert in the field is like, this is complete bullshit. You need like 1,000 times the power that this thing's putting out to convert enough air. You need the air to go through the coast here. It needs to convert more. It needs to have water flowing through it faster than like a fire hose. You can't just put on a snorkel that turns into your mouth? No, I'm barely not. Or there's somebody's like, yeah, you can have, maybe you have a nuclear reactor attached to your face and might be able to push enough energy through it. There should really be like a scam button on Kickstarter. That's a problem with Inigogo because it's like these people, like it's funny too, because you get these people who say stuff like, help me through college. I'm a, you know, like it says all this stuff, like it's like, oh, I'm a trans autistic clubbed foot half blind. And they get $7. Yeah, and they get like $7,000 of what they're asking for because they say a bunch of stuff that they just sort as they have. And they're like, give me money and people give them money. Yeah, but here's the fuck dumping, but that's story. They almost got a million dollars. And then enough people called them out and they, okay, we're going to refund your money. We're going to relaunch the kickstart. And then they're like, by the way, oh yeah, that wasn't, that was all bullshit. We actually just have air canisters in this device. And people will just start to give it a money again. They're like, you're just blatantly lied. You completely lied the first time. And now you're probably lying again, even though it sounds more plausible and still complete lies. And people are like, yeah, oh yeah, here's your money. Indiegogo sucks in comparison to Kickstarter because it's like Indiegogo is like, you still get the money even if you don't make it. So these people go on there, like kids, they go on there and they're like, they're like, give me stuff so I can buy a new computer. They're just like, give me money. It's like they put their, they're like, I want to be able to play games. I just don't know. I just want to be able to play games. And they have their Indiegogo up there. It works for some people. But it's like, I don't understand how these people think that they can just be like, I'm going to make an Indiegogo and people are going to give me money. It's like, you kind of need a catch. You need to be disorderly or you need to use buzzwords because no one's going to give you any fucking money if you don't use any of those. Pretty much. Sorry, that's how it is. Do you have you guys seen the old Superman cartoon from the 30s or 40s, I forget which? The one that was well animated? Really, really well animated. It's crazy well animated. There's a cool little feature on YouTube I saw talking about it. Yeah, that's why I'm talking about it myself. The Snoop Dog feature? No, PSU. Superman. Snoopavision is fucking a shitty joke. And he said, it's still on YouTube. It's not funny. Why is it still on YouTube? It's not funny. That's their funny Halal, April Fool's joke. I know that, but what happened? I never actually clicked it. What happened? It's just him watching videos and you can watch it in 360 view. You can watch him watching a video in 360 view. But it's the video you clicked on? No, it's only if you pretty much write YouTube pics their best videos on YouTube, like Charlie bit my finger and then you click Snoopavision. Then you watch Snoop Dog inside of a cinema with a 360 view of. So they probably paid him a million dollars to watch like 10 videos. Yeah, and he's not giving a commentary or nothing. He's just like, man, that's whack. It's like, yeah. This whole year's April Fool's jokes sucked. Even Google sucked. Google fucked up. They got super shit. Google, they like got people fired from their jobs. Yeah, well, I mean like. Well, the other one too, like the Google, the VR mask thing, it's just this, such a tired idea. It's a VR mask, but it isn't. It's just you're looking through like a cardboard box or something. You don't think it's funny?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:08.391 --> 0:58:08.762]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:10.956 --> 0:58:11.631]: 
  gonna be a lot of play.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:26.025 --> 0:58:26.414]: 
  I'm sorry.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:31.712 --> 0:58:33.906]: 
  Well in that case then they can't let their fucking role be in the game.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:34.328 --> 0:58:35.138]: 
  I don't know.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:39.998 --> 0:58:40.268]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:56.485 --> 0:58:58.594]: 
  Nick's in this creator and people believed it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:04.889 --> 0:59:06.441]: 
  People are making a subpinity.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:06.441 --> 0:59:06.458]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:09.495 --> 0:59:10.103]: 
  What is that?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:11.790 --> 0:59:12.449]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:16.094 --> 0:59:17.089]: 
  Basically said.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:30.015 --> 0:59:30.505]: 
  That's...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:30.505 --> 0:59:30.792]: 
  pause.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:40.174 --> 0:59:40.343]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:41.642 --> 0:59:41.862]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:47.279 --> 0:59:47.835]: 
  Wh Vis

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:50.519 --> 0:59:51.210]: 
  I'm fairly not.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:56.290 --> 0:59:57.944]: 
  push enough energy through it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:00.424 --> 1:00:00.947]: 
  That's a-

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:00.947 --> 1:00:02.095]: 
  It's fucked up.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:16.877 --> 1:00:18.902]: 
  And they get seven dollars in the years.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:41.835 --> 1:00:43.894]: 
  People just started giving them money again. They're like,

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:55.116 --> 1:00:56.010]: 
  Here's your money.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:00.854 --> 1:01:01.326]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:27.837 --> 1:01:29.676]: 
  pretty much. So that's how it is.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:34.266]: 
 ...forget.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:37.945 --> 1:01:38.434]: 
  There's a cool...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:40.864 --> 1:01:41.252]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:43.952 --> 1:01:45.707]: 
  No, PS Man.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:48.036 --> 1:01:53.942]: 
  It's not funny. It's still on YouTube. It's not funny. Why is it still on YouTube? It's not funny.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:53.942 --> 1:01:55.022]: 
  What did that, what did you even have?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:55.984 --> 1:01:56.541]: 
  fool's joke.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:00.996 --> 1:02:01.671]: 
  Watch it.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:04.084 --> 1:02:06.464]: 
  But it's the video you clicked on? No.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:11.509 --> 1:02:11.999]: 
  and then you click.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:11.999 --> 1:02:12.724]: 
  It's just really amazing this new provision.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:16.791 --> 1:02:16.943]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:16.943 --> 1:02:17.787]: 
  He watches it and paints it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:19.356 --> 1:02:20.014]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:33.750 --> 1:02:34.999]: 
  Yeah, well I mean like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:47.504 --> 1:06:43.669]: 
  Come on, Jeff, go for the time. I know, I know, I'm out of touch. But yeah, that old Superman cartoon's really cool. The only, you know why no one talks about it or likes it? It's because all those old cartoons have really creepy sound. I think that's the reason. I think it is. Like, whenever I watch those old cartoons from the 30s and 40s, they're unwatchable, not because of the visuals, which are amazing. It's just because you're listening to those, it's like they're talking true of Tin Can all the time and the music sends like creepy fucking old men playing just trombones together. It's like... Do you think there's a superhero called Super Pooper's Superman? No. I'm gonna make him. You do that. Okay, all right, you do that. I like the idea, I like the reason how that pretty much the animators invented the Superman's flying super power just to save on time. Cause he used to be able to jump over buildings that was his super power. And animators are like, yeah, fuck this. Cause they have to animate him jumping all the time. Whatever they'd say in 1930 that it quated to fuck this. Well, Superman was like, you know, at first he was like faster than a speeding bullet and I was like, faster than light. More powerful than a locomotive. Superman. He can jump over buildings in a single bound. Yeah, that was it. But yeah, fuck that. Like nobody wants to jump around. I'm saying Superman is just a superhero where people are like, they're like two kids fighting. It's like I shot you. You know, I had an impenetrable shield. You can't shoot me. It's a bird. It's a plane. Yeah. No, it's Superman. That's why it's so, it's like, it's impossible to watch cause of how they're talking to that weird, what do you call it, transatlantic accent? Everybody in the 1940s and 50s talked like this. They didn't though. Lucky cigarettes. The villains look like something of a big creation. It's like a breath of fresh air. The villains look like something of a big creation. I wish they'd like, I wish they'd re-release with like newer sounds so people would be like cool. Cause when you watch it, why don't you, why don't you do a new voiceover? Or do a new voiceover for a super old two-person? It's not just the voice, it's mostly the music. The music's so like, yeah. It's just that shea old Disney sound where it's like. It really, it's crazy. I think, what did that cartoon say? Like every episode was a half a million dollar budget. Was that in counting for inflation or not? I have no idea. And that's like 30 million dollars back then or something. That's a lot of money. But then again, that's when they were only like three television stations and almost half the country was watching, wanted every point in time. There was like every TV show back then had way higher viewership than it does now. Oh, you didn't really have much options. No, everybody fucking watched like NBC, CBS, they had never seen anything like Superman back then. It was like crazy shit. And the cool thing is that, you know what? Superman's like too overpowered and kind of boring. Those cartoons show him like struggling all the time. So it's like fun to watch. That's what's upsetting is like he had like so much characteristic back then. Now he just became an empty shell of what he used to be. Now he's just his boring ass all over the power. I've never really liked him. I don't either. I don't like him because he's a character where he just, stuff makes, people just make shit up about him all the time. He's just a made up guy who just like, obviously he's made up. But he's like, they just make up powers for him so he can't die. He can't die. I hated Superman until I saw that game in Justice and they make him the bad guy and they're like, cool. It's like the only way he's like cool to me. The thing too is, think about it like this. Like what characters today, like in superhero characters are they're just surviving solely on nostalgia and not because they're good ideas. Like imagine if somebody wrote Superman today and then like he's just this perfect guy and green glowing space rocks are his only weakness. Like who wouldn't be thrown out of a meeting if they're trying to pitch this idea. It's kryptonite. They'd be thrown out anyway. It's just like really, is he straight white male too? That's why like Captain America is like a better version. Captain America is like the better version of Superman because he has like, he has his weaknesses and like he can die and shit. Captain America is cool and practical. Just like a super strong dude. I always hated the idea of kryptonite. It's just dumb. You throw a rocket and he's like, oh power. Oh. And then they are coming up with red kryptonite and yellow kryptonite and red makes him angry and blue makes him sad. Blue makes him angry. Is it blue kryptonite? Yellow kryptonite is just bananas. It's like the world's food supply.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:49.984 --> 1:02:50.288]: 
  the tweet.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:58.523 --> 1:02:58.827]: 
  I

  God, Chris, don't you know Superman? I thought it would make him jealous. Oh, jealous, and me? White Kryptonite would blind him, so he can't fucking see when he gets white Kryptonite. Yellow would turn him into an emoticon, and he'd start xD-ing and everything. This place would just turn into a place play. He turns him into a meme lord, super meme lord. Just watches internet videos all day. That's if you throw the Matrix rocks at him, like the fucking Matrix colored rock at him, he turns into a troll. He turns into a super troll. He's just typing at super speed, trolling the entire world at once. It's like, dude, you have to stop him. It's like kids are killing themselves, that's the right, he's killing the menace. Oh, these kids are killing themselves thousands of minutes because he's trolling, super trolling. It's like the opening of the happening of kids just falling out of giant buildings. Cuteness. He's causing these kids to kill themselves all over the world. What a polka-dot, Kryptonite, dude. That's dangerous. Polka-dot. It's poison, it fucking kills it, man. He's an idiot. That's green. Weakens him. What about Waldo colored stripe, Kryptonite? Waldo color, wow, now we're getting hard. Waldo, he sits down and reads a nice book of boys, Waldo.

Different fun, unique flavors. And he gives them to a bunch of different people. So people are throwing fucking rocks at Superman. He's doing all this shit. You imagine me the most powerful man in the world and people just are in colored rocks at you and I'm like co-coly altering your brain. Reception of everything.
