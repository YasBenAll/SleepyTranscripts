 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:55.585 --> 0:02:21.488]: 
  I got a real problem with everybody calling Dr. Robotnik, Dr. Eggman. And the other artists disagree with me and I'm having a mental breakdown about it. I have to go drugging my sonic OCs alone. You know what's funny? No matter how much you joke about these things, somebody would be like, wait, was he joking? And totally try to piece together all the tweets to try to reinforce that theory.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:10.907 --> 0:02:11.194]: 
  You're right.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:28.457 --> 0:02:35.815]:

  He said

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:06.224 --> 0:03:09.177]: 
  Your ball is here, your prostate is right here. I understand.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:07.793 --> 0:03:21.630]: 
  I understand the infection crawls up your dick hole goes into your prostate just dates and then spits back out through your balls It's just not masturbate enough. I don't it might have been that to be honest shit I never have problems like that. I know there's also not done

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:20.753 --> 0:03:25.377]: 
  There's also not doctors that say, you know, you need to masturbate more often because

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:25.073 --> 0:03:59.312]: 
  What if that's what the doctor wrote on a piece of paper like your prescription? Because I know what you need and on the prescription. Oh, just says jackoff. No two times daily There's any different types of jacking off this jacking off or you know, you just kind of you come, you know, but then I came Are you talking about the difference between like ah I came and oh no, I made a mess all over my computer Like the difference of like throwing up a little in your mouth like really like Everything you had for lunch

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:33.730 --> 0:03:35.502]: 
  But there's different types of Jacks.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:50.689 --> 0:03:51.837]: 
  over my computer.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:58.249 --> 0:04:05.556]: 
  That's amazing. You talk about the difference between doing it because you have to do it, like eating. Like you have a really good meal versus like you're eating because you have to.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:02.130 --> 0:04:02.957]: 
  you have a really good

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:05.185 --> 0:04:23.562]: 
  No, he's talking about the difference between like a kernel coming out of your ass when you're shitting or just taking like four loads out at once And you feel like after taking a dump like you've been asleep for 12 hours like whoa god So when you guys jack off it's all on your balls. It changes your life. And you know it when you have to.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:11.260 --> 0:04:11.648]: 
  and you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:12.610 --> 0:04:13.352]: 
  Take care Marshall!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:18.346 --> 0:04:20.355]: 
  So when you guys jack off, it's all on your body.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:22.785 --> 0:04:28.422]: 
  It looks like my Jack Ovis is just wasting my time and makes me feel worse. You gotta get shit out of me.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:28.422 --> 0:04:42.563]: 
  of your sister. There were a few stories about when we did move out to Sleepy Cabin Office that I thought were kind of fun, but they never got told. Nobody ever got to hear them, not on the podcast at least. I didn't want to share them without you. Jeff, you heard some of these, right?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:42.563 --> 0:04:43.913]: 
  I don't know what you're talking about.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:43.542 --> 0:04:48.959]: 
  Okay, I was there at some point. Yeah, you were there for some of them. Chad. Chris and Zach were working on hell better

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:45.179 --> 0:04:45.938]: 
  Yeah, you were there for so long.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:45.938 --> 0:04:46.191]: 
  implants são o do

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:48.149 --> 0:04:53.447]: 
  I'm gonna have to go back clarify a little bit for people that don't really know so we had an office. Oh, right

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:53.447 --> 0:05:32.412]: 
  Okay fully established. Stamper poured his heart and soul into this sleepy cabin office It was beautiful But yeah eventually the need for the office kind of dwindled and we decided to can the office unfortunately But when we moved it out when we moved out all the shit from the office a few things happened that night aside from Nile getting drunk while he smashed fluorescent lights against his face and I had mailings to do and he would not let me leave Until I turned on the camera so you could see Yeah, that was the moment when I decided maybe I just shouldn't be friends with any You know that was that was one of a couple of videos. There was a second video. I never really

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:21.544 --> 0:05:22.945]: 
  smash like and also add a video

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:22.945 --> 0:05:23.400]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:31.821 --> 0:05:38.790]: 
  That was the first time that Mick second guessed my judgment because I was supporting him enjoy

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:37.457 --> 0:05:53.117]: 
  Enjoy again. And then they combined it into Star Wars battle and I tried to let them know. I mean look it doesn't take a genius to figure out that a lightsaber fight with fluorescent light bulbs isn't going to last very long.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:40.900 --> 0:05:41.018]: 
  it

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:52.999 --> 0:05:55.817]: 
  Right, but then you have like a chunk in your hand, you can stab people. Yeah, that's not.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:55.007 --> 0:06]: 
  Yeah, that's the other thing too. But I remember you guys were trying to fight and like it was like you guys choreographed something you guys like oh no no I'll do this move you do that move it was like all right great they have a plan turn on the camera one two three and they just like smashed it against each other. Yeah it didn't work at all.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06 --> 0:06:19.459]: 
  Yeah, when you abandon something completely, it's just it's all just self-destructive. Yeah, I think the end of it

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:17.974 --> 0:06:36.469]: 
  Yeah, I think the end of it. It was just tear it all down. Just burn this fucking place down You know, I didn't do a lot of fond fond memories Stamping over there. We used to have that mangy fucking fox just running around. Oh, yeah garbage and trash or rubbish rubbish and garbage

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:22.176 --> 0:06:22.446]: 
  play

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:22.446 --> 0:06:23.222]: 
  Place down.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:22.497 --> 0:06:22.935]: 
  Peace down.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:30.951 --> 0:06:31.440]: 
  Oh yeah!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:35.642 --> 0:06:41.768]: 
  Yeah, like everybody asked me about garbage the fox but like Jeff was there all the time feeding them to yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:40.620 --> 0:06:50.594]: 
  Yeah, but you were the voice of that movement of the sushi pancakes and garbage shit all over the office.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:49.750 --> 0:06:54.475]: 
  Right, so a house cat and a fox that shit everyone.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:54.475 --> 0:07:19.922]: 
  And then we got two rats here three abandoned turtles and we had a stray dog too And then there was that never never disrespect the turtles there was the baby snake too remember oh, yeah Zippy it was like it was like the size of like your thumb nail. I can't believe I can remember his name I do We just had a video I don't think we ever put it out, but there was this baby snake I don't even know how you saw it. Yeah, so quick quick story

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:01.309 --> 0:07:02.828]: 
  It was literally and then there was that

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:04.617 --> 0:07:05.055]: 
  turtles

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:10.624 --> 0:07:13.493]: 
  I can't believe you fucking remembered his name. I do.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:13.493 --> 0:07:14.455]: 
  a number of snakes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:19.855 --> 0:07:38.991]: 
  I was fucking I don't know what was in my system, but I was out of my mind and it was night It was like pitch black is and it must smell like midnight 11 12 I went outside for a smoke. I came back in and I had a baby snake in my hand And I was like you gotta see this Mick. Yeah, it was a baby snake. It was just this little tiny snake. Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:34.469 --> 0:07:35.447]: 
  You gotta see this, man.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:34.992 --> 0:07:35.954]: 
  See this, Mick.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:38.991 --> 0:07:44.087]: 
  And we filmed it. It was so small that the phone had a hard time focusing on it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:44.087 --> 0:07:54.111]: 
  look like a tiny rattlesnake. Yeah it had like the... It would like whip around in your hand and like try to bite your finger but his face was too small. It was like a earthworm size. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:45.758 --> 0:07:47.260]: 
  Yeah, it had like the...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:51.580 --> 0:07:52.154]: 
  Oh.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:53.689 --> 0:08:05.232]: 
  Yeah, but he had those big black eyes, you know like the cute anime Truth be told I've never seen a baby snake and we looked it up like what do we feed it and like none of the things They said to feed it would even fit in this thing. I think

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:57.503 --> 0:07:59.444]: 
  I'm just gonna be true to be told, I've never seen a baby snake before.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:04.641 --> 0:08:10.665]: 
  I think I was like... Fall off outside and I fed it into the yard like a lucky year. I'm just witted. It's hard.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:07.814 --> 0:08:08.961]: 
  I wish it worked you a year.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:10.665 --> 0:08:29.582]: 
  I kinda wanna befriend more wild animals, I think. Kinda like the fox. I like the- I like this idea of having an animal pal that I have to take care of. Yeah. He can take care of himself. And just come and visit sometimes, and I'll pet him, and he'll just go off and- go off on his own fucking adventures. And this is- And come back. It's funny-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:27.895 --> 0:09:05.003]: 
  And this is it's one of the big things that people don't understand like you put out a video like garbage of fucks And it's fascinating listening to all the people criticizing you on that pretty much 75% of them are afraid of them They're like don't do that. You don't even close them don't touch them don't even fucking worry about it It's just weird like backwards cruelty and then in my mind where he's tiny and useless and sick Yeah, and then you got these other assholes that are like oh You shouldn't be feeding him lunch means I'm just saying because I did a lot of research She got like the paranoid people to make up the big point and then like asshole people if they

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:40.770 --> 0:08:44.550]: 
  Don't do that. Don't even close them. Don't tell them. Don't even fucking worry about them.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:52.043 --> 0:08:52.364]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:05.003 --> 0:09:16.815]: 
  I think they know everything. It's almost like somebody else's pet, right? Like, let's say you own some cute animal. I don't have to take care of it, but I can watch you take care of it and enjoy that, you know? So I can sit by on the side and enjoy it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:16.630 --> 0:09:39.192]: 
  Like I did a YouTube video with the turtles and you got the assholes and like you know your diet for your turtles It's a little it's like okay, and there's like two thumbs up Yeah, and it's like you really shouldn't be treating your rats like that It's like you know what though my rats have been alive for like a year and a half and they have a two-year lifespan Yeah, could you just let me give them some fucking cranberries and candy and then in this?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:24.224 --> 0:09:24.747]: 
  in this way.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:25.844 --> 0:09:26.654]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:28.881 --> 0:09:29.438]: 
  It's like, you know what?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:34.619 --> 0:09:34.990]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:38.618 --> 0:09:48.439]: 
  And then when you talk about it on the podcast Just send him out racially Drinking a bottle of fucking piss and cigarette butts There's nobody going around being like You should really Yeah, don't just say people like Don't

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:40.373 --> 0:09:41.976]: 
  destination where you're drinking up

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:46.279 --> 0:09:48.456]: 
  Yeah, those are the same people I don't!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:46.397 --> 0:09:46.414]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:50.262 --> 0:09:54.919]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:50.329 --> 0:09:50.970]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:53.654 --> 0:09:57.687]: 
  They were gods. Genuinely, honestly, they were eating better than we were.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:55.544 --> 0:10:24.299]: 
  Honestly, they were eating better than we were. Yeah. Better than we were. I was not going to feed that thing by hand, but then I knew better. I knew this thing could be scared or sick and bite me, and I'd be immediately on my way to the emergency room to get fucking shots. Yeah. But you know, because Stamper is a nice guy and reckless. He decided to feed him by hand, and I'm like, well, I can't look like a fucking pussy here. So I guess I'll just do the same thing. But that thing was grateful, man. He just took the food right out of our hands.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:07.491 --> 0:10:09.010]: 
  to get fucking shots.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:12.689 --> 0:10:13.262]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:23.607 --> 0:10:33.765]: 
  You misunderstand me. I am cautiously and understandably reckless. So I don't walk into reckless situations.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:30.492 --> 0:10:30.627]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:31.589 --> 0:10:38.997]: 
  So I don't walk into reckless situations. You treat foxes and homeless guys the same. Kind of. You know they can hurt you, but no.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:37.107 --> 0:10:37.461]: 
  you know

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:38.659 --> 0:10:49.425]: 
  Now, everybody has a trigger in their stomach where you look at something, any situation, and you say, this isn't for me, and you turn around and you walk away. Maybe my trigger's just better than yours, bigger than yours, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:41.494 --> 0:10:43.958]: 
  Look at something, any situation you say this isn't

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:50.235 --> 0:11:02.993]: 
  I don't know. You know that little buzz that you get in your gut? Your spidey senses, your stamper senses? Oh, give me a break. How many situations in life where you should have been like, I'm gonna walk away. A lot. And you didn't, and you didn't. Well, no.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:51.180 --> 0:10:53.948]: 
  You know that little buzz that you get in your gut?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:53.948 --> 0:10:54.471]: 
  Bye, decent.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:02.993 --> 0:11]: 
  Well, that's the ones that you see. But I walk away from, it's like every time you guys see a situation that I'm in, you're like, okay, but you don't see like the 30 other situations.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:04.377 --> 0:11:04.714]: 
  But I won't.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:07.060 --> 0:11:07.077]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11 --> 0:11:32.372]: 
  Situations I walk away from all day. I think it's I think really what Jeff is saying is that you end up in a situation Do you have 30 situations to walk away from while most people you know? It may be a handful of say life is born. Yeah, he does you do keep things interesting for better or worse You've always managed mainly for worse

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:24.542 --> 0:11:25.437]: 
  That would be the one of the seven.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:25.437 --> 0:11:27.495]: 
  Life is boring.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:27.495 --> 0:11:29.234]: 
  He does, you do keep things in her.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:31.579 --> 0:11:37.654]: 
  Mainly for worse, I'm not gonna argue there. I'll tell you one thing though, I'm still alive.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:35.494 --> 0:11:39.645]: 
  I'll tell you one thing though, I'm still alive. You always got a story to tell, this is bad.

This actually made me sick. It was bullshit. So they hand us the IDs Board cop for 30 minutes. No, and then event well No, no, no, then now brought up that we did like a podcast together And then she was like oh, yeah do some podcasty stuff for me or something like okay?

  Look, I was trying to do damage control. Nile was straight up hitting on her. There was no damage to control at all! Alright. In with! So that was the night and we got back. There were still a few more moves we had to do. But while I was doing the mailing, I got a text from you, Stamper. Yeah. So that story was annoying and unnecessary. Your story is fucking bizarre.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:35.204 --> 0:15:35.220]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:45.902 --> 0:15:46.375]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:59.925 --> 0:16:01.427]: 
  If you don't, I'll try to fill in the blank.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:01.124 --> 0:16:26.875]: 
  Okay, good. So from what I remember is as I was coming back home I got pulled over in the same spot on the same fucking road by the same bored fucking cops dude comes up to my window and I forget the conversation we had beforehand, but I'm looking at him I say you just you just pulled us over, you know, not a couple hours ago and he said no, sir I've never seen you before I was like no, yeah, I was in the U-Haul van. I was in the back

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:23.669 --> 0:16:24.495]: 
  I was like, no, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:25.424 --> 0:16:29.339]: 
  I was in the back and he was like, uh... No, you didn't say you hall van.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:29.204 --> 0:16:35.768]: 
  That's what the thing was! It was like, uh... That was where you came in. Oh, okay, okay, start off, start off, start off.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:31.026 --> 0:17:07.627]: 
  Yes, it was like that was where you Okay, so okay All right, well to be fair I understand why you don't remember Here's what happened. Okay. You were super fucking trashed You were driving now you were driving 70 miles an hour in a 35 zone now I was trying to get so you got pulled over This is what I remember and I will never forget you said that you were pulled over the headlights of the cops car in your Rearview mirror blinded you so you could not see the two cops as they both flanked your car coming up to the driver's side area

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:44.897 --> 0:16:46.500]: 
  You were driving.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:46.500 --> 0:16:46.939]: 
  now.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:51.495 --> 0:16:51.647]: 
  Thanks.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:07.492 --> 0:17:09.551]: 
  That's why he's just a little call of duty.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:08.589 --> 0:18:15.145]: 
  Well, one is on one side, one's on the other, that's flanking. As the officer gets to your window, they knock on the window, and you look in the man's face and realize that you've seen him before. That it was the exact same fucking cop that pulled us over just a couple hours before. Now, he didn't recognize you. This, this you didn't mention, but that you were in the back of the van, so he never saw your face. Right. But you saw his face from the back of the van, because you were looking out the windows and filming everything. The way you were describing it though, he was asking you, he was like, do you know how fast you were going? And you were like, oh yeah, I was probably going real fast. And he's like, yeah. Yeah, that was what started it. But then he asked you if you had been drinking. Yeah. And you said you were sweating fucking bullets. Dude, I was laced in, dude. Because if, I mean, that would be your license. You wouldn't have talked about the limit. I was a bum beyond the limit. Yeah, you would have been done. You wouldn't have had a fucking license. I was in the Washington flight limit. You said you admitted to me like, yeah, I'm drinking while you're resting there, or something like that. Yeah, no, you said something to them. There was total affirmation about the drinking, but they, no. Yeah, so you said that you had been drinking, and then they asked you to step out of the vehicle. And in that moment.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:51.419 --> 0:17:51.739]: 
  Why are you...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:51.435 --> 0:17:51.942]: 
  Wait!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:51.942 --> 0:17:52.499]: 
  Because

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:53.730 --> 0:17:56.447]: 
  That would be your license. You want to talk about the limit? I was a bottom beyond the limit.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17 --> 0:18:00.126]: 
  It ends up watching you slight limit

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:03.737 --> 0:18:04.311]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:04.007 --> 0:18:04.227]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:14.385 --> 0:18:19.650]: 
  In my mind, it's like, you look, if a cop says, have you been drinking, you don't say no, you say

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:19.650 --> 0:19:19.860]: 
  Yeah. Even though like five minutes ago you just told me I should have never admitted I was drinking. That's not global advice. You can't give that to everybody but people know what I'm talking about. No I do, I do. But what happened was is they asked you to step out of the vehicle and you said that your mind was racing. You were trying to find any way not to get out of the fucking car and the only thing you can say and you were so happy that it occurred to you. You saw the guy's face and you're like hey don't I know you? Like total distraction from what was actually happening. You're just trying to like change the subject and the guy's like what? No what? I don't know you and you're like no no I'm not. I'm pretty sure I know you and like you wouldn't drop it and he started getting really frustrated and finally you said something like no. I know. Yeah he wanted a fucking breath alive. He wanted to get on. Yes but then you were like I was the guy. I was the guy in the back of the van. You just pulled us over a couple hours ago and the guy said, the cop said to you I don't know what you're talking about. I haven't pulled over any U-Hauls today. Yeah and then you were like.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:30.872 --> 0:18:32.104]: 
  But when it happens... Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:04.521 --> 0:19:07.187]: 
  He wanted a fucking breath alive. He wanted to get, yes.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:17.717 --> 0:19:17.734]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:20.755 --> 0:20:06.452]: 
  I never said I was in a U-Haul. Yeah. And you said that in that moment, his eyes just got really big. And he walked away like a toddler. Yeah, he got really silent and just fucking turned around and walked away. He was like, uh-uh-uh-uh. And then the other cop came back up with his ID, handed it back. It was just like, okay, you can go. I don't understand. It's just like, what the fuck does he have to mean? I don't understand why he did that. You had him dead to rights. He did. Oh god, if he just shut his mouth, you would have been done. But then it caught him in a lot. He should have been in jail that night. Yeah, dude, there were so many reasons why you should have been in so much trouble. And I just remember you texting like, I don't know how I got out of this. Like, is there like a jurisdiction?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:26.475 --> 0:19:28.450]: 
  And he walked away on the top. Yeah, he got really silenced.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:45.949 --> 0:19:46.995]: 
  I have no one.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:52.446 --> 0:19:52.952]: 
  And it's

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:55.939 --> 0:19:56.884]: 
  You have a-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:56.884 --> 0:19:57.154]:

  I have no idea.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:12.494 --> 0:21:13.986]:

So I'm Larry David making Larry David faces, trying to avoid my tire driving through vomit on the road. 30 seconds later, the door opens again and they start vomiting again out the door. The car is not stopping. And I am swerving, trying to not hit the car into the lane to the left of me, trying to avoid vomit on the road. It's splattering. Dude, it's splattering ever. It's all, it's like, we talked about that. It's hitting the ground. It's 60 miles an hour or whatever. It's hitting the car, it's down to the side of the car. We talked about.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:50.453 --> 0:21:54.756]: 
  It's like, are we talking about that? It's hitting the ground at 60 miles an hour or whatever.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:56.815 --> 0:22:04.459]:

  What was the conversation in the car? Yeah, like, dude's driving, it's like, dude, I need to pee. He's like, we can't stop. We need to keep going, dude. You're kind of half expecting this person to just fall out of the car. This person vomited four separate times. The car would not stop. The end.

  Yeah, like whips his shit out of you. But that's on the 6th, so guess what happens on the 24th? Guess who brings the gift? I don't know. Jesus.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:15.299 --> 0:25:23.719]: 
  I don't know. Jesus. Cuppin' Froggin and he throws you in a well and wishes you the best of luck. It's little baby Jesus. Watch as you climb out.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:21.576 --> 0:26:08.337]: 
  It's little baby Jesus flying around in his crib. Wait, who is it? Little baby Jesus. How does he know what to give you? How does he give you presents? He's got these tiny little hands. Fucking Jesus. Does he just, do they just materialize or does he have a big bag of toys? No, he has a tiny bag of toys with this tiny bag of games. He has it all in his crib. So you're saying, we have Christmas ornaments where we have Santa Claus on a sleigh with a reindeer and then we put it on our roofs and shit like that. You're saying in Germany or in Switzerland, they've got a baby in a crib flying in the air, dropping presents on people. Yes. You're fucking kidding. I'm not making this up. I'm not making that up. And you can imagine that pretty early on as a child, I thought like this is obviously just bullshit and like our parents are giving us stuff. Yeah, because,

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:24.749 --> 0:25:24.951]: 
  great.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:26.841 --> 0:25:27.229]: 
  How does he...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:30.655 --> 0:25:31.414]: 
  and an sz!)

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:35.835 --> 0:25:36.004]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:38.384 --> 0:25:39.784]: 
  He has it all in his crib.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:39.497 --> 0:25:39.700]: 
  RIP

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:06.987 --> 0:26:07.004]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:07.999 --> 0:26:14.108]: 
  The dude that comes down through the chimney and sneaks through your house and throws shit under it. Yeah, it actually makes more sense.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:12.522 --> 0:26:39.370]: 
  Yeah, it actually makes more sense that a baby would fit down my chimney than a big fat guy. There was no chimneys in our stories. He flew up to the window, you could fly in his crib. What? He flimed your window and what? Break your window and throw the presents into your window? I don't know. It's obviously not as well thought out as the Americans. So what do kids do if a German kid and a Swiss kid meet up and they talk about Christmas? They have completely different stories. They're like, oh did that creepy black dirty Santa come and beat you up? No. I guess I must be ignorant.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:21.398 --> 0:26:22.950]: 
  What he flapped your window and what?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:25.110 --> 0:26:25.262]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:28.975 --> 0:26:29.346]: 
  So what are you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:38.121 --> 0:26:45.462]: 
  I guess I must be ignorant or something, but I never understood how the German language tied into... We don't have the same language.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:43.875 --> 0:26:49.461]: 
  We don't have the same language. Swiss German is completely different. But it's called Swiss German? Yeah. Really?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:46.829 --> 0:26:51.992]: 
  But it's called Swiss German? Yeah. Really? Or is it like English versus UK English?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:51.992 --> 0:27:00.413]: 
  completely different. Oh really? Are you sure? Hold on, hold on. If I went and learned German, we couldn't communicate. You could not communicate with sister. Period.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:59.417 --> 0:27:03.822]: 
  In it's period at all. You were a fucking liar. At all. At all.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:03.771 --> 0:27:52.455]: 
  Swiss German is completely different than German Swiss German is in Switzerland Do you call your language Swiss German you call it sweet? So you call your own language Swiss German Does it look the same when you write it? No, that's right. This is fucking different. Why don't you just call it Swiss? They put it on the spot. I know they feel guilty now. They bastardize They're just like we don't have enough time to make our own language We're just gonna call this Swiss German, but it's nothing like German We have the super married brothers too of German language Yeah, I tell you guys about my Christmas.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:46.092 --> 0:29:51.407]: 
  You see, Form? I think it's like this urban legend that a lot of movie directors like... DIE!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:50.445 --> 0:30:20.550]: 
  director's like die hard that's what it was die hard you're a dirty liar Jeff live your own life is that like your wet dream to be I don't want to be John McClain and die hard one and three you know what for a first for a brief moment there yeah I thought you actually had a x y yeah I actually said I had also have kids I knew you know yeah I know that was that was impossible you're very perceptive yeah because I can't imagine you having kids without fucking there

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:55.592 --> 0:29:55.609]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:57.550 --> 0:29:58.512]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:12.518 --> 0:30:17.580]: 
  Yeah, that was impossible. You're very perceptive.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:23.284 --> 0:30:39.214]: 
  Well, that is offensive. What if he told you he had kids and he fucked them? I wouldn't believe him. Wait, you said you would believe him then? No, I wouldn't believe him because he would be in prison. What if he said he had kids and he thought about fucking him? You'd be like, oh, I believe you now. No, I wouldn't believe him. Why? Because he would have acted out on you in prison.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:30.135 --> 0:30:30.726]: 
  even now.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:40.379 --> 0:32:10.137]: 
  You're projecting. That's what I think we're doing. You're projecting. I don't have kids. You know, speaking of fucking kids though, maybe we should talk about a thing that occurred lately. You know how that one podcast you were talking like to Cory about like pedophiles luring kids in with Minecraft? That was the one that we had where we were talking about how like nowadays molesters have to get savvy with the times when they want to molest kids. What was your suggestion that they just start a Minecraft server and just like invite kids to it or something? Are you trying to like paint me as this madman? No, no, no, no. It's about... No, but it happens to be something that it's interesting that we would joke about it. We made a joke. Yeah. Minecraft lures kids in and apparently popular Minecraft players are now being caught left and right. Yes. The most recent one. But they were already getting caught left and right. Oh yeah, left and right. But that one was... But it just doesn't seem to be slowing down. No, no, yeah. That one was like seems to be like the most offensive case. Yeah. This one? Yeah. So who is this again? They call him Lion Maker. Okay. And apparently I'm not into Minecraft at all. Yeah. I never look at anything but it was just such a notorious case that I couldn't happen but hear about it. What exactly were the... what exactly was the offense? The offense were that he was accused of hitting on this underaged girl. Okay, well that's bad but it's not the worst thing. I mean it's terrible but it's not like... Ages. Sorry, what? Ages. I was in my twenties and she was like... I think fifteen. Every time someone says underage...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:13.690 --> 0:31:15.951]: 
  No, no, no, no, it's a-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:20.490 --> 0:31:21.739]: 
  joke.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:27.443 --> 0:31:28.995]: 
  Yes, the most recent one.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:29.738 --> 0:31:33.265]: 
  Oh, yeah, I didn't write but that one just doesn't seem to be slowing down. No, no, yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:37.180 --> 0:31:38.007]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:38.007 --> 0:31:39.036]: 
  So who is this again?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:59.252 --> 0:32:00.720]: 
  Okay, well that's bad.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:03.049 --> 0:32:03.589]: 
  It's not like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:08.601 --> 0:32:13.512]: 
  Every time somebody says underage it means 17 to 1. Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:11.942 --> 0:34:39.362]: 
  Yeah, yeah, she was like 15 or something and he was like mid-20s. Yeah, he's late late 20s Okay, and apparently he shared like some child porn on Twitter or something which I thought her I don't know what like I can say I don't know the whole story I just kind of got in late like I saw a lot of stuff about it on Twitter No, I just heard a lot of stuff about it on Twitter and like he shut down his Twitter and he came back and put it back up It was really weird and like I think actively he admitted to it But then he keeps saying that he's being defamed like it's this whole strange thing and so like the morbid Curiosity kind of got a hold of me. It's like I want to look up this guy's channel Okay, and I went to like his channel and it was like all these like just tons of Minecraft video One of them was like in a Star Wars world. Oh, yeah, I mean that's what Minecraft Let's play you do they just play Minecraft you could see that at first like some of his videos They were like well received a lot of upvotes and stuff and suddenly they start to have a lot of downvotes Then some of the later ones the comments were disabled see as soon as the comments go You know, that's when there's probably tons of downvotes Yeah, then his latest video was entitled hide and go seek and It was just nothing but downvotes the comments disabled and you see like this anthropomorphic Minecraft lion Running around like playing hide and seek with mute children who are running away from him Just him like talking in this PewDiePie voice like Hey, how's it going guys? It's me and Lionmaker And it's he was trying to make no there's a humorous situation No, he was not he was not there's a disclaimer saying hey guys Lionmaker isn't feel it's feeling under the weather a little lately I just don't think there's anything more distasteful or just ironic than a guy getting pinned for being a pedophile Dressing up in an animal outfit and chasing kids Well, no, but that's like his character It's just how do people not think that they're gonna get caught for their first which is my head just go off I guess they're just willing to do anything and everything But I mean goddamn the internet is such a small place just their lust lust for children apparently you wait You would said something like there was there was some girl that also had a channel right? Yeah, so one of the girls he hit on apparently also had like her own little Minecraft channel So it's like they probably you probably promises kids like to share their stuff with his fame

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:15.014 --> 0:32:18.338]: 
  And he was like mid 20s. Yeah, late late 20s. Okay

  Thanks.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:03.147 --> 0:36:42.938]: 
  I think this song's realistic. So I'm gonna do, I'm gonna build Nakatomi Tower in Minecraft. Build little Minecraft terrors. And then I'm gonna- And then weave a tale about how your life was- I'm gonna look for children who are also into die hard, like me. And then get caught and go to jail. That's my friend. In the game? Oh no, you mean in real life you get caught. If you get caught in real life. Look, sexy kids that also like the die hard, like die hard 1 and 3, but not 2, 4 and 5. Are willing to go to jail for it. You're willing to go to jail for that. That's the fun part of that game. That could be a subplot of his real story, right? Like he's telling that and then he just like adds that-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:04.986 --> 0:36:05.627]: 
  I don't know what to do.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:07.838 --> 0:36:08.226]: 
  Mm-hmm

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:10.420 --> 0:36:11.804]: 
  and then we

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:11.804 --> 0:36:13.947]: 
  Leave a tail about how your life was.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:32.003 --> 0:36:35.969]: 
  are willing to go to jail for it. You're willing to go to jail for that.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:33.083 --> 0:36:33.269]: 
  Go for it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:42.938 --> 0:36:46.380]: 
  So then it just confuses the audience.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:46.380 --> 0:36:51.409]: 
  This little girl messaging me, she's like, you know, I like Diver 5. I'm like, get out of here!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:50.042 --> 0:36:52.658]: 
  Get out of here! You're nuts. You're nuts.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:52.658 --> 0:37:20.114]: 
  You know, it's so sad. I love Bruce Willis, but he's got like this cra- if you look at IMDB It's like half the movies he does are just trash and the other I feel like a lot of them are really good But it's like clearly a job like he's just like some of the actors just have more discretion with the roles they take Like Johnny Depp does the same thing. He does a ton of great movies and he does a ton of fucking trash. What's a trash movie about Johnny Depp? Transcendence

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:15.405 --> 0:37:15.895]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:17.093 --> 0:37:17.498]: 
  Wow

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:17.498 --> 0:37:24.180]: 
  I'm pretty trash. You're looking at the server, you're looking at what they deliver, but you don't see what happens.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:24.180 --> 0:37:48.936]: 
  Oh no, I agree. There's so many... When it's business and you're doing what you do. And to be fair, like we've seen plenty of movies that the premise seems great. Like Transcendence. It's got a lot of good actors and somehow, and the production quality is there, but somehow it just sucks. Would you say Transcendence would be one of those? It has good actors, it has good production quality. It started off good. And then it just sucks.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:32.517 --> 0:37:33.327]: 
  It's got to...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:42.169 --> 0:37:43.806]: 
  It has good actors.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:46.185 --> 0:38:22.990]: 
  started off good. It's a lack of communication between the directors and the technical team and the actors. So there's never like a harmonious vibe in any event. But it makes me wonder like- So it's very like robotic and everything. Right. Seriously, the last 20 movies we pulled up on Hulu or Voodoo or Netflix or whatever, they were very clinical by the book. Right. Pieces of shit that, truthfully, the one thing that I can say that was special about the last, honestly, maybe 13 movies we watched was the post-production of the raw footage color-wise. That's about it. Like visually.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:57.475 --> 0:37:58.639]: 
  But it makes me wonder like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:59.939 --> 0:38:01.575]: 
  Right, seriously, the last 20 minutes.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:05.845 --> 0:38:06.132]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:06.132 --> 0:38:06.149]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:08.595 --> 0:38:08.849]: 
  great

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:22.450 --> 0:38:30.516]: 
  Paul Rudd. So you continue Paul Rudd. No, you know what was funny is that when we were watching we should like begin and everything was just Paul Rudd.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:24.711 --> 0:38:25.994]: 
  Yo, you're always funny.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:25.994 --> 0:38:27.495]: 
  is that when we were watching...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:27.495 --> 0:38:34.937]: 
  we should like begin and end everything with just Paul. Just like, thank you for joining Sleepy Cass and Sleepy Cabin and final five.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:34.937 --> 0:38:54.428]: 
  on Paul Rudd. Yeah, but when we were watching it the first thing on his hand was like, wait how old is Paul Rudd? And then we were like looking it up and he's like, damn he's in great shape. Like he aged really well. How do you think Paul Rudd is? I know he's somewhere between like 42 and 45. 46? AAH! Alexa!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:47.560 --> 0:38:47.644]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:47.644 --> 0:38:49.905]: 
  I know it's similar to...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:52.673 --> 0:38:55.997]: 
  Six. Alexa, how old is Paul Rudd?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:56.875 --> 0:38:59.069]: 
  Paul Rudd is 46 years old.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:59.085 --> 0:39:00.503]: 
  46.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:00.503 --> 0:39:07.624]: 
  who's pulling up on 50. Those Avengers heroes, a lot of them, they're all gonna be like 50 and all the women are gonna be 30. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:01.414 --> 0:39:04.671]: 
  Those vendors here, there are all gonna be like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:07.118 --> 0:39:15.370]: 
  Yeah. And at the end of the day, nobody's going to care about that black dude that has those wings that... What is he, Falcon? Yeah, is he Falcon?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:12.990 --> 0:39:17.952]: 
  Is he Falcon? Yeah, is he Falcon? Yeah, Falcon. I'll tell you what he is. He was worth a lot of money.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:16.517 --> 0:39:34.995]: 
  I'll tell you what he is, he was worthless in the first movie and then he got beat by Ant-Man in the second movie before he even understood his power. Hey Mick, what's your goal with Sleepy Cabin? What do you hope to achieve here? Entertain some people. Yeah? Why couldn't you do that by yourself? Well I could, but...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:30.169 --> 0:39:31.300]: 
  entertain some people.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:30.996 --> 0:39:31.283]: 
  people.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:34.422 --> 0:39:40.328]: 
  but it's fun to do it with a group of people. Cool. And I want to work with you. Yeah. Whatever you're ready.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:36.295 --> 0:39:36.632]: 
  people.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:38.624 --> 0:39:56.815]: 
  You know, whatever you're ready. I feel like we've been sitting on a couch for like last fucking doing what we feel is best for people versus actually talking about. You know, if all this shit was off, we would have a completely different conversation. It's fucking ridiculous. There is some waiting there. Hold on, hold on, hold on, no.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:44.378 --> 0:39:45.897]: 
  doing what we feel is

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:54.537 --> 0:40:02.991]: 
  There is still something going on. No, so I want to know what were you doing for the first 10 episodes? In the first 10 episodes, we were

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:02.991 --> 0:40:22.229]: 
  being ourselves will progress and you know we you know it only takes 72 hours for your entire life to completely flip upside down. I don't disagree. If you establish something very early and it takes off and people really like it and you have to keep that going because that's what people expect.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:12.981 --> 0:40:13.943]: 
  I don't disagree.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:21.368 --> 0:40:26.565]: 
  So you're saying you're completely different now than you used to be back now? No, but what I'm saying is...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:24.709 --> 0:40:45.584]: 
  No, but what I'm saying is in a lot of ways if you start a series for example You feel this obligation to keep like rolling with the punches because that's what people expect even from the beginning I feel like we were just kind of delivering things to people in a in We were very Graceful about everything we were saying so and we're still we're still doing it now. They're still

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:33.957 --> 0:40:35.475]: 
  Even from the beginning I feel like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:42.968 --> 0:40:43.626]: 
  We're still...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:44.520 --> 0:40:49.566]: 
  And now there's so much truth to what what Samper said and everybody else is doing it too like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:47.254 --> 0:40:53.987]: 
  And everybody else is doing it too. Like, truthfully, if these microphones were off right now and we were talking, it would be

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:53.498 --> 0:42:13.317]: 
  It would be a completely different show. Yeah, we're pumping things up a little bit. Well, maybe I'm just... We're trying to entertain people. No, no, I am curious. I'm speaking for myself. Absolutely, but you're speaking for yourself. I am curious what you mean by that, though. I think that, if I may say it, that Samper kind of thinks that it becomes very anecdotal, that everything is supposed to be like, oh, here's the story with this punchline. No, this is kind of funny. Let me tell this story. Rather than being like an actual organic conversation where we explore a subject and like we usually do when we talk to each other. Right, and I think that's, you know, there were plenty of podcasts where we did just tell stories and it didn't have to be... Like funny or... Yeah, like we could just talk and people actually love those episodes too. I know, I don't know what the big fucking deal is. Just, I can't just... Part of it is expectation. So like when you get to make something on your own terms and people tend to like it, great, but as soon as you're feeling obligated to do it or it's contrived because people expect it, then it's not you doing what you wanna do anymore. You're kind of like forcing this thing that people expect you to do. I mean, for better or worse, nothing we've done has been contrived or forced. I mean, we're just... It's exaggerated at times. It's exaggerated at times, but we're trying to entertain people, so sometimes we exaggerate, but... I feel like people... You know, it's just, we're being ourselves. It's not like you have like,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:58.004 --> 0:41:00.096]: 
  Well maybe we're trying to entertain people.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:16.414 --> 0:41:16.971]: 
  No look.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:27.450 --> 0:41:27.788]: 
  All right.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:33.762 --> 0:41:33.947]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:33.947 --> 0:41:34.234]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:37.744 --> 0:41:38.942]: 
  I know, like, I don't know

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:58.365 --> 0:41:59.142]: 
  I mean for better

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:03.344 --> 0:42:05.385]: 
  It's exaggerated at times.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:12.557 --> 0:42:23.492]: 
  It's not like you have to bring things out of yourself to... But I feel like there's a way that we're not... There's like millions of people that follow us and I just feel like we sit in this room and we...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:23.492 --> 0:44:02.498]: 
  We're like I mean we talk people know that but for an hour and a half a week People get to hear people they enjoy be silly and stupid and tell some life stories and be one thing it was gonna be a Mix of the goofy stuff if we had something goofy happen to us tell a funny entertaining story We do the we do an equal matter what stampers talk about if we have a serious topic talk about that I always thought that's what it was supposed to be right Again, because reader the whole point of this thing this was never supposed to be like the main thing This was like we spent all our time effort writing scripts working on these other product This was supposed to be this thing when we just once a week Well, it was one of the two hours steam remind people were still around Entertainment with whatever we feel like talking about it wasn't supposed to be this wondering if we're wasting people's time It was supposed to be bullshit. Yeah, bolt disposed You know fairly disposable content and I know yeah, we still put some effort in edit it But when you're just losing sleep over wondering if a podcast is good enough or not I feel like you're kind of taking the wrong angle that all that effort should be probably going into something else anyways Yeah, this is just this thing to remind people that yeah, we're still here. We're interacting with our audience and really You know put that effort into something else We really care about whether I'm making a game or if I feel like writing a fucking book or you feel like writing a rap Album or whatever it's you know, that's where you're probably your heart and soul should go into something that's going to Last through time or whatever this is just this thing to keep away to get away from our desks enjoy ourselves I have some conversation

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:34.984 --> 0:42:36.098]: 
  be in a reverence.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:51.539 --> 0:42:52.230]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:30.501 --> 0:45:34.365]:
