 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:40.219 --> 0:07:11.249]: 
  That's the real it. Yeah, I don't like being the introductory Introducty, but still everything with now keep the rest. No, did you make coffee? I Sure did. I mean, nobody scoops that you use of the coffee a good mom. How buddy? No, I know I use about the Stamper uses way too much. I have a huge you use a bit more than I usually use But you don't use near as much as tamper uses with ever like strong coffee, you know, I just like coffee, you know Is this hot water? I took the pre-existing coffee poured new coffee do it now. Have you I don't use too much coffee He uses a lot of coffee a copy of I don't know if I don't know if it was just the one time I might be a little bit strong, but I follow the directions Stamper when it's 10 cups coffee. I use 10 tablespoons. Yeah, they might be heaping tablespoons But I still still the rule no snapper. You don't understand, you know, it's not the amount of Spoons of coffee you put in that makes the more coffee It's the amount of water that's put in that dictates the amount of coffee Let me tell you how you you showed me how you make coffee you said yeah You see what I do I just put a grounds in the filter and I make it a little mountain and that it has nothing to do with the water I'm out of water you put in there though that the amount of coffee grow you put in is how strong it is Yeah, exactly you put you put little baby sprinkles in no I do not take some big bite you fisted grab Put it in no it cooks it Pour it into my cup looks like my pee in the morning. Yeah, it's like week I will look and clear It's not a parent okay I could see the bottom of the cup that is that coffee That's I've seen the remaining of the filters of your coffee and stampers. Your is much much much much less than stampers I'm not called stampers taste tastes really good. I like stampers, but I'm just thinking it's a little bit unnecessary to have that much coffee I would rather drink really good coffee for a month than average coffee for two months No, but then you know, you know, yeah, but last night wake up in the morning. I don't want to drink hot water Yeah, I took a sip. I said wow. I like to look at I said did I pour hot water here? No, it's just Niles coffee No, look coffee right 2014 coffee right? I'm leaving no, but okay once I was emptying the filter of the coffee, right? I saw I saw the I saw the like wet filter and it was like imagine this was it heavy Yeah, it was actually heavy that's good coffee. No, no, no, yes, you as close as it was over It's heavy. You know, you see those fucking standard, you know standard coffee filters, right? Yes, it's stampers coffee was like higher than the top of the coffee filter bullshit I swear to God one time it was the one time I saw it alright first of all coffee filters are fairly big Why would they make them that big if you can't put that much coffee grounds inside? I make like a reservoir for the water I make pots of coffee for 10 cups man The amount of coffee you put in the filter does not dictate the amount of cups made it's the amount of water It's a standard amount. It's a set amount of water you put in many people think that means that coffee is good Raise your hands you think never People think now's coffee shitty raise your hand never taste it This is just ganging up right this is ganging up, but oh fuck you wait when you guys Drink coffee do you actually feel the difference? Yes? I wait I I wake up I say I'm not coffee and I go drink my coffee like it's more like Desensitized to coffee it doesn't even really work. No tampered. It's more like not had coffee. Yeah That's what it's gonna say. It's not inside. It makes you normal now It makes you normal now like heroin, you know at first you're like whoa, it's great And then you need it to stay normal. It's kind of like that often you should have Disguise that I don't drink coffee often, but I doesn't I never feel any different when I drink it That's the thing see like it's like I need it And I don't need it, but I'd like it in the morning Yeah, when I get it I'm good to go but then at the same time I could drink like 15 cups and not have a problem I don't mean to sound like it's I think it's kind of placebo in a sense where it's like it's hot It's like when I get my coffee. I'm going to wake up. It's kind of like a thing It's like ritual. Yeah, yeah, exactly. I'm gonna wake up. We're gonna so it's like a little shower Exactly, I was gonna say it's like a hot shower for your mouth. I don't mean to sound like one of those like coffee twats Yeah, I Swat I don't want to sound like a coffee twat But I kind of need it to like function normally instead of like being a zombie for the rest of the day That's why it's only a zombie all day every day coffee coffee my friend. I do but it doesn't do anything It's I'm saying that's because you have that often plus you drink that pussy shit with iced coffee What's the difference? That's a sugar then you break down.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:44.331 --> 0:09:15.837]: 
  But it's the way he does it. I don't know it's like these way to it. It's like practice You know people kind of like put their thing and they do a fake blowjob like that when the way Chris does it It's like there's an actual solid dick there So he stops at a certain point and he keeps going back and forth and he looks you it He looks right the other looks you right in the eyes It makes you want to hit him in the jaw more than anything else he does Yeah, and he gags at the right time to like when he goes out. That's when he's up. Yeah, the only reason I do that It was a emulated. I'm like Chris can do it. I'm good at it. I'm elated. It's show. This is like No, no look step in the eyes. Will you do it?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:47.942 --> 0:08:48.634]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:05.459 --> 0:09:06.775]: 
  Okay, sup sup.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:07.551 --> 0:09:07.956]: 
  You're jacked.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:17.288 --> 0:09:53.215]: 
  What is your fascination with Chris? The only reason I do it is because I woke up and Chris was holding me down doing that to my face and I screamed to push them off of me. Let's do it to your face. I was traumatized. Who's your wiener? That PTSD. But no, the only reason I do that is because Wintour was dating a girl and she got really pissed off because I asked her to do it for me and it made her so angry. What, look you in the eyes? Yeah. Is that a trouble for girls to look you in the eyes? She was just like, I'm not a porn star. Oh man, that happened to me. I actually like, I was like... I don't want to sound like a fucking asshole but like I slapped her in the face with my dick and she got so mad.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:20.832 --> 0:09:22.874]: 
  The only reason I do it is because I'm an imaginary bloke.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:29.995 --> 0:09:30.434]: 
  He's pissed off.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:37.977 --> 0:09:38.500]: 
  Well look you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:38.500 --> 0:09:39.479]: 
  with the eyes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:46.718 --> 0:09:46.904]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:53.215 --> 0:09:57.366]: 
  Okay that I sad to get this because so mad

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:53.940 --> 0:12:33.274]: 
  I slept with my child and she got so mad. I fucking hate her in the face with my fist. It wasn't even hard. It was just like... I socked her in the eye and she went in the floor. Just a little... It's not... It's annoying. It's just annoying. It's funny though. I didn't understand how you get upset though. You're already blowing somebody. So if you take it one step at a time... It's annoying. It's like when you're a little kid and your sister touches your face. So when you touch her face with your dick, it's as annoying as the things kids do. Wait, wait. But it's like one of those photos where girls are eating a dude's butthole out and he farts and he laughs. Oh, you see that too? It's like this is... I'm quitting this industry is the most disgusting thing. Oh man, I saw that dude fuck. But everyone can relate to that though. Because like... Like I could fart... Okay, I've actually never farted during sex, right? But if a girl queefed during sex, I would get mad. Even though if I farted during sex, I would probably laugh. Most girls do queef. I was on the time though. I know. I was always queefed during sex. I don't get mad unless they laugh. Yeah. Yeah, me and Chris talked about this before. What? Yeah, you mentioned that before. What is that? It's cute. If they laugh, it's like, oh, you think something's funny? It's like a guy farting though. It's the weirdest balance. It's like if they queef and they get really embarrassed and you laugh. But if they queef and they laugh and you get really mad. No, because you're like, oh, God. You fucking dick. Yeah, I think it's funny. You just queefed on my dick. You're like, that is so weird. You guys had a discussion about it. It's cute though. But she's like, oh, she blushes. And I have a girl who's like... She's super pussy and she's like, oh, God. It's like the funniest shit ever. But the second she's like... Then you're like, stop! Yeah, the second she's shooting out queef pellets is a problem. Queef pellets? Yeah, you ever see a queef pellet? No. It's like a little pearl. It's like a clam when you come inside a girl. So she's actually like a cough. It's hard to cough after 100 years. Yes, it coughs a little. How much is it worth? Little pearls. Well, probably not very much. But you can collect them if you'd like to. Gotta catch them all. Man, Zach, you were killing this. Yeah. Wait, Zach, you're wearing a pearl necklace right now. It's a sperm necklace. A sperm. It is a... It's a sperm necklace. Hardened queef pellets necklace. Stand up for if there was such a thing as queef pellets, would you grab one? Would you touch one? Oh, yeah. You would? You would? Just touch one? Yeah, as long as we touch that. What would it be? It would feel like a fish egg. A fish egg. No, it's not. No, it's hard. It's hard. It's like a little rod. It's like a pebble like a shoe. You know what I mean? It's one of those things where you fuck... That's like a kidney stone. Chris, would it be like a bubble? Yeah, exactly. It's a kidney stone with a queef about. I thought I would imagine it would be kind of like a bubble. No, you think if a girl saved up enough of those, she could just shoot at you away like a baby girl, like it's stuck on your skin. Or like, you know, when you're a kid and you have those bubble things, you blow. She puts one of those up there and then a big bubble comes out. That's nasty. I know for a fact you all remember this. What was it like the first time you farted in water and you saw bubbles come up?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:59.374 --> 0:10:00.370]: 
  It wasn't hard.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:04.335 --> 0:10:04.791]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:59.423 --> 0:12:00.469]: 
  You see what I'm saying?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:02.207 --> 0:12:06.325]: 
  It would feel like a fish egg.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:07.439 --> 0:12:07.658]: 
  That's what it is.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:08.569 --> 0:12:10.780]: 
  It's like a pebble like a shoe.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:11.877 --> 0:12:12.704]: 
  That's like a kid these days.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:13.463 --> 0:12:15.167]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:21.884 --> 0:12:22.626]: 
  Or like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:28.482 --> 0:12:28.853]: 
  Bye now.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:33.915 --> 0:17:47.942]: 
  I don't remember that at all. I don't remember the first time. I do it in the bathtub still as an adult. If I do everything bad, I do a big fart and I laugh every time. Yeah, once I walked in, I was like, I didn't know we had a hot tub, exact like we don't. And I was farting the... A joke is so overdone. Yeah, now. That was in Lion King 2. It was really? Yeah. Was it tomorrow at Pumbaa? Yeah, Pumbaa was at Pumbaa. When Pumbaa left the hot tub. Not only do you know that was already a joke, but you knew it was a joke from Lion King 2. I don't remember Lion King 2 at all. Simba's Pride, dude. But that song is good. There was a wooden good song. He's missing you. Yeah, that's the only reason that movie was anywhere to be seen. There was a good song in it. What about 2 and a half? It was just a voting poob, but they already gave the movie. Was that 3? Huh? Was that 3? No, it was called 2 and a half. That's stupid. Yeah. The coolant batata. Yeah, they just didn't want to make 3. Because they wanted to save it, like, I think, for a trilogy. Samper looks like Tony Soprano. Hmm? Yeah. You're doing a weird thing. Are you, like, meditating? I'm fucking drunk right now. I am so fucking wasted. You're like a zillion lines in your head. I'm wasted and tired, but I'm going to stick it through this podcast and try to make poignant responses. Okay, here's a good thing we could talk about, because we're all going through it right now. Moving house. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, moving. We're all going our separate ways. To step back, we all live together in a big house. Meez, Ed, Chris, Chad, Corey, a bunch of people. Nile. Nile. In one house. And they are now selling that house, which, if you're renting a place, you're going to have to understand that that's a potential consequence. She's like, get out. So everyone has to leave now. Yeah. So we all had to leave, and we kind of split ways there. We're still in the process. We're still in the process of doing that right now. And this will be history soon, but that's what we're doing right now. At this second. So if you're listening and you're moving, we understand your pain. Do you remember that time we went to set up the electricity for the house? And we were standing, oh, it was the office, and we were standing in the queue, and it was cramped full of people. And I was standing in front of a lady, and she was like, excuse me, sir, can you get your butt out of my face? Excuse me, sir. Sir. And you turned around, and you were like, yeah? And she was like, could you get your butt out of my face? What? Was she really short? She was sitting down, and my ass was like five feet away from her, and she was like, get out of my face! And I was like, okay, sorry. We had no choice, we were standing in line. We were crammed in a room that was full of people. Yeah, why didn't she fucking move? Because she was sitting down on her fucking- Fucking disaster, we had to go down to the city to get the power turned on at the office here. Yeah. It was just this crammed, fucking disgusting, fucking lobby. There was like a million angry people sitting there all at once. It was super hot. And then when the person was like, okay, all you normal people stay here, and anyone who's setting up a business, like, just come with me, and they all looked at us, and everyone looked so angry. She was like, so who's setting up an office? Who's setting up an office account right now? And then we were the only people that raised our hands, and she was like, okay, you come with me. And this brought us to like fucking Willy Wonka's chocolate lane, where everything was perfect and beautiful and nice. Those people looked so mad, dude. There was like, there was nobody in the other room that we went to. It's like, they brought us down to this men in black place, where they set up our business account. It was great. And then they flashed us in the eyes with that little clicker thingy, and they were like, tell me what I want. How do you fuck do you remember? Because I get bills every month, and I always do poods, bitch. Oh yeah, oh yeah, wait. But, wait, are we gonna have to do that when we move house? Yeah, that's the thing. When you move like, all right, so when you move into a new place, you have to pay more often than not, first, last, and security deposit. Let's say you move into a humble place that costs like a thousand dollars. That's not really humble, but we live on the east coast, not the Midwest, where everything costs fucking 300 dollars. Fuckin' up five dollars a month in one apple. But so, over here, like, more often than not, you're gonna pay around two grand if you're fucking lucky, and live in squalor, or three to five grand if you're gonna live in someplace like this. And the biggest problem is too, even if you live alone, it's still about a thousand bucks a month for some shitty cram department. Yeah, so I lived alone, and I paid a thousand dollars a month, almost a thousand dollars a month, but then I had to triple that up, and then I still have to worry about fucking utilities. Yeah. I still have to worry about fucking utilities. What are the worst parts of moving? What are the worst parts of moving is you have to get your fucking address changed on everything. Oh, my Amazon account, your bill, everything has to be changed. That's the fucking thing. I wanted to change my address in the bank, and they said I need proof of address. And I'm like, this is my proof of address. Like, I need to get bank statements to get a proof of address. So your mailing address, though, just go online and change it. Say, here's my name, I used to live here, and now I live here. You can do it online? Why didn't they let me do it in the bank? Yeah, but, you know, you still have to go online, or it'd still be wise to go online and change your address. It's all boring shit anyway. It's very boring. Yeah. Moving sucks. Yeah, it does. This is my first actual real taste of being an adult. With the move, with the killer stuff. There's tons of flies in this office.

To do the, yeah, we're a new test audience to see if we're good enough for stage, and if their act is good enough. So just walk around places. For real aliens. Yeah, yeah, for the real aliens. But the aliens, they think, oh, aliens are scum. Get the fuck out of here with your door noses. They come down here, they test shit out. That would actually explain a lot of shit that goes on at night time. Yeah? You know, footsteps? It's just an alien stopping his feet.

  It'll be funny if an alien had pubes instead of getting like a brazilian he shaved it like a little crop circle He was like doodoo doodoo doodoo So he's in his room naked but he has pubes still Yeah And he has like no shame That's the easiest way to make scary aliens funny is just give him pubes

But it's like what Zach is doing is he's slowly adding more like Nazi ideas. I'm not putting a frog in the... You're kind of are. You're testing the waters a little bit. You're dipping your toes into... Look, some countries still do it today. I'm just saying the Nazis ruined a lot of stuff. That was cool. Like what? Like killing Jews. They kind of ruined that whole phase. Goose stepping looks like a pain in the ass. Why would you want to walk like that? It's scary. Who would... The commanding officer told me to goose step. I really... It makes a cool noise. Even the... Exactly. The million guys goose stepping in use of it. Even the name though, it's like it sounds kind of like a ballet dance or something kind of fruity. A million guys going, whew! In unison. Which sound amazing? Let's do it. Let's do it.

No, I didn't come into the swimming pools listen to me Yeah, I am who's where they're what aliens were not there Don't you what did happen was I got into the pool and I was swimming around and I saw a lady who was Resting her arms on the edge of the pool and she was just sitting there and I was like what the fuck what she left I went over to inspect the area. There was a little jet of water coming from the wall I was like whoa, what was she doing? And I did the same thing she was doing start blowing on my dick. Oh, she's doing it up her pussy. Yeah, holy shit I was like whoa I started coming but I was like literally probably eight and then my dad walked over in the poons like what are you doing?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:18.525 --> 0:40:32.084]: 
  Dude, I saw a portal maybe six years ago. Dude, this is a new way to jack off, okay? Lick your hand and rub the bell end. That's it. Just rub it. Just like it's... I figured that out when I was 12. Everyone knows that shit. Everyone knows it. Why were you... Lick my hand though. I spit in it. Then why are we telling me that this was some sort of weird fucking phenomenon? Jesus. My parents didn't give me a masturbation book. They gave me a book. They masturbated me. Yeah, they jacked me off. Well, the book was about all of that stuff. My parents gave me a book. I forget what it was called, but it was... Essentially, this is what mommies and daddies do. Oh. So they hug each other. Yeah, special hug. And men have penises and women have vaginas. And all the book did was make me horny and more confused. It didn't help. That's also a similar story. One time when I was very, very fucking young, a guy came to my mom and dad's door with a ton of books. He was like, this is the whatever in psychopathy. If you buy these books, you will never need any other books in your life. My mom and dad got scammed and they paid like 200 pounds at the time. Oh, they did the... That's a common scam. Encyclopedia of Britannica. Yeah, I think that... That's a common scam, like an encyclopedia of sales. I was very young at the time, but mom and dad were like, Chris, these books, they will make you the smartest kid ever.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:19.740 --> 0:39:22.052]: 
  This is a new way to go.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:29.275 --> 0:39:32.262]: 
  Well, everyone knows that shit.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:55.735 --> 0:39:56.882]: 
  Yeah, special hug.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:03.413 --> 0:40:04.409]:

  I was very young at the time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:31.341 --> 0:40:33.147]: 
  Do the internet exist at the time?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:33.029 --> 0:42:28.774]: 
  It did not but um I found one book with that had titties in it And I I literally stole it from the collection kept it under my mattress once when I was eight I printed off making pictures of Buffy that were fake that were obviously fake and I brought him into school And I gave one to my friend and you were God. Yeah. Oh, yeah I was the fucking king until I got caught and everyone pointed their finger and they're like it was him, but yeah What you call it? I used to be the kind of dealer because I was the first one who kind of discovered the internet or whatever So I was like dealing out all these like fake porn pictures. I did the same thing but with Mortal Kombat fatalities Wait, really? Nobody understood what the internet was and I was like this is a place where you can get things And they're like like what and I was like how about this printout baby? Yeah. Yeah, I like oh my god I didn't know you could do that I remember this like the year 2001 or something like that and I just like literally I'm not I was doing the same thing with like Fucking deep prior to DVDs. I was a little fucking asshole back in the day I was the first one to discover like torrenting or whatever and he used to like sell like fucking fake torn to DVDs in school Yeah, I was a god as well I was one of the first people that figured out how to download music illegally burn it to a CD and One of my first customers was my manager Walmart and I overcharged him because he was an asshole I was like but he was still kind of cool I used to do that too except like my friend think they started give me like all everyone in school It started give me lists of like 50 songs to put on one CD and I was like holy shit and I still took all the money I was like, oh god, why do I do and I give them like a see that like I mean I give them I did it for street credit and then I give them songs with like five songs on it I'd be like sorry couldn't get the rest and they'd like But they still be happy well then they were still like yeah They get to listen to fucking gangsters paradise or whatever the fuck they wanted. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so yeah Yeah, I don't know what the more or less story was. I don't know either. Yeah, I restore I guess Stories anyways, but I was like a I didn't understand sex. I'm glad you did He used to walk around and I remember when I was eight years old I had

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:03.623 --> 0:41:03.690]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:17.417 --> 0:42:17.586]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:28.774 --> 0:42:31.440]: 
  I had a bathrobe and I used to get boners all the time.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:31.440 --> 0:44:47.976]: 
  I used to just walk around with my bathrobe and my little boner onto the bathrobe and I'd open the bathrobe up and just point my boner at things and hope that things happened. I would surprise the world. Like if my boner. Or catch a fire or something. Like you pointed a candle and just blow up. It was like testing the waters. Like maybe if I pointed it at that and then I'd put it in my bathrobe. That was a key. You were trying to figure it out with what it did. Yeah, and I was so frustrated. I used to just rub my boner on things and I used to get on my own and give me that fucking book. I was a little pervert before I knew what sex was. I was a pervert but I still didn't know what sex was. Me too. Yeah, yeah. We were just both little fucking. And then when I found out what sex was, oh my God. I thought it was gonna be more of a pervert. Things got really, really bad, really quick. Really quick. Yeah, I used to find a, like I had really weird ones. Like I'd find a size about like having X-ray glasses that I could see through only girls' clothes. And going to school and be like, hey, hey, no one knows. I tell you, I had a boner in school. Yeah. I used to get boners all the time in school, dude. I used to get boners all the time. Before I figured out about the waistband trick, I used to fucking pull my pockets up really high but it just looked like I had a boner. I was holding my pockets when it looked horrible. And what, or I used to put books in front of my dick. That worked alright. So waistband trick only works when you're wearing sweatpants and then kids make fun of you because you're poor and can't afford jeans. You could do the sweat. You could do the waistband if you have jeans. Yeah, but you have to tuck it up under your jeans and your belt and it's... Yeah, it is kind of painful. But it starts to disappear. Not if you have foreskin, baby. High five. High five. That's bullshit. It still hurts when you... No, it does not. Your weight doesn't hurt when you match it under a belt buckle and the belt... No, no....medal is......foreskin dampens the belt. You guys are actually talking bullshit. Now, unless the head of your dick is rubbing the waistline... It was like, how short is your dick, dude? It's extra skin, dude. It's extra skin. It's not a layer of... It's a padding of skin. It is a layer of extra skin. It's armor for the dick, dude. Dude, my belt buckle's not rubbing up against my dick head. It's rubbing up against... The middle of the shaft of my dick. Yeah, that wouldn't really help. It helps me. You don't have an extra little layer over the actual skin. You have extra skin at the top where the helmet is. That would have shattered. That would have the balls to touch. That means you put a small dick because... But the helmet's... When your dick points up, it means it only goes as far as the belt, which means your dick is... Did you scientifically discover I have a small dick? Yeah. No, I don't. We just cracked the puzzle. When I get a baller... Good job, team. Good job, straight up, this small dick, Murray. I talk about a baller...

  That's what an asshole is. No, it's the most forbidden part of a girl's body. Because shit comes there. And when she grants you access to that, I derive a lot of pleasure. Yeah, but that's why I feel with facials, because it's like, if a girl lets you facial on her, she'll pretty much do anything. Every girl will let you facial on her. No, they will not. Yes, they will. No, my problem is the facial still looks like a plastic. I'm still cringey, like, Wednesday, like, oh yeah, you know. That's not the same thing as permission. Stay tuned, feminists. There'll be more talks.

Is that a real porno? He walks with her and comes on her leg and just leaves. And she can't move, so she just stands there and she's mad. Don't come on me! That guy likes to fucking danger. Never mind, her life is in danger, but she's just mad that you can't move. Yeah, but that guy's life is also in danger. Dude, it's so awesome. She could kill both of them. Dude, it's so hot, dude. It is so hot. It's so hot and the bonus is, if they do blow their legs off, you get a beauty porn. It's a win-win. I know. He blows her legs off, he blows her lower. Dick, he blows his dick off. I once saw this midget porn where they were all bouncing on the bed having a pillow fight and it was so fucking funny. And then they all started getting dildos and fucking each other. Yeah, I don't know why it was so funny, but they were having such a great time. It was just a bunch of midgets and they were like... Is it a midget or slur? Or sorry, little people. And they were all just jumping on the bed laughing and having the most best time ever. And then they all just started fucking on it. I was like, I wonder what I was doing at that exact moment when this was happening. Like, was I at work or... She was walking around while he's... Or walking around. And could that be going on right now? Of course. There's horribles things going on right this second.

Yeah, but that's the only cause it's funny. There's a girl on Chatterbait called CosplayCarrie where she dresses up as Harley Quinn and fucks her boyfriend just as a joker and she gets so into character. She's like, Ah, Mr. J, you're digging my pussy. She's actually hilarious. And then she's like the funniest woman in the world. And the guy dresses up as like Ronald McDonald sometimes and fucks her. And while she's dressed as someone from Resident Evil and they're just having such a good time. They like, they seriously just, they're just having a funny time. They're like, they're not taking it. Dude, she's gonna be in Disney World when I'm in Disney World. No, I'm not gonna fuck her obviously, but I'll definitely meet her. I'll definitely get like her autograph or a picture with her or something. Ah, Mr. J, you spit in my condom. He's like, okay. He just like, just like, Ronald McDonald. Sweet.

You ever see the fucking Simpsons porn where Homer's impressions pretty spot on? It's pretty good. It's the same cast in all of those porn parodies. Really? Yeah, James Dean, that fucking chick, or all those chicks, they're all the same. The Scrubs porno is actually funnier than the fucking thing. I tweeted that like a couple weeks ago, but I was watching it and it's actually funnier than the show. Yeah, none of those are really badly written for the most part, which is surprising. You'd expect them to do horrible, but you kind of like get a chuckle out of them. That's one of the only ways porn industry can make money these days now. Is porn parodies? Yeah, selling parodies because it's so easily accessible. I saw it back to the future porn once and Marty was like an Indian dude. Oh yeah!

No, I didn't finish my story yet. All right, so, okay, I went in, I tried to just make small talk and stuff and I was like, damn, I'm getting nowhere here. And then one day, me and Shad walked down there, right? And Shad was looking like the fucking unibomber. He was wearing sunglasses, a scarf covering his mouth and stuff. And Shad, we both walk in and Shad goes, I'm not armed, I swear. And then the guy just goes, ha ha ha ha ha. I was like, dude, that's the fucking last thing I think of to try and make this guy laugh. And Shad didn't want goddamn go. All it took was fucking horribly offensive racism. Yeah. That's beautiful. That's human right there. Yeah, but I was still happy that the guy laughed. Shad walked in that place for a time and he looked at the guy and he's like, does this place get robbed off in? And the guy was like, excuse me, yeah, then he just reached in his fucking big little jacket and pulled out his card really fast. I was like, Shad, you're a fool. Jesus Christ. Shad is mysterious. Wait, dude. That's scary. What if the guy fucking blew his head off? I know, because he was, Shad was like, that's exactly the event of events in order. What happened? Oh, but the time he and Shad went there, there was this old man sitting on a chair, this old white guy, right? And this is just when Stamper said, white guys, white people complain all the time. It was kind of in my head, right? So we walked to that shop and this Indian guy, Shad made the Indian guy laugh. I was like, okay. And then this fat white old guy was sitting on a chair and he was going, takes a long time to clean this place. And there was this tiny little four by four fucking shop and he was like, yeah, we have to replace the refrigerators. And Shad was kind of like looking at him really weird. He was like, yeah, it's cold outside now. And I was like, Jesus fucking Christ, white people do complain all the time. That story was going nowhere. I just wanted to kind of clarify.

  Oh yeah, well that I have.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:51.824 --> 1:11:53.562]: 
  Let me tell you about IHOT!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:53.562 --> 1:13:15.270]: 
  Fuck IHOP! Yeah. Explain why. If you want bad service. Samper left his code at IHOP like a jackass and they stole it. They stole his money on the inside at the end. I almost fucking robbed at IHOP. Fuck that. And then did you complain? They were like, sorry, we can't fucking money. They have fucking cameras everywhere at IHOP. Can I just say one thing about that? IHOP, they segregate blacks and whites. This is true. There's an IHOP in Abington, Pennsylvania, where every time we go there- Where I was fucking robbed. The state, the state, the very same IHOP that was robbed at. They have a left aisle, a middle aisle, a left or right aisle. They- well, this happened at least ten times when we've gone there. The left aisle has been completely filled with blacks. Black people. And black people. Well, it was black. It was blacks. Blacks. Blacks. Blacks. And the middle was filled with whites. White people. Now, there have been a couple of times- There are always like whites. White. But there have been a couple of times where the left aisle has not been filled- You just ponder up a butterfly? Yes. There have been a couple of times where the left aisle has not been filled at all with blacks. Where it's been like half full or a third full or like one tenth full. But it's still like one black person in the left aisle, one white person in the middle aisle. It's baffling. It's happened so many times. It's weird. I don't get it. It's so obvious. It's so obvious. It's just weird. It's not even offensive. It's just like, what? It's bizarre. Are they afraid they're going to catch on white diseases? No.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:55.266 --> 1:11:56.127]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:01.814 --> 1:12:02.269]: 
  I'm excited.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:04.885 --> 1:12:04.902]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:08.395 --> 1:12:08.952]: 
  they have

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:10.386 --> 1:12:11.112]: 
  Can I just see one?
