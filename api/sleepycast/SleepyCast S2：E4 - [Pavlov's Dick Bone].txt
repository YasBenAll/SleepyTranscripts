 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:40.414 --> 0:13:25.165]: 
  I don't know. But what we're gonna say was grab a cup of coffee and relax. Grab a beer. Grab your titties. Grab your titties, you big, un-un-do your rough. Fat obese. So what do you guys want to talk about tonight on this special edition of Sleepycast? Talk about different methods of like how you unwind. What's your unwinding? Unwind? That's a good thing. Actually, you know what you said? Yeah, actually, I'm curious. You know what you said was really good the other day? What's that? When you said you keep your shoes on all day. Yeah, this is the thing I did. I tried that and that was fucking great. This sounds very pathetic also, but if you animate all day, you know, if you work on the traditional job or you're unloading stuff or you know lifting stuff, whatever, you go home. Even if you go to college or school or something, you get home. What's the first thing you do? Take your shoes off. Right. But if you animate all day- Take your shoes off. Take a load off. Take a load off. Let your dogs bark. Come everywhere. They let those dogs out. But no, but since we're pathetic obese fucking rotting from the inside losers, we sit around all day, we draw. And so I do everything short of actually fucking putting on a suit. So I put my shoes on. I wear a belt. I tuck my undershirt in. I feel like I'm going to work. It's like you're playing adult. Exactly. Like I'm a child playing adult. You're watching cartoons. And I work on stuff too. So I get exercise. I'm literally sitting down all these. So the whole thing is you draw, you animate, do your own deal if you're doing all right. But you leave your shoes on all day. So at the end of the day, you have the satisfaction of taking your belt off, kicking your shoes off. That's nice. And you feel like you're doing it. Just to really get just to get into the role. Do you come downstairs to make yourself like a pickle and cheese sandwich? No, he does. Leaf case. I have a routine. I say by the water cooler and talked to my coworkers, tell them they're stoked about ISIS. But they don't even exist. They're just there at the fucking fridge talking to himself. I do like the image of Zach getting dressed for work and then stepping outside of his room and then turning around doing a 180. And just walking right back in. Mondays. Yeah, but I have a routine. I wake up and make coffee. But relaxing though. Yeah, and wine. Relaxing and whiting. You know, I'm not a big, I don't smoke cigarettes. I don't. Oh, yeah, this is a good one. I partake in the occasional cigar. It's a nice little activity. You know what? Other people, I feel like cigars have a good air ban and stigma to them, I think. I've never smoked a cigar in a scenario that did not turn into a debacle. Every single time a cigar ends up getting pulled out, it's either like Pico Day or when I was Yeah, or something. It's like I always get way too drunk. I always do stupid shit. I black out and the only thing I can taste is the cigar in my mouth and then the fuck of all my clothes smell like a cigar. I think I'm also fully aware. That's all my fault. No, no, that's the thing is I think fully disclaim. I know. I think I feel like cigars have a stigma of being pretentious or like, oh, you fucking 60 year old CEO. But no, I hate Spiderman. Yeah, yeah. You running a newspaper? I feel like people, it has a bad stigma, but honestly, to me, it's like a glass of wine, right? It's like people, it's like giving a glass of wine to somebody they fucking slam you go, oh, it tastes like shit. It's like, no, you don't drink a glass of wine to get drunk. You do it to to relax and wine to get a little buzz, maybe. I think cigars are the same thing. When Sabrina was on here to do the podcast at one time, I gave everybody cigars and people were like inhaling it and just Oh, yeah. Like a cigarette and they got a cigarette and like, oh, cigars suck. Yeah, no, no, no. You're not supposed to. They're not cigarettes. You're supposed to you're supposed to take a Milk it and enjoy it. It's in the mouth. It's not it's not in the lungs. You're not supposed to inhale it. Yeah. In fact, if you have like some cognac or something, there's a lot in brandies, you're supposed to not only just, you know, get some of that smoke in your mouth. You're supposed to breathe it over the alcohol, let it kind of like sink in a little bit. It's almost like a ritual. You know, it's it's it's the good thing about a cigarette too is, you know, cigarettes, if you smoke, that's fine. But they're like what a four or five minutes smoke, 10 minutes smoke tops. For people who really smoke, it's like two minutes. Maybe so what two to ten minutes to the 10 to five. I'd say for me, like it would have been a four when I say two to five. Okay, so about two to five, right? Cigars could go from 30 minutes to an hour and a half. And that's the beauty of it. It's literally just white on why you just, you know, if you're if you're a total. The good thing about them is the more you smoke them, the better they taste, you know. It's all right. The more you smoke the one cigar, like as it goes down, starts getting better. So yes, you guys have different flavors. You go there. It's like it's like a symphony. It's like as it goes on. It's like one of those Willy Wonka gums. Yeah, it has different flavors. It starts off with an appetizer with some little orange slices and then eventually gets to the turkey dinner. We're trying to avoid sounding pretentious. And I said it's like a symphony. No, no, look, I, yeah, for this clip, we're really so, so far in the fact that that cigar simply sleep with big pretentious. But if you, if you haven't had what I seriously suggest fighting somebody that knows about cigars, a heavy one, because it's very relaxing. Yeah. Honestly, it's like, you know, it doesn't have to smoke a cigar every day or smoke every once a week or something. And again, it's not a cigarette, but it's one of the few things that genuinely just no matter how stressed out I am, or whatever's going on, it just melts my brain. Yeah. If you have an amazing cigar, it's, it's honestly like a high in a sense just because the adorptor release you get. It's just a high. Well, I think there's tobacco. I mean, there's, There's literal chemicals in there that get you there. No, I know there's literal chemicals, but my point is if the taste is so good and it's so relaxing, the, the, just the enjoyment from it, it's like, it's like a good piece of food, I'd say, like, you know, if you've ever had a good piece of food, you like, Or like a steak or something. But you go, oh, like you make a noise. Hopefully, like that noise, but you make a noise, you know, and that's the same kind of thing. So that's, that's, in short, that's the way I relax. If I really want to unwind, what about you? What about you fellas? You two, you two bozos. I tried to take off the shoes thing, but the thing about that was, the thing about when, when you told me that, but the thing about that was, I was like laying in bed all day, surfing the net as, as they say. You fucking laid in your bed with your shoes. And then I took them off. And then I took them off. Yeah. And then your room stank. I didn't really do it. Yeah. Pretty much. It was just my, my, Well, try exercising your shoes, try walking around outside of your shoes, and then you're like, like sitting around. Well, you, like, I don't be literally sitting around the day, right? You know, I was literally sitting around all that day. Well, that's probably why it didn't work. You just had your shoes on. Yeah. I just had my shoes on. That was what I did that day. What do you normally do to relax in general? Hey, let's say you have a long day of actual work. You see, you're stressed out. You go, it's now time. I like, I just draw. I just relax all day and I fuck you. You've been drawing all day. You can't do that anymore. You've done 20 commissions. So what I do after that is just go for a walk. I'll ask you like this. What do you do to clear your head? How do you, how do you update your emotions? Relax. And then I get stressed and then just back to relaxed again. But what do you want activity? No, there's no right answer. I feel like you feel like there's pressure here. There's no pressure. It's like the right answer. You don't have to say you spit around three times. Just relax. You're picking your pants. No, relax. Relax. There's no wrong answer. Well, you stressed out. Come on, man. Dude, we're just asking a question. This is why you're the biggest joking fucking school. This is why the drugs. This is why the girls, you wonder why the girls fucking laugh at you behind your back. You see the girls laughing. Oh, they're laughing at you, buddy. The pack of girls, they're laughing at you, dude. Not with you. For a second, you probably thought, well, they're probably laughing at some funny joke. Yeah, the joke is a little, my friend. And you know something else? The drugs talk about beating your ass, but I saved your ass. You're lucky I'm your good cousin in school. Yeah, so anything that you're lucky, I fucked the hot treat leaders. Anything? Yeah, I did come inside of Sally. So what? Anything to get away from this is what I would do to relax. Usually. Those long walks. Lock my door, go on long walks. It's to get away from fucking Zach. Fucking pestering me. Come on, he's shivering, man. When you went away, the drugs threw footballs in the back of your head with a gym class. Dude, when you tried to climb that rope and you fell to one foot, everyone pointed a lap to you. And then when the coach came in and they were all laughing, everyone was laughing at you. Cut. They were all you. And he just started, he got angry at you. You really, you really called your... And yeah, he said you were disrupting everybody and he made you go do laps. You really called your coach to show up and to be made all the drugs were slapping you, he's never laughed at you. They saw, this doesn't even apply to me. I didn't even go to high school in America. I can't even relate to any of these. All the drugs pissed on you, called you a urinal, put a urinal cake in your mouth. Did they not have jock, was there not like a jock abuse? It sounds like a weird sort of gay point of what it says. Jock abuse. That's got to be a sub. I wouldn't type in jock abuse, poor guy. Something's gotta happen. Something's gotta happen. It was like, hey bro, and they'd have backwards caps on. That are like you're wearing a jock strap and they just like punch you in the jock strap really hard. Punch you in the cock. And the guys would like that. There's actual chords where girls just take guys' cocks and sort of punch you in them. I've seen that. I don't... Oh, they step on them with the balls with high heels. Yeah, I don't... I never hear of milking. I found this out yesterday. Milking is when a guy is all tied up and a girl is like, he's a cow and he pretends he's a cow. And she like milks him like he's an udder and all his comments. He's like, he's just there. He's like sympathetic. So it's like a hanging hand job? Kind of like, I think so. I didn't watch it, but I just heard about it. I feel like if you wanted to be a cow, you could just put on a cow outfit. Yeah. You could save a lot of time and energy. If you had like three or four guys in one cow outfit, I don't know how you'd arrange it, but you could stick four dicks out of that one, that other bag. And then she could just tug on all four of them. That's true. Or you could have two guys with diphilia. What was that? Or is that two dicks? The man with two dicks. Yeah. Does one dick get harder for every other one? No, the famous man with two dicks. He got two big, hard dicks. No, but I think I read somewhere that he can't get too hard. It's hard for him to get two actual big hard dicks. Well, he has to stroke him both at the same time it gets tiring. No, no, but I mean like just blood flow, right? Yeah, because you like pass out. All directions like judged by, is it muscles or is it? Yeah, it's all muscles. I'm aware that the cock is like the penis is not a muscle, but the muscle is attached to the fatty tissue. Is that what determines how hard the dick gets or is it blood flow? It is a blood, I believe it's a blood flow thing. It's like the situation. Right, it gets your heart pumping. Right, right. Which is what's so dangerous if you have an erection for longer than, you know, I got a fucking bully because when I was in like the Irish equivalent of just say middle school, I said there's a bone in your dick because I thought that that's why it's called boner. And everyone gave me relentless shit for that. And I'm sure that 99% of those people didn't even know it wasn't boner. Everyone thought that when they were eight, when you were 14. Well, yeah, when I was 14. Dude, you're the high school, you're driving. You could drive a vehicle. No, this is the reason why all the guys were fucking going in the- Hold on, hold on, 15 years ago. When I was balls in the back of your head. 15 years, quit this in perspective. That is all, that's three years away from going to the shoes. He and your shoes. Hold on, hold on, I have a worse one. No, no, let's really break this down. You are three years away from being able to pick up a guy in a surrogate country and you thought there was a huge bone within your dick. It's called a boner. Why do they call it that? What point were you able to drive? You could drive. I watched a documentary, right, where this guy was fucking a swimming pool and he broke his- A documentary? Yeah, and he broke his dick. So I thought that the fact that you can fracture your dick means there's a bone in your dick. Every time you saw a skeleton of the human anatomy, were you always confused why there wasn't just a bone sticking out of the dick part? I didn't think that far ahead. But when I was eight, I thought that just your dick was called your balls. So I was telling everyone I had one ball and I was just a misconception for a few years. I remember I got doing an interview with my friend over, that we were on a huge fallout. We talked like two weeks because he told me that cats' tails were not part of their skeleton. I said they were part of the spine. We yelled at each other. We didn't talk for like two weeks. My friend said- Just skin a cat and show him to your friend. I told him. I said, hey teacher, tell this fucking bones. So the cats got bones in their tails and chews like it's true. And you got mad and he stormed off. It's a real story. Dude, maybe it was like in a weird religion where they don't believe that. I also offended him. How many bones do they have in their tail? I don't know, but it's part of their spine. Yeah, they're like vertebrae and shit. Yeah, vertebrae. Is that way if you break a cat's tail- It's like you smash a cat's tail with a fucking hammer and a tree. It'll look like Pikachu's tail. Like all jagged and zigzaggy lightning bolts. That's why I smash cats' brains with hammers. They really should expose all the inside. They got bones in their head too. They got bones everywhere. What the fuck is the room for the brains? You know what I realized? Because of Django. Cats literally, all they do is respond to stimulation. There's no like any sort of- It's really going on. It's just stimulation. It's like a jellyfish. Touch, sound, like- No, it's not like a jellyfish. If you go loud, they'll just run. Like there's- They're completely- I've realized this too. There's no forethought to this. Yeah. No, there's- If you look at an old cat, you really get a sense of it. Like he's walking. He's not- When he walks upstairs, he's not going upstairs. His muscles are walking in a direction and he's just not hitting walls. Yeah. And I tell him, until he sees something that catches his attention. Yeah, exactly. He'll walk and walk and walk until he's like, oh, I'll sit there or I'll smack this. And that's all it is. Because dogs have another level of- Like people are like cats are smart. No, they're not. Like dogs have some sort of self-awareness. That is the one thing that weirded me out about sushi and the food bowl. See, the food bowl was timed. Every day, the same two times a day or whatever it was, that food bowl was automatic and would let out the food. Sushi, you could hear that shit from a mile away. She could and she'd know. But it was almost like she never understood when it was going to happen. Like dogs, there's a famous story, a hi-hi-ji or whatever it was. A papal dog. Yeah. Well, there's papal dogs. Right, so about-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:47.282 --> 0:01:48.801]: 
  undo your bra

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:58.015 --> 0:01:59.955]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:44.121 --> 0:07:46.163]: 
  There's no pleasure in dying. That should give the right answer.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:47.142 --> 0:07:51.951]:

  Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:56.832 --> 0:12:58.199]: 
  That's all it is. Because dog?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:13.555 --> 0:13:13.859]: 
  ஏதாவது காத்திருக்கிறாய்?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:14.534 --> 0:13:15.951]: 
  She could and she'd know but

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:23.039 --> 0:13:26.599]: 
  Well there's never was it right so about repetition and whatnot and that's essentially

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:26.025 --> 0:16:42.670]: 
  And that's essentially what this one was about where there was a dog in this Japanese station It's actually stationed named after it But essentially there was a owner of a dog and he would go to the station every day with his dog And his dog would turn around and go home and then he eventually died But then the dog every day would go to the train station I know until all the trains left and then it would turn around and go Future based on that dog. I think it was the fries dog. Oh, yeah. Yeah Yeah, yeah, and it's a very lovely story and it's true and it's not the first time it's happened Clearly this dog understands patterns, you know, like oh every day at this time This is gonna happen and then they do it whether or not that makes them smart Who knows that that's obviously just the ability to recall and you know patterns and whatnot But with sushi is beautiful and wonderful. I mean clearly she recognizes people so that is some kind of intelligence Fucking crows can recognize people. No crows can do that. You know about this No, they did this I saw this thing where these I think was a college campus where they did a test They put like a like a Richard Nixon mask or something on yeah And they harass what your crows and then when people would wear that mask the crows would go fucking nuts different people with this mask Really crows are actually very intelligent for what I know they are they're very very intelligent They like pick up fucking turtles and drop them into cars cuz or not drop drop on the road so they break so they get a little lie That's what I heard. No, it is true. Is it real? Yes, it is They will have to study cars. Yeah, yeah They drop the turtles on the road so they get run over so they can eat it Or they were dropping things on rocks or dropping rocks on things. I can't wait. Maybe that's what it was Yeah, I like your story better though. I could see you could use a rock in a car very similar things those two things Yeah, I don't know where the turtle even came from but there's also There's YouTube videos of like birds doing like basic arithmetic of like oh, yeah Yeah, I've seen owls doing that they saw problems on now I don't know if that's actually their brain understanding what that is or if they just recognize What the one is you know what I mean if that makes sense There's videos of like crows solving like simple problems like in Human human understanding about this right but my point is I don't know if they understand the actual Right, they use tools like it was like a stick to get their worm out or something So my point is this so if it's one plus one equals two they'll know actually good enough times will be rewarded Right, so my point is this shape plus this shape equals this shape. You know what I mean? So I maybe it's more of a pattern. Do they understand understanding of the actual arithmetic, right? So they could do one plus one values right you give them two plus one and all of a sudden they're just lost What is that story of that? Oh, no wait, but I could be wrong The story of the lady chimp who did sign language became a prostitute Okay, I already know already know because she was like she found out that if she fucks the male chimps She'll get that she'll sell a banana for a What What they put their dicks in her and then she'd they give her a banana for them like hey, they feed her it's a fucking Why can't you pick but there's trees everywhere? This was in the laboratory they wasn't they weren't like on the tree Well, who is fucking the monkeys there saying that scientists? Scenario where they prostituted no no she prostituted herself She was like are you telling me there was a black market of scientists giving monkeys bananas in specifically the word to fuck the monkeys Why did the monkeys that you see the bananas she put on lipstick and she was like Give me the bananas

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:42.057 --> 0:13:43.086]: 
  I heard about that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:43.086 --> 0:13:43.255]: 
  all the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:44.790 --> 0:13:45.094]: 
  Go home.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:45.094 --> 0:13:46.157]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:48.992 --> 0:13:50.444]: 
  Oh yeah yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:50.444 --> 0:13:51.945]: 
  I think it was based on the story. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:50.181 --> 0:14:50.232]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:53.202 --> 0:14:54.940]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:54.940 --> 0:14:54.957]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:06.381 --> 0:15:08.693]: 
  Oh yeah, I've seen owls doing that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:25.669 --> 0:15:26.715]: 
  Right. They use tools.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:38.832 --> 0:15:39.743]: 
  –We should USB understand.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:40.874 --> 0:15:42.038]: 
  arithmetic rate

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:43.135 --> 0:15:44.181]: 
  I don't know if these two value...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:49.986 --> 0:15:50.205]: 
  you all.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:50.796 --> 0:15:51.285]: 
  Yoruldu.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:57.647 --> 0:15:57.951]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:18.505 --> 0:16:19.349]: 
  This was the worst.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:24.867 --> 0:16:25.390]: 
  We did it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:43.395 --> 0:20:38.059]: 
  Which meant in monkey language pussy is for one banana boys. I think I think she was one sucky Was she was two bananas equals one fuck and she was just swimming in bananas at the end of the day and all these other guys I was swimming in bananas apparently honestly if I was a monkey, I saw a stupid slut monkey I give her banana fucker and a killer against my banana bag if you were if you were a female monkey Would you just become a slut monkey? That'd be sucking every monkey they can tell and getting their bananas. I think this is a true story I think that's true. You see the video of the monkey fucking the frog. It's a video. Okay, just fuck it It's what I said what happened that time. Yeah. Oh man, okay, so there was one day. We were in our old house I was like look at this video of a monkey raping a frog and then you'd like right in the YouTube You go monkey rapes frogs and Cory walked downstairs and he's like what is this? I go look it's a monkey raping a frog and he screamed at me and got really mad and stormed up the stairs Because I was watching a video of a monkey raping a frog. It's true. He calls it an asshole. Yeah His defense you were watching a monkey a frog Hilarious Monkey rapes a frog like he's like the he was using the fronting Yeah, I think the funniest thing with the video is the fucking frogs mouth is just open is just Pumping his fucking head exactly. It's as funny as what you imagine Exactly how we describe look up a monkey rapes frog I mean, you'll see it and just imagine Cory getting just fucking Furious with that video or me for even suggesting to put on that video speaking of hilarious videos that upset people Zach recently showed me a video of Bill Cosby. Yes now look by the way, can I just say one of the funniest things ever? So There was to be a rapist kind of slipped out over the years Yeah, so there's a girl like in 2003 the early 2000s she was like I'm gonna come forward and say rapist He's like don't know now pay your money, but you can't tell anybody I raped you and he gave her a bunch of money And then she ran it out for raping and he wanted to fucking money back It's not a business to his action bill You could ask somebody for money back after you paid him to say they did you didn't rape them Maybe he paid her in advance. I wish I could have fucking see the phone call. He'd be like I want the money That to me is one of the funniest things ever you wronged me like you rape you How do you yeah, it's not like a fucking bad look for bread you take back to the store You're a rapist or dude weren't people like milking Michael Jackson up to not in the way that I said for can I just say Let's let's talk about celebrity pinfalls for just one second. We'll go back to the book. How's me? What are you guys? I thought that's what Michael Jackson. You did it like I said I thought I never thought he did it until I read the list of books in his library There was a lot of little boy little boy but hold I don't think he molested children in the way that people people you did fuck with a book I don't think so, but I do think that there was a part of him that either It was either interested in that or there was just a part of him that wanted to connect and remain a child I do think there was some kind of like PTSD from his growing up Time at the same time best case scenario didn't fuck any kids all kids are unfucked Yes, Michael Jackson household. He still fucking slept in beds with kids. Yes adult pop star Oh whole beds the whole beds it was like a bed of kittens, but they're still be frowned upon I think he was a little bit retarded though, wasn't he? That's what I'm trying to say a little bit He was like who does that like I think he was innocent. He was like I'm a kid like I'm saying Thing in the definition of autism like you think you're kids. No you think you're a kid or not think you're kid But childlike you're kind of childlike little yeah, what do you know? I was on today What do you know like I think there's a celebrity spectrum right a celebrity spectrum like okay definitely did it right didn't do it What do you know? I really don't think what he out did it? Let me say this. I thought that was pretty I thought that was common knowledge What people believe that I talked to you like oh, yeah, well, no, what do you know as a fucking pedophile? Yeah, that's what that makes sense I'm touching kids you know once you're accused of a pet being a pedophile your that's my order That's my point if what do you have this video footage of Woody Allen fucking his you know a child I'll be the first to say something working Freeman finger his niece That's something you just said. I don't know man. I look at it. No, what do you know? It's a we got so like no cars be has like I think a little Susie

  I'd be the biggest slugger.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:08.337 --> 0:17:09.012]: 
  I think this is...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:12.944 --> 0:17:14.901]: 
  Fuck you, just fuck it. It's the way you do it. Can I say that?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:44.584 --> 0:17:46.710]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:49.849 --> 0:17:50.997]: 
  It's like, humping.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:50.997 --> 0:17:51.959]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:14.967 --> 0:19:15.389]: 
  I don't think

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:27.302 --> 0:19:29.462]: 
  Yeah, I doubt it was dead. No, I think they were just taking advantage.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:41.055 --> 0:19:41.916]: 
  that she should be.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:44.869 --> 0:19:46.557]: 
  I'm trying to say a little bit.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:49.172 --> 0:19:49.999]: 
  That's what I'm saying.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:49.999 --> 0:19:51.990]: 
  I think there was some mental thing going on.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:57.880 --> 0:19:59.922]: 
  Yeah, the Woody Allen. The Woody Allen.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:07.330 --> 0:20:08.562]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:15.632 --> 0:20:15.919]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:19.699 --> 0:20:20.577]: 
  But once you're a cute...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:21.555 --> 0:20:23.175]: 
  That's my point.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:28.035 --> 0:20:28.457]: 
  See you soon.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:39.460 --> 0:27:52.472]: 
  No, but I was gonna say Roman Polanski definitely was and I love I like his movies a lot What's the guys say? Brian's a singer from X-Men? He fucked kids or something But he's a he's gay too, right? Is he gay pedophile? I think so Oh, I think they were just younger. I don't know if they were I think he got legal trouble. I think he had trouble. I think so. Well, then even Billy Joel though He like ended up I don't know if it was pedophilia, but it was they adopted that like 17 or 16 or 15 year old Asian girl And then you know like that's what happened with This is something Jared yeah, Joe foals fucking 16 years. Did you see what child point he had? Yeah, seven terabyte. Yeah, yeah, like oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah the size of it No, I know I know I didn't mean to do little no, I did not see any of the images No, but it was like it was like what two laptops eight salt. It was like ridiculous He had more information or he had more child porn on his computer like then it took to take man on the moon Yeah, it's true. You know more power like honestly I'm sure that's what he loves always thinking when he was looking at the window on the moon No, honestly if like I would have to spoke to for subways good happens Which they did not have like remember at one gigabyte 90 90 was like the size of a room Well, it's bizarre because there is like this whole chain of people associated with Jared and subway that were all caught like his manager or something like that and then his assistant Yeah, even though that was just a fall guy. Do you can't ask? How do you find somebody who has who's also likes child porn? Yeah, that's the conversation Hey, you like to see I think Jared was like open about it like what's the actual way that no, but you can't be well How old were his kids his kids really? Kids yeah, he's not allowed to see him two kids Six or something like that and so it's like maybe he goes to the park and someone's like oh, yeah You got some nice looking kids there, and it's like yeah, I like kids and it's like oh, hey I like I don't know like you got to like somehow warm up into it or do you just come? Yeah, you can't you can't jump into the pool or maybe you do maybe you do but you do it as a joke like man I'd really love to fuck some kids today. Well, okay. Wait, you know what I mean? I mean, I just get I don't know if they're like you gauge like you guys like just get in You know the dad from seventh heaven the pastor guy Yeah, he was also you know you like don't for that too is like wife like recorded him in a therapy session Oh, yeah, it was like yeah like 1975 like masturbated for have some kid. He was trying to get help I released it too. Yeah, she released it. It's like he what he did was really messed up Yeah, but I feel like if you're a pedophile you try to get help you still I agree with you on that Did you see that article recently on salon? Yeah, it was like it was written by a pedophile Well, it was basically like shaming people who frowned upon wanting to fuck kids Yeah, yeah, the whole slant of the article was like I'm real sick and I yeah I think my fucking kids and yeah, it gets me off, but I never done it before and you're the real monster Yeah, thank you real monster for thinking I want to fucking why would I would actually fuck kid and this to me is like like So we go yeah, yeah, I think my fucking cutting my my my child's head off it like feel some things You should keep to yourself like not not even that look if you think about fucking kids for period and that gets you off For real. Yeah, you should not be accepted to society. No, look that that that should be fraught Look the basic rule is there's no gray or sexual sexuality is gray But that if you're a pedophile if you're gay you want to fucking can send the adult But if the if the thing you want to fuck has no consent and it's alive Yeah, there should be no circumstance where that's where that's smiled. That's my issue is like when people when people make their Sexuality the defining feature of their like personality. I can't stand that like you know There's people who are just way too open about it Like you know furries wearing like their asses cut out I don't get big a fight, but I okay with that cuz Most of them are fine. They're not thinking they're not fantasizing about picking up the pickup to play with a fucking right Yeah, no, but no, but you see I'm think I'm talking about like you know people just say like a pedophile is like I'm a pedophile I'm open about I'm proud pedophile. It's like why do that? I don't like just say if I had a fetish where it was Fingering baby or fucking a girl in her period or something. I don't go around being like yep That's me. I'm all about this then like you know, it's like keep it to yourself I think I think that I think the general rule is if the first thing you open up with is your sexuality Yeah, you're a boring fuck. You know, you know, um gay people who had the voice where it's Understands you're a typical. Yeah, do you think that they were born with that voice not born with it? But if you think or I think I think it's do is horrible. It's yourself. I do too. I definitely heard younger kids Yeah, I do not think they are gay. Yeah, who or you know what I mean? I remember knowing my friends like kid brother was gay like before he even knew he was gay and then it turned out he was gay Yeah, I think I think it's a chemical thing. Yeah, my point is like the pedophile thing I genuinely don't understand that that's honestly say, you know, hey, I think about you know committee genocide It's black people, but I know I would never do it Right, it's like you have bad ideas with your head. It doesn't fucking matter if you do it bad ideas are still bad I just yeah and the fact that you could ever spin it as well You're not tolerant of it or you the fact that you could reprimand me for having these By the way when this person was obviously attacked for writing this article the follow-up articles like oh, I can't believe these right We're attacking yeah, these right leaders if I made an article saying hey my big thing is I fantasize Well, if I really get off to right, but I'll never do it. So fuck you. Yeah, but do you know what kidding me? Do you have a bass? This is this was what salon.com. Yeah, my point is still look what's what's really bothering me Here I'm not a politician. I don't know everything about politics, but I think hey get on with it What the the right for a long time had a big lot of people who were super radical and very easy to pick on spot out like radical dudes Just you radical bros, you know, you know the people who thought the earth was 4,000 years old Yeah, I think believe things like that literally think angels are real and think that He said oh and so on and that was like a pretty we can laugh at that But I feel like in the last like five to ten years It's always been there but the left is like actively pushing people the far left is actively pushing people Like me for example into the fucking set of me to completely it's you know, and it's not it says it completely push me But I see people like Jesus is this really fucking what this side is now as you said one time you said it was like a sphere like me Go so far left. It's okay. It's okay. It's a little bit. It's yeah, it's a horse. It's called a horseshoe theory It's a game of Astros you go so far left you come out right or something. Yeah, yeah Yeah, vice versa, but it does feel like we used to call it the horseshoe, but I actually think it is more just a fucking loop It's I think people are just literally just making circles around You go so far left that you're like oh women shouldn't be wearing sluck clothes anymore because that's Objectifying them. Yeah, and then it's like wait wait, so you're telling women what they can wear That's the opposite of your agenda. That's what it's like in the 60s when we walk in our nick with your tits out now It's like Actual characters can't wear the catabooms bigger than a bee and they can't But see it's under the guys but see that what's interesting is that that is under the guise of it's not about women's freedom anymore It's you know video games are always made by men apparently only men make video games Even though they want to be a part of video games But if there's ever a female character that's in any way sexual or whatnot It was only developed by a guy four guys to jack off There's the new link that women do you see that new link thing? Oh the female fucking the female Zoella link thing Yeah, but that's what people wanted right? Yeah, exactly People who screw look these people don't want anything they don't want anything. I don't know what they mean They just want to complain they want to complain right they want to have problems because the second these people listen If you took everything people said it did all of it they would still complain. Yeah, they make a living complaining Yeah, they're not gonna stop. Yeah, you see this is even a simple people like on YouTube who like oranthers when they realize that the rent But they start making shit up. I remember what was the issue with links?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:39.983 --> 0:20:40.439]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:45.014 --> 0:27:45.672]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:45.115 --> 0:27:45.351]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:50.650 --> 0:27:53.400]: 
  I remember it was the issue with link that you're talking about

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:53.164 --> 0:53:19.035]: 
  Oh, yeah, like fucking I think about a year ago. There was this whole uproar is like why is there a female Zelda or why? They're female link this is bullshit They just decided to pull a problem out of their ass and then finally they actually came out with a female link and they're complaining that Oh, it's just it's just link with a fucking pussy. That's it. It's no difference I think the problem was that I go he's look like you had a pussy Yeah, but the problem is that like she's not overly sexualized. She looks like a badass who's a fucking I don't play Zelda But you know link what what does he do? He hits things on the head with a thing He looks like she looks like a normal person But you do realize that if she had any kind of curves like a smaller waist and around her ass Everyone would be like yeah fucking sexualized link So as little kids little kids have very few defining features a lot of kids are somewhat androgynous which link always was yeah And so now that it's a girl at a ponytail whatever it's like and then that's the problem Like I said, it's it's their job to complain It's their job to find problems that'll exist if they if they run us to talk about their careers over I think there's a time and a place to fight for your right And I think that's the biggest thing the boners be look I know it's a fallacy to Divert attention right from a problem and say hey you should be complaining with us There's bigger problems, right? It's your if you're against a vortical rights and you say hey why you fight for this instead this cancer is a thing Yeah, I don't think that's a I don't think that's a valid argument But it is when you're pointing out non issues. Yeah, I've always thought of it like this Legalizing weed and stuff. No, not even that because that's an actual thing. I don't give a shit. You talk about fight for Okay, but what might actually gets raped by somebody then you know what that's something to talk about right? Linkal is really just a recolor of link with a ponytail that is not something If you if you if you spend your career arguing about what Samus wears in Super Smash Brothers your outer problems Yes, that's it. Yes, people. I mean, you know Look at that people women at Afghanistan look at actual women who are oppressed Yeah, it fucking stowed or killed or forced to marry the rapist or you know It just things like that they have acid through other faces if they try to go to college when I was living in Malaysia though They were a lot better, but they they were still dealing with certain issues There were some more domestic ones like my mom couldn't work and that that really that took a toll on my mom at the time And I think it really changed her outlook on a lot of things. She's naturally a very Productive person loves to work So her not being able to work was a serious blow to just who she was as a person Right, and then while I was also in Malaysia There was a number of cases where girls would get off planes with jeans They were wearing jeans and they got shot at the airport shot. Oh, it's straight up shot and killed So there's clearly plenty of actual issues Right that you know as guys who are very Misogynistic in our jokings and whatnot still absolutely Cherish and respect the human spirit and and believe in in dignity and respect it's dude I honestly think this even it's a little bit topical, but I think it is it's been a growing thing I keep seeing things in the news about college campuses Yeah, having issues with like the Missouri College campus head of what happened. We're essentially I mean, I think the gist of it was a college professor put out a big email saying this is Yale, right? This this was Yale. I believe you know, yeah, one of the professors to my knowledge put out an email saying so I guess the college or somebody within the college put originally put an email saying don't dress with this for Halloween This is offensive. I I know so that was either the college or whatever But then a professor responded and said people should dress how they want to it's college. It's free speech It's we shouldn't coddle and cradle and baby people It's this is the colleges where you learned about the real world the real world doesn't have safe zones and trigger warnings And there's a video of this girl. That's where the students screaming at this fucking guy Yeah, there was a petition created to get this guy fired They're trying to ruin this guy's livelihood just because he said people should dress as what they want to for Halloween, right? Yeah, I just there was no similarly. Did you see that safe zone video? I think I see like it to me where it was like those that group of people that there was like a mixed-race group of people They're all hanging out in like a library or a or a foyer or something like that and There are signs that say hey, this is a safe place safe place safe zone or whatever And people were going into the circle with a microphone and they were kind of like telling their stories about like race and about you know Like yes, yes Everybody's talking everyone's clapping it's hugging and good-spirited and then she picks up the mic and she speaks like very broken English Like she clearly she's actually from yeah country and she's happy to be in America And she's happy to be in college getting an education and it's and it's great And she tells the story about how not all white people are bad and that black people can also be Still the story why she said she was crossing the street with her friend Yeah, and a driver a black person almost hit her Yeah, get the fuck out or go back to a country or something right? We should cross the road a white woman pulled over and said are you okay? How are you doing right and she said well the point of this story is that not all black people are racist but black people can be racist too That's all she said they can't be racist bad eggs and every fun and then everybody in the kind of audience So they're looking each other get away dead. Can't key what I think when people grab the like yeah Yeah, just literally just grab the little censorship like there was a girl too. It was like a girl like you know She said yeah, we get it. She's like and she looked at it all like bitchy She was like, but it's like I think the problem too is that the internet is such a powerful Megaphone for certain things to occur and things like gaming and whatnot You know most of the people who like video games are probably on the internet as well And they're probably pretty active on the internet just because you know They spend a lot of time on it and so even you start seeing it in the news too where they start picking up on all this gaming related stuff so if there's any hot topic right like rape or Feminism or whatnot if there's a way for people to tie it into games It happens to get a whole lot more attention and I don't think people are unaware of this I think there's actually quite a few people like legitimate feminists who are fighting the fight the good fight But they see all the attention going to that to these things and they're like what the hell do you have to do? To actually get some eyes on this to actually get some people interested in this But the problem being that these people are just making it a farce. It's just a big caricature You know, it's like the biggest argument I always see is people who say well, you know, maybe these are kids You know the facts right but at least he's starting a conversation. That's what they always say They're starting a conversation, you know, it's a good thing. It's like well, maybe all white people aren't racist But they're starting a conversation needs to be had right. It's like no It's like let's say apples cause cancer is to make to bring cancer list It's like well at least there at least a brain cancer list Everyone's gonna spend all the right, you know, their time in the research saying no apples don't cause cancer Here's why and then you completely waste all your time waste all the energy waste all the buzz and in the meantime You've embedded a misconception absolutely And then it becomes you can't a take good because very hard to you know separate those two things Yeah, it becomes its own weird sub logic and especially Especially when it comes to like some of these circles of people because they only read articles that reinforce what they already think They only retweet things like if there's misinformation They will happily share it amongst themselves and for their followers to read as well and they will block out anything that says otherwise It's like the Russian media. It really is No, it's fucking it's like it's like propaganda. It's just propaganda A lot of people will just say things purposely that they know is not true just so they can feel better about it They prefer feeling good. Yeah, feeling right to feeling to the actual truth. It's true exactly They're happy with themselves. No because I think they genuinely think the world is constantly out to get them I think it's just it's just a victim complex in the sense where now Do you think all of them are or do you think it's like most movements where the few? Leaders believe it and then they suck in other people that are more I mean in this case, there's a lot of very influential people they get sucked in Well, the thing about that is a lot of people a lot of the bigger people You know Joss Whedon for example who got sucked in and spat right back out But the funny thing about that yeah, exactly They got spat back up with a funny thing is when people like Joss Whedon enter a movie like that There's a good chance they did not really do it at all They just because look we we're so used to because we work online we see Twitter and Facebook every day So we're used to the salon articles of like they're there but if you're some person who never goes online You see article like women should be better represented if you give us a yeah, yeah So that's a true statement. Yeah, sure, but then you don't see this entire. That's just the fucking That's the crusty service. You don't see the big fucking underbelly of right Defending pedophiles and all these are the horrible things right and I think that's what people get like that gets sucked in But like the idea of feminism is good. You know equality Absolutely, dude. I love the idea. I think the idea is awesome and you know I thought is that that's what feminism was and I'd be a feminist Absolutely, I you know what I consider myself. I do consider myself Oh, yeah, if the definition is what the definition You talk about like a like a first-wave feminist right like that that is third absolutely first-wave feminist Take out your titties. What about burn that bra? Don't walk around naked shake your ass in my face Don't shave your armpit be proud and loud and be yourself. You want women to shave their armpits? Yeah I'm so sick of this fucking thing. It's like why should I shave my armpits? Why should I guy shave their fucking faces every day? Fuck you. I shave my balls and my ass and my pubes. All right. It's fucking hygiene. You baby. Stop it You're not you're not being right. I'm not the edgy revolutionary. Why don't you not make your statement? You're being fucking unhygienic. No, I'm gonna just I look I've been with people that had Harry Barts Like Harry legs and Harry pits and everything and it's not But I have no qualms with If you want to be hairy because it makes you feel good fine But if you do need to make a message you're a fucking oh, no, how fucking dumb idiot every society is not just fucking subject women Impressive in the shaping they pressure everybody guys with big fucking nasty pewpears. Yeah, I says yeah You have you leave your fucking out of this. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I said, too They fucking go to the beach. Oh, how do pubes know when to stop growing? They don't mind. Do you mind? Do it? When are they like? Yeah, this is a good length What are you talking about? Keep growing like a Gandalf beard. They stop. If I didn't know they don't I know what you mean. I think I think like four or five inches. I didn't shave mine from the age of 13 When I got my first little pubic pubic. I was a late bloomer to the age of 21 I didn't shave him at all and there was it was bush, but it wasn't like fucking amazon Gandalf beard It was like a fucking I think it's if you don't shave it a lot I think the more you shave it the longer it will possibly but how do they know went to stop growing I don't know how they know how do your teeth know to stop growing? Why aren't my teeth just growing bigger and bigger every day? How do armpit hairs know when to stop growing? I I don't know beards keep doing it But I'm curious because you Zach you were mentioning about like girls in their body image Are you saying that people are pressuring girls to shave? I'm not saying that peepers saying that people that's I'm saying look Are they arguing that people aren't pressuring guys? Yes. The the argument is why should I shave my armpits? That's just what society wants me to do. It's like no that's what people want you to do because every girl I know are like yeah, it's gross not to shave your fucking arm. Why is it every time I see a poster of a guy in underwear He's totally fucking waxed and shaved too. Can I say this? Can I complain about that? I think I'm going to complain about that. I don't like armpit hair. That's just me. I shave my armpits not to the I don't shave with a clear razor. I shave with an electric razor Zach I'm a hairy motherfucker if I had the choice to literally have all my body hair removed I'd take it in a second really I personally do not like having as much body hair as I have I've heard you know, I'm pretty hairless. I don't have any chest hair I should have been hairless because I'm fucking asian, but apparently I'm not you got hair everywhere except for your head It's right. Thanks Now damn god, you're like a fucking eight-year-old walking up to steven hawking like your your head's bent backwards Did you sleep in a chair? Do you think steven hawk? How do you think steven hawking can play check? You talk like a robot. Do you think steven hawking? Why are you retarded lucky? Why do you have computer bands? What if steven hawking was in a room where they were playing chinese whispers? Do you think you'd be able to play? What the fuck is chinese whispers? It's when when there's someone sitting next to you. Is it for your uncle's games that he whispers into your asshole? You whisper in their ears. You whisper in their ear and they say something like the cat is on the wall and then and then at the end it's like Oh, it's telephone. Do you telephone? Chinese whispers? What the fuck are you talking about? There's a rat on my ball like you know the cat is on the wall. Yes, yes, telephone. What about or chinese whispers? Do you think he can whisper? How does he tell a secret? Hello I am gay. Hello, L. Do you think he's only smart because he's like always online like on the internet on his computer? People are always big. Yeah, he just googles all the answers. Would it be funny if there was like a text-to-speech program for for the internet and he'd be like googling things like what is the meaning of two girls one cop? Dude, he's... and then it would return like the meaning of two girls one cop. That's the only reason why he's smart is because he googles all the answers. He's teased holy google like average penis size 28. What is the average penis size for 28? It's actually 5.5 in america. So I am just only a little bit below average. It's a fact. Look it up. He's still alive. Yeah, he should have done it a little time ago. I think he's broken the code. Do you think he's like... I'm curious. Do you think he's a corpse on a wheelchair but like the computer's keeping him alive? He seems to be definitely 30 years old. Yeah, yeah, you'd never know. They fucking... they kept lettuce corpse looking fresh for like a hundred years. Yeah, how did they... oh, yeah, they did. If you see the video of him like cleaning out his fucking open body, it's disgusting. Yeah, yeah, they like crack off an arm accidentally and like... They put a bag on. Why did they do that? What's the point of fucking keeping him on display? Um, because he's a... did they do that with Mao? He died in the 20s, right? They did that with Mao for a while. Yeah, yeah, Mao was... his body was... Wait, he's letting it stall on display. I think they tickled Mao for a while ago, but I know he was there for a while. He was there for a long time. His pictures of his... like he died in the 20s, right? I think it was like 24 or something. I think it was really... he was like 21 even. So you can go and pay your specs and be like wow, look at you dead guy. Yeah, but like Mao... Mao and Lenin killed a lot of people. Why is it them that get the corpse that doesn't rot? You know, it's the crazies that really get the crowd going. They get the loyalist followers. I wonder if Hitler would be on display if he wasn't like... Oh, if Hitler was still alive, his... wherever his monument, like his body, wherever it was, would be like a pseudo sacred place. That's why he burned us. That's why he told his people to burn his body. There are people that swear he lived in Argentina and he died... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard that whole word. He died in like the 70s or something. I was watching a documentary, first of all. If you look at like Hitler's health, let's say the third right-in class, let's say there was a ceasefire. The dude was like, die, he had punk. The last video of Hitler's hands fucking like doing that. He was that healthy guy. He had a lot of problems, which I think is funny because he had this image of like the perfect human being. Yeah, he didn't look like... he didn't look like... do you think he was just describing his perfect man? Like his perfect boy? Like he looked nothing like... He blew eyes. The... beyond the physical... Are you saying the entire Nazi movement was his insecurities and what he wished he could be? I genuinely think that was part of it or maybe he was just eluded, but he was riddled. So even if like he wasn't killed, the war didn't end or whatever, he probably would have died within like 10 years of the war. But yeah, that's speculation. But my point is he... he had a personal doctrine that said he was failing. He doesn't watch those documentaries about like the... what would have happened all through the history. Dude, I hate that. I hate what humans... Earth after humans. I hate the fucking shit. But I mean like what if the Soviets like won this Cold War? Bullshit. You have no way of knowing. No. No, we have good speculation. We have a good idea. I'm curious. So sounds like you have one in mind. No, no, no, no, no, no. Like, not even like what if JFK survived? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's interesting because like, yeah, I don't want to go too off topic here and get too boring or anything, but I think it was a fun to watch because I think we do have a pretty good idea. What did they say with JFK? Were we going to get nuked? No, the thing with JFK was like everybody thinks, okay, since he's like now, right, if he would have lived, that he would have had a... he would have been reelected and had a great second term. But the reality of it was JFK also had a lot of health problems, which by the way was pretty much the reason why... in a weird sense, was why he was killed. He had such a bad back that he wore a back brace. When he got shot the first time, he couldn't slip over all the way. He tried to, but his back brace kept him upright, so he got shot in the head. Oh. So he had... he was in terrible health. And so there's all these... He was so young though. He was a... yeah, he was... yeah. But that's... But he was also kind of a guy who probably wouldn't... if he would have lived... This is what I'm saying. Oh, no, he made... he would have made Bill Clinton blush with like what the fuck was going on in his personal life. So historians were saying a couple things. They were saying like, well, either his health record... because the American public didn't... Or his personal life would have exploded in his face. Yeah, there's a bunch of stories about that. What I was saying about Hitler was stressed. That's why he was sick. Mm-hmm. It's fucking JFK. He was the most stressed man in the world. But... and you see Obama, like he had like nice black hair, young face. He looked about 18 when he came and now he looks about 80. He was scared white. Bill Clinton was getting the blowjobs to counteract the act of the 80s. He was getting his dick sucked like every night, dude. Yeah, but that's why his wife, it doesn't count. It wasn't by his wife. No, it wasn't by his wife. I don't know. He was a player, but... He was a... He was a... The biggest rumors that he like fucked me in a row. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Fuck, yeah. I forgot about that. That's true. And not just her, but yeah. Yeah, but there's a bunch of records of like him taking people. All the Kennedy's kind of had that history though. Yeah, kind of a cool family. They're cool. They were a lot of... they were fast drivers and they drank hard and they played hard. They fucking left the body. Oh, yeah, they were in the mob. I forgot about that whole element to it. No, I think the rumors that... I don't think the Kays were in the mob. I think the rumors we're talking about is like... I think they had mob connections though, right? I think it was the opposite. I think it was like one of the girls that JFK slept with had mob connections. Yeah. But the theory is that they did the mob kill JFK. Like proxy kind of thing. Oh, yeah. And actually the Kennedy... no, I think it was the opposite because the Kennedy's were super... JFK and Robert Kennedy were like trying to crack down on the mob to get rid of it. Oh. Meanwhile, they were drinking booze and fucking girls. Ted Kennedy was killing women. Bearing them in the beds, cutting open the mattresses. This is a fucking thing that happened. Everyone kind of forgot about it. They fucking like crashed a car and they let the woman... like didn't record it. Wait, here's this. Ted Kennedy, like the only surrounding brother. Wait, what did he do? He like crashed a car in the 60s. Was he drunk too? Yeah, he like crashed a car and like his girlfriend or whatever died. He just fucking left the car. He was like waiting like a day. He was like, oh yeah, fucking someone's dead. Yeah. And he got a huge shovel for it. But then not really. Then not really. Then he's a Kennedy. Yeah, people keep forgetting. Like you like Caitlyn Jenner, didn't she kill a dude this year? She fucking ran a guy over. He ran... okay, she ran a guy over. But no, but the funny thing is... Wait, wait, wait. I said he... You pulled back, he put the brakes on that one. Like didn't she like... she probably was, you know, out of the media spotlight and stuff. She's like, I'm gonna become a woman. I'll become back in the media spotlight. And she's like, no, everyone loved her. Then she killed the... she was like... Oh, was that in Kardashian's mom, dad? Do you think she regretted all of the plastic surgery after she killed that? What are you talking about? Caitlyn Jenner. Yeah, who's that? Oh, it's like Bruce Jenner. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's... Be Caitlyn... No, she's on the Kardashians, I think, but she's not part of the Kardashians. I thought Bruce Jenner was the dad. Who was the dad? No, she's Kylie Jenner. Or he's Kylie Jenner's mom, dad. I know nothing about the Kardashians. All I know is that the dad used to be like a swimmer or a model or something. Maybe it is. Yeah, no, he was a famous... He was the Olympics or something. Yeah, and then turned into a girl, right? Why do people care so much about this dude on the Olympics? Why does anyone care about the Kardashians? Who fucking cares about the... Well, this isn't groundbreaking opinions, by the way. I know, you think everyone says why the fuck do people care about... I guess because they're really rich and people just want to put themselves in their shoes or some shit? I don't know. I don't know, man. But yeah, nobody talks about the fact that she fucking is a murderer. She killed somebody. Matthew Broderick. What did he do? He fucking murdered. Well, you know about this? He stabbed two kids in Ireland. He's like, oh boy, I'm gonna drive my car and he fucking killed a family. Yeah, he killed a family. He went to Ireland on holidays and he killed a family. How did he kill... Matthew Broderick was a murderer. Guys, the way you're phrasing this, it's like he walked into someone's farmhouse in the middle of the night. I think he flashed a car to a different car. With a fucking shotgun to the kid's heads. He took a day off. He went to fucking Ireland. That's what he did in his day off. Kill a family. That's his real day off. That's how he unwinds. Wait, he's fair of spelling. After a long ass Broadway tour, he hops on a plane. He takes off his shoes. His private jet kicks off his shoes, flies to Ireland, gets off. They have a car waiting for him inside the car. There's just a big old bottle of Evan Williams, some cheap ass American whiskey waiting for him. He's got a cigar. He lights up that cigar. He takes, he fucking down to half the bottle. This is every day off. There's a new family. That's how we unwind. He fucking drives right in the middle of some Irish farm town and just plows anyone who's in front of him down. Kills the whole family. The whole family. Yeah, that's... So all you meant to do is to kill your friends. He's a fucking killer. He killed a family. If you hear that Matthew Broderick has just finished a Broadway tour and you live in Ireland, don't go for a picnic. Not with your family because you're looking over your shoulder. What other celebrities kill people? O.J. Simpson. O.J. Simpson, he killed somebody. He definitely killed somebody. Well, that was such a quote-unquote debatable. He fucking killed a... Dude, there's literally audio recordings of him screaming. He's like, I'm gonna fucking kill you to his wife. He's like, I'm going to murder you tomorrow on the 1994 day. People say stupid shit all the time, but I do think that it was pretty clear. He did it. He totally fucking did it. I mean, at this point, does it even matter? Unfortunately. He's in jail. Other than he's from steel, he's fucking... Do you hear about this? He stole his jerseys back or something? So a lot of his stuff, his sports stuff was like, awkward. Okay, now he's in jail. He's fine. He's in jail. Let him. I feel like no matter what he would have done the rest of his life, he would have broken a lot. Like 1%, they would have like, we got this guy again. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you think Mel Gibson has secretly killed somebody at some point? Fucking the Jews. He definitely did. He killed like, tons of them. Fucking the Jews. Definitely. Do you think it's possible for another genocide day, like another Hitler to kill about? Oh, yeah. Well, isn't it kind of... Yes, I do. Happening right now. I think that genocide will be of men, white men with dicks. Lighted up. How will we be killed? I think... They will line us up, they will chop our wieners off. They'll actually put scissors in all of our hands. They'll line us up, they'll make us turn to the person to your left and chop the guy's wiener off. They'll make us say... And then they'll put a gun in the other hand, and they'll make you turn to the person to your right. Shoot that person. And everyone will shoot each other in a human centipede of brain splatters. I'm sorry for being white is the last word that all of us would have to say. Alright, so we've got some Patreon questions. We haven't hit these up in a little bit. Some of these will probably go through pretty quickly. Other ones, if they're really, really extra stupid, not only will we skip it, but we will point and laugh at you. Just get on with it. Alright. Aaron Dennis asks, Say you guys starred in an 80s slasher flick. Who would be the killer amongst the Sleepy Cabin crew? Their guess was Jeff. I don't know, I feel like you could actually come up like, if you knew our personalities, you could... Because it's always about twists, right? You've always got to have twists in turn. I don't know who would be the killer, but I know Cole would be the last one surviving. Yeah. Just out of shape. You'd be the worst one you thought was going to die. But he survives the entire time. He's like the stoner from Kevin the Woods. I don't know. I feel like... I don't know who... No questions. Who would die first? I think it would be me. Yeah, I think you'd die first. Die first? I'd be the first. That or you... I'd be like, hey guys, we're going to take a leak and I'd be... You'd either die first or you'd die second to last because you'd be the smart guy who was able to like outsmart. I'd be the little pussy. I'd throw people in front of me. And everyone wanted you to die early on. Yeah, exactly. And they all think you were going to last until the end of the movie. I think I have no pride. I have no... If somebody broke into like... Not to get too fucking... But the parents, they broke into the theater. The fucking guys on stage booked it. They did not give a fuck. Wait, what happened? The parents attack. Oh, okay, yeah. The guys are playing on stage fucking booked it immediately. Yeah, the sound... I would have done that too. If somebody breaks into like a... If a guy walks into the convenience store and says, get over to the ground, I'm going to fucking push the lady in front of me. I don't care. I have no shame. I do not. I want to live. But what was the alternative? Fucking be like, no way to jump and save people. Yeah, try to be the hero. Yeah, it was like, yeah, yeah, try to be the... I will shit my pants and cry. I don't care. So we'd like to have you around. You'd last at least in the middle of the movie. I was going to say stamper because he's out of the group. Right, but that's the whole thing is like that was the twist. It's called back. He came back just to kill everybody. Like you wouldn't expect it because you're wondering which one of us it is. But twist... No, the twist would be it was stamper, but then the twist all along is it wasn't stamper. That there never was a stamper. Yeah, there was. Stamper never existed. There's a fuffa-fuffa-fait, dog. There's a ghoul. Yeah, no, I still think Jeff. Jeff would be a good Jason. Just like a brick house that goes around chopping things in half. And you could try to beg and plead, and he just stared dead in your face and then cut you off. I always said Jeff doesn't like when I say this, but I always said he has a heart of gold somewhere tucked away. He does. He does have a heart of gold, but he's got an arm of steel and he would crush. I think we're all just lovely people. Yeah, you know what? The killer was none of us. The killer was we all killed ourselves. Yeah, we all killed ourselves. I'm looking for the killer. It's our depression that's deep within all of our fucking brain. All right, next up we've got Ting Ting Abatu. Are you related? I'm trying to sound Chinese. Sorry. That's like Inkins. It's your brother. Fuck you. All right, they ask, what's the most memorable experience you've had with an animal? An animal. Yeah. What's the most intimate experience you've had? Yes, what is the most intimate experience you've had, Niall? That was the question specifically, Niall, what is the most romantic intimate experience you ever had with an animal? Look how I stared at Jay with his eyes. I saw that he was doubting the Holocaust. And I pulled him, so I pulled the Wikipedia and showed him some facts. What happened? He still refused, dude. Ugh, okay. Dude, he looked at me and I could just tell he was thinking, six million. Okay, I know that it happened, but six million, come on. And I put the cat down and pushed him out of the door. No, but if you rub above Jango's dick, don't touch any of his channels, but just above it, he gets his little fucking pecker just comes like, out like. I saw you do that once when nobody else was around. Do you think I saw you do that when nobody else? So that's a thing. That is not a thing. He was waiting to reveal that moment. It's a party trick. Just now. I held onto that. It's a backlit brain. Yeah, what else did you see? Apparently that's all he was willing to share with the audience. How about you make what you most intimate experience? My most intimate experience? Okay, I'm gonna be dead honest. I'm gonna be dead honest. When I was 16, no, no, no. There was no penetration of any kind, but I will say. What the fuck does that mean? Hold on, hold on. When I was 16, I had a dog. Holy shit. And her name was Heidi. Her. And she was a beautiful dog. I'm sure you think that. She was very good. The thing though that was interesting, this dog actually never lived in the house. She was strictly a guard dog. But she wasn't a very good guard dog. I remember one time though, when I was outside, for some reason, I was looking at her butt and I started getting aroused. So I walked over to Heidi and I started rubbing her butt. You rubbed Heidi's heini? I rubbed Heidi's heini and then I remember thinking in that moment, this is not right. And I walked away. Did you slip a little finger in there? No, not even close. Not even close. But there was a moment when I actually physically got turned on by my dog's butt and I was like, this is really weird. And then I walked away and I could never look at her the same. I don't think she ever knew what was going on. She just had her eyes kind of pointing in two different directions. Yeah, we'll rip the frog. Staring out into the woods. She was probably just happy she was being touched at all because she was dirty and smelled bad. But it was something weird. My friend fisted a cow.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:24.619 --> 0:28:24.957]:

  Yeah, he just Googles all the answers.

  Yeah, just Google.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:03.430 --> 0:40:04.493]: 
  And then it would return like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:04.493 --> 0:40:07.581]: 
  That's the only reason why he's smart is because he Google's all the answers.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:27.494 --> 0:40:30.075]: 
  Yeah, yeah, you'd never know. They'd throw you, you'd kill you.

  Yeah, he didn't look like that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:44.444 --> 0:41:45.456]: 
  He didn't look like it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:51.075 --> 0:41:52.122]: 
  He's like a fiber seeker.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:55.682 --> 0:41:56.003]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:56.003 --> 0:41:57.420]:

  Yes.

  This is what I'm saying.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:12.126 --> 0:43:14.387]: 
  with what the fuck was going on in his personal life.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:18.454 --> 0:43:19.939]: 
  or as a personal life would have experienced.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:19.939 --> 0:43:21.998]: 
  Yes, there's a bunch of stories about that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:21.998 --> 0:43:22.454]: 
  Right.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:25.896 --> 0:43:26.166]: 
  Mm-hmm.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:34.030 --> 0:43:35.059]: 
  He was scared white.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:41.202 --> 0:43:42.552]: 
  Yeah, but that's why his wife doesn't count

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:42.552 --> 0:43:44.526]: 
  It wasn't by his watch. No, it wasn't by his watch. Oh, okay.

  Very nice guy.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:55.613 --> 0:52:58.650]: 
  No, not even close. Not even close, but there was a moment.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:17.466 --> 0:53:17.888]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:20.504 --> 0:53:37.125]: 
  It's not really that big of an accomplishment. Um... If you fisted a hamster, I'd be like, I'll give you a girl's... I don't know, but fisting a cow, it's just the imagery of somebody standing there with a fucking arm. You can walk with your fucking hand out into a cow's ass. It's like a rhino dude, it's a huge fucking animal. It's assholes, huge too. You can't ask me to dare him to do it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:25.870 --> 0:53:26.511]: 
  I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:30.004 --> 0:53:30.915]: 
  What could you fucking...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:37.733 --> 0:53:46.778]: 
  You dare me to fuck a guy? No. Yo, yo, dare me to do it, dude. Dare me to fuck this dude. Just double dare me, dude. Yeah. Bet you think I'm a pussy, but you think I'm a fucking scab, and you think I'm a bag. Ha ha ha.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:39.285 --> 0:53:39.505]: 
  mata

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:39.505 --> 0:53:40.551]: 
  Yo, yo, Jeremy.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:43.622 --> 0:53:44.213]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:47.841 --> 0:55:52.260]: 
  Oh, you got me. You're like, I dare you to fuck that dude. Oh, damn, dude. Oh, I guess I have to go because you're dirty. Oh, god, man. I always like that, dude. This sucks, man. All right, I'm going to fuck this guy. All right, here we go. Mysterious stranger asks, do you remember any funny stories from school of being in detention or being sent to the principal's office? Well, can I start with this one? Yeah. Every, I was on detention every week because I was like a class clown asshole kid that everyone hated, but I thought everyone liked me. So I was trying to be funny. That was the kid who made the cat noise. And the teacher turned around too. Why did you do that? I was just a little shithead for no reason. So I was in detention every goddamn week. Why'd you do this? Cat noise is a fucking bizarre one. Yeah, I don't. I get like called a teacher with niggler or something, but missing cat noise. Oh, I never do that. Not a black teacher. Once I was kicked out of class. I was in the back of the classroom with a mini chalkboard and a piece of chalk. And every time they wrote on the chalkboard, I'd do it too. But like really loud and they'd hear, like they get confused and they turn around and it died behind my back. Yeah, we had teachers that were young, that were just out of college. So they had to have an inspector every few months to like just watch how they teach the class. And every one of those teachers requested me to be kicked out of the class for just that class because they knew I'd like mess. Like I was a little fucking Bart Simpson little shithead. But anyway, we weren't allowed to speak English in school. And uh. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Yeah, we weren't allowed to speak English. Oh, you were to speak Gaelic. Yeah, we had to speak Gaelic. So we had to be. Say Gaelic. No, it's Gaelic. I was a little more authentic here. Gaelic. No, we don't say that. We say Irish. Just Gaelic. But I had detention every week. Because it was on Fridays after school. And I remember one week I was just there in the tension and then they were reading out the roll and they're like, no, your name isn't on the list. I just went to the tension. Even if like I just thought I had it. I just assumed I had it. You were going so much that you were just like Pavlos dog. It was it. I was just, well. I don't really have that many experiences because I've always been very good. If I was ever too drunk or hung over to go to class, I just didn't go at all. So I didn't really get in trouble very often. What? Drunk. Yes. In high school? Yes. Oh, yeah. I started drinking and smoking when I was 14. That was Malaysia. That was most of the people that I went to school with were also doing that. But no, as far as the stories are concerned, when I was in elementary school, I got a time out. For being drunk?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:51.182 --> 0:53:53.106]: 
  I guess I have to go because you're dirty.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:54.389 --> 0:53:54.456]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:05.914 --> 0:54:06.032]: 
  We'll see you next time.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:18.739 --> 0:54:19.701]: 
  What did you do there?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:28.493 --> 0:54:31.328]: 
  I never do that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:32.982 --> 0:54:33.353]: 
  Kijk!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:41.993 --> 0:54:42.027]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:49.671 --> 0:54:49.941]: 
  Mm-hmm.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:27.842 --> 0:55:28.467]: 
  It was it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:40.313 --> 0:55:40.887]: 
  in high school.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:41.612 --> 0:55:41.950]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:53.189 --> 1:09:11.376]: 
  No, I actually got in trouble because it was mainly my stepfather's fault for teaching me a phrase called, it's only pain. And there was a young girl who had fallen off the monkey bars and everyone was crowded around her. And I remember I knelt down next to her and I just, I put my hand on her shoulder and I was like, it's okay, it's okay. It's only pain. And my teacher looked at me very confused and was like, hey, Mac, can you come with me? And then she pulled me aside and explained to me that that was insensitive and that you can't say things like that. I understand the principle of what she was upset about. And I don't, I think it was the idea of like, she's not allowed to cry. Like I said, something that was less than, no, you were like, it's only pain, pain, faith, you'll be fine. See, that was the mentality, obviously, but I guess in elementary school that sounds creepy or something like it, like shut up. It's only, maybe I said it wrong. No, maybe I screamed at her or something. I don't know. Stroker hair while you said it. Yeah, it was like fingering her fucking ear. And that was it. That's the only story. I mean, I've been suspended from school. Zach, did you ever tell the story about when you went to detention because you rode your motorcycle into class that was back when you were always wearing like two pairs of sunglasses and that really bad ass other jack. I rode my motorcycle. The spikes on the shoulders. It's true. It was, it was football class, football and we class. There were one class and I basically rode the motorcycle right in the girl's pussy. She came in silly, obviously. Probably cause my 12 inch dick her first before the motorcycle. Did you ever ride? Basically the teacher said, I do. I wore you with five weeks because he'd been such a fucking cool piece of you tell the story where you wrote it. Your whole motorcycle just back flipped out of window. I back flipped it exactly. And I basically fucked 100 girls that day in that minute. It was a big deal. One minute, one minute, man. Well, you know, they all go with 30 times the age. That's not very long. They changed the school mascot to Zach Kudlow motorbike. They changed this mascot to be laying back with my asshole dick exposed. Girls come over. All right, we're gonna we're gonna bounce through these as quickly as possible. We have the better sweet prince asks if you were dating someone who revealed that they could turn into any person or creature from real life or fantasy, but had to stay that way for a year. Who would you ask them to turn into? I would have to turn to myself so that I would kill that person. So I could finally notice like to kill somebody and the police could arrest me because it gets me. They'd be like, there's no way it's like it makes no sense. I couldn't have killed myself. That would actually make a good plot to the film. And then I could like people would say I'm dead. Like I got my own funeral. Yeah, I turned them into a genie. But then a year later, when they opened up that grave to exhumate, they discovered it was the body of somebody else. Actually, just be a skeleton. They could exhumate. I don't know. They would exhumate. I would just walk around in a different place because I'd be I'd be free. I'd be off the grid, man. I'm dead. If you fuck it, if I drive a hammer through my own skull, no one's gonna do that. You're dating this person, by the way. Yeah, I know. You're a jerk. I guess you weren't in love with them. You're just dating them. I fuck them first and then I'd. I wouldn't wait. I wouldn't fuck with this. Yeah, no, you already said it. You already said it. I wouldn't fuck myself. I'd be a little bitch if I fuck myself. I couldn't do it. We could play the whole time. You'd fuck yourself and you feel so guilty and disgusted that you'd have to murder yourself. I'd kill myself to get her to the shave. Yeah. No, what are you? I'd turn them into a genie. The gene from a letter? No, not that. Genie, just a hot genie. Yeah, I don't know if they actually acquire the powers, though. They just look like somebody. You just the physical. Then you can keep her in the lamp and then bring her out. No, no, no. No, you would literally be shoving a human into a lamp. Like, they're just be blood and guts everywhere. It's a really good cosplay. It's a really good prosthetics, basically. Oh, yeah, they could look like anybody. They didn't actually try. Otherwise, I'd be like, yeah, they turn into a solid gold brick. Yeah. And then I just sell. It's a person or like a fictional. Yeah. And it's only one year after the year goes and expires. I guess I turn them into Lord of the Rings elf because they're pretty hot, right? Yeah, they're hot. If you like the pointy ear thing. And they hide them with the hair. The problem is that if you make it anything to the people, they can't leave the house because people inside just look fucking. They're just glowing. That's all they do. They do glow a little bit. They have big fucking elf ears. When they suck at night, if you're trying to sleep next to an elf and they're just glowing the whole time. Do you like turn that down to throw a blanket over your face? Fucking kid to love. Oh, it's just you. Everybody's sweet. Put her on the couch. That's what I want. You fucking glow. You're like, oh, for me. Yeah. If I was dating someone and they could transform into anybody, I would ask them to transform your old dog, Heidi. Heidi. No, I would ask them to transform into no one. I would ask them to transform into who they are because. Oh, shut up. You know what? They're they're beautiful. They're beautiful. You really have to make a joint hole. That's your real answer. It's 100 dogs. That's all. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something about someone you're dating. I'm going to promise you one motherfucking thing. If you were dating someone and they said, hey, I can transform into anyone you want. It's a goddamn trick question. Yeah. The moment you tell them, oh, I wish you could turn into Angelina Jolie. They were like, oh, that's a great answer. And guess what? Fuck you. Go fuck Angelina Jolie. I'm out. All right. Linus wedgie. Haja all this stuff. Fucking Linus from Linus. Fucking peanuts. You have no one kill you in Blake. I'm Charlie Brown. Fucks your sister. You're fucking fag. What are your thoughts on fucking dumbass headed great pumpkin? Can go suck a fucking a fucking a way, dude. 85% of ride tomatoes. Fuck you, Charles Schultz. Breaking the mic. You you are so looking building seven. It collapsed way too fast debris. Thought yeah, that's a fucking likely story. Bush and Cheney. You're fucking murders. Bush is a war criminal. Bush is a war criminal. So what do you say? Now you got that out of your system. Linus wedgie. Haja all this dead asks, what are your thoughts on Western versus Eastern animation styles and TV shows? Both camps seem to have militant assholes completely dismissing the other. But what are your favorite? Let's see what this dumbass has to say. OK, Western nation. Great. Family guy Eastern. One punch man. The case closed. Family guy is superior to every fucking Japanese family. He's the one punch man of cartoons. But one punch man sucks, dude. You know something else? Family guy is the best cartoon show. And by the way, one punch man is ripped off family guy. Do you know why? Do you know why Brian never actually died? Because he's one punch man. Brian? It was just a dream. They just wanted to get ratings. People watching it again. So they said Brian dies. That's the only reason. Yeah, you know, it's actually kind of interesting because I do feel like, like especially in the comic book industry, I know that's not the animation industry, but I have seen it in some animations that the Eastern influences heavily influence the Western. Like I'm definitely seeing a lot of like the anime style in Western art, even like boondocks or something. Boondocks is great. To a degree. It's a nice little hybrid, but who the fuck cares? Like it's just it. Hey, Zach, what's better? Classical music or classic rock? The real, the real. What the fuck are you asking? The real answer is that both Western and both Eastern have produced horrible content. Yes. And they produce great content. Yes. Yes. That's it. I think if it's well crafted, both camps have definitely kicked out. She like what is Pixar? What's Pixar? Because technically Pixar probably has a ton of Asians working there. And I don't know that. But they've got eight billion fucking Koreans actually animating. Western because it's the style and the right. Yeah. I mean, it's like it's like if you have American people working on an anime, does it make it American? No, it just means that I think it's about art direction in the writing and directing and voice acting. I think that's what makes the show what it is. There's good and bad and not like everyone knows that, though. That's a stupid nippity fucking. It's hard. You know what's hard is that there are so many Japanese anime series that, of course, when a show comes to mind, I'm thinking of, you know, Berserk or, you know, a lot of the old shows that I used to watch. So it's hard because I don't think there was a whole lot of long form. What do you call Avatar? Is Avatar Western or is that Eastern? It's Western, but they're mimicking the Eastern style. Sure. That said, though, I can't really think of any really shitty anime is because I only watched the good ones that people tell me to watch. All right, guys, we got a juicy one here. Just begging for some dramas. You really? Is it down on sneeze looking up at us? This is absolutely just begging for it. Just wants to be fucking. Oh, licking its lips. Oh, yeah. It's good to run. Good 10th birthday party. Yeah, also, just to just to be clear, these aren't the questions we like answering. But we'll answer this one. What is it? Connor Gerard asks a message for all Sleepycast members, which Internet celebrity or popular YouTube, Newgrounds personality do you absolutely despise for how popular they are? Only in G. Potentially someone who isn't super mainstream like PewDiePie. First of all, I don't hate PewDiePie for being mainstream. I like I like I hate beauty. I don't even hate PewDiePie. I think his fans, a lot of his fans are fucking idiot. A lot of our fans are fucking idiot. Absolutely. Guy asked that question. And when you have eight billion fans, guess what? You're going to have 30 million. I think loud assholes that are dumb. Yeah, well, not to knock his question down. But I think the way it was asked is it's unanswerable because I don't think any of us hate anybody for their popularity. He was asking. I didn't even think he was asking who you hate because of her popular. I don't hate anybody because of their popularity. Now, the only the only reason I'll give you like the term hate I never liked, right? Dispise because they got. No, I know because look, the way I've always read it is it's not their fault. It is not their fault. They were doing what they were doing. Even their pandering. That's true. People are so consummate. It's one hundred one hundred percent of the fans. The audience will watch it because without them, they would be nothing. Without people watching, they wouldn't have an audience. They would have that that prank guy who goes around kissing girls and molesting people on camera. There's clearly an audience for that. There's exactly. So many creepy assholes or bizarre, deviance, retarded idiots. And sorry, I'm just I'm not saying that to be insensitive. I do think that the fans of those types of videos have to be mentally retarded. Only for I don't watch somebody go around molesting strangers actually and enjoying it and thinking that either believing it or be enjoying watching the audience. For that people, for those videos are people who have never had an interaction with the fee level for it. Well, I could just walk up to a girl and say, fucking pick up the other fans. Oh, but there's one person I do dislike for their popularity, and that's the spirit science guy, because the fact that he's so popular, spreading this absolute bullshit. It's boring. But even that is not his fault. Look, if he was not there, there would be somebody else in his place. Yeah, there's clearly an appetite for that. He's not brainwashing people. Leaders of group of cults like that. And it is a cult. Don't be mistaken. But leaders of things like that, people who have huge audiences like that, they're not the cause. Now, sometimes they're really talented at riling people up and putting things in a certain way to Jim Jones. But usually it's because people don't have to believe them. Right. If the people didn't believe in spirit science, they believe in the next thing. If they're not following Stalin or following this, you know, it's like. He's doing it. I don't like. I agree. I think I think on it. I mean, that's like saying, I guess, Niles kind of analogy, even though you didn't say so, my analogy to Niles feelings would be that's like saying, oh, this guy is OK, even though he's a drug dealer, but somebody else is going to deal those drugs. So, you know, he's still an OK guy. You can't blame the drug dealer. You have to blame the addicts who go to him. What I'm saying is that what I'm saying is you can absolutely criticize the people on a personal basis. But what I'm saying is it's not 100 percent their fault. They're not manipulating people. They're not enslaving people. It's half and half. They're not. It's it's they're very symptom of the problem, not because of the problem. Fake the prank videos that they know what they're doing. You don't believe that, though. You don't buy that. That's my point, because you're at the audience. You're not dumb enough to believe that people who are dumb enough to believe one guy don't believe to believe the rest. That's why a lot of these big YouTubers who fake 100 percent of their videos, these crazy YouTube pranks for all the fucking strangers wearing mics, they're not they're part of the problem. But the bigger problem is that people are watching all these guys. Yeah. Nobody's educated about why that's wrong and why the people are liars and why they're being scammed. But they're but they're like manipulating the system. I agree that it's bad. But what I'm saying is also the audience as well. That's not purely the fault of Oh, no, no, no, no. Vitally, the X with the fucking they know that the audience will do that. So they're going to take advantage of people. I think they're two separate things. I the popularity is just a separate thing. So it's like when you talk about these things, there are YouTubers I despise and there are fan bases that I think are idiots for following these guys. But my point is that I don't hate it because of the popularity. Sure. All right. Sir Biggles asks, which movie production company do you like and look forward to seeing their next movies, like examples like Pixar Dreamworks or whatever? I'm not really I don't really follow a lot of studios or like a lot of I don't ask a good question, honestly. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. Sorry. Not Pixar, though. Do you look do you like and look forward to that's interesting that it's like and look forward to. I guess the closest thing I have that I'm looking forward to media wise is like Paul Blart three, Paul Blart three could be through the as some season I supposed to be in the work. So I guess maybe that that's the closest thing I have in the center studio. HBO make good stuff. HBO makes really good stuff. Look forward to everything they do. You can work and there's all these specific programs and things that are like that. Yeah, yeah. Studios that make a variety of stuff that I could point to. I mean, even I think there was probably a time anyone could see Pixar and go. You'd be like, oh, well, anything they anything they do is going to be gold. Even five years ago, Pixar would have been the answer to that. What do they think? That's really badly, though. I've seen it. I've seen it. It's not objectively bad, but it's just. Oh, yeah, I didn't see it. Cars three cars. Oh, that was Pixar. Sorry. Yeah, that was. You know, it's so hard, though, with Pixar. Like, I feel bad for them because they kept raising the bar. Yeah, they just kept raising it to the point where they raised it into a corner. Like, what could they possibly fucking do? You had to see it at some point. Well, the last dinosaur looks terrible. But I'm like, I'm just so. Yeah, I just don't like. What was the last really soft one they put out? Like the fucking besides story story besides that. That's a given. The movie is very good. They don't pump out a whole lot of movies. Who did who did Plains? Disney does. No, that was that was just Disney. No, that was just Disney. Yeah, I'm not sure that one was just Disney. Fuck it. Diggs because the airplane doesn't want to see that.

  movies will you like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:01.403 --> 1:09:01.520]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:04.997 --> 1:09:05.587]: 
  No, no.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:06.246 --> 1:09:06.499]: 
  Which was?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:06.499 --> 1:09:07.073]: 
  Yeah, one.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:12.254 --> 1:11:49.495]: 
  That would be Zach's rotten tomato review. Fucking Dane Cook is an airplane. And there's gonna be a green splash. It should he would fight those years and he would look up at the stars and say, what if Dane Cook was a plane? And fucking became real. All right, Puppy Numbly's asks, did you guys have a natural talent for art before you really started animating the illustration? Or did you actually start out knowing nothing and work to get where you are? Me, I was the best in my class, that was it. Nobody started knowing everything. Not one person in the history of mankind ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever started knowing everything. Everybody started so bad. Some people started out on like 1% less bad. Yeah, exactly. I was a little bit better than my classmates, but I was still parallel. And people fucking bring up like the autistic people who can draw like a fucking city. We're talking about like 99% of the population who go into art. Practice makes perfect in 100% of cases. Wait, there's no easy, there's no like tutorial like a watch on YouTube. No, the 10,000 hour rule. Yo, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's good. I mean, it's a people who don't know. 10,000 hour rule means that if you do anyone thing for 10,000 hours, you're gonna become an absolute expert at it. Someone's gonna be like, oh, who did this 10,000 hours. It's like, go idiot, look at your fucking hours. You clocked in binding of Isaac and fall out. That's a very good point. Okay, combine those, you're halfway there buddy. You know, people have invested 10,000 hours into a whole lot of things, whether it's fucking shitting, jacking off or playing video games. So there's no doubt that you can easily invest 10,000. How many hours does it send out? 24 hours in a day, right? Take about like 10 years of like eight hours work or some shit. No, wait, I could be completely wrong. No, it's less than a decade for sure. I'm not even gonna try to do this with that. But like, so if you draw, most people don't draw for like an hour a day. Let's say you do that, it's still a long time, 10,000 hours. You're always gonna hate your shit too. That's the thing about being an artist. If I saw, one year ago, if I saw what I made now, my mind would be blown. But now I think what I do is like, absolute fucking smeared shit on a cabinet. Well, no, let's just make it really simple. Really simply, if you wanna do the math, 10,000 hours, there's 365 days in a year, right? So let's just say you did it for one hour a day. That's 365, right? Hours. 365 hours. 10 years, that'll be 3,000. That'll be 30 years if you do an hour a day. But you wouldn't, because it would be your job. So you'd probably do it. If it was 30 years, you'd probably be doing what? If you were doing five, let's say you did it three hours a day, then you cut it down by a third. So that would be 10 years. And if you're doing six hours, you cut it down, that'd be five years, right? So I mean, essentially, if you're doing something for, you know, a chunk of your day. The point is practice. That's one word. Practice is shit, Tom. And yeah, keep listening to feedback. Never say, OK, this is it. I'm good enough because there's never a place for that is. Though, if you want to be a good voice actor, just watch my tutorials. It'd be an instant classic. Yeah, Chans asks. Any relation? It's fucking you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:13.435 --> 1:09:14.751]: 
  That would be exact-

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:18.109 --> 1:09:19.154]: 
  There's gonna be a green splash.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:34.984 --> 1:09:36.452]: 
  Nio is the best of my class, doesn't he?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:02.153 --> 1:10:02.946]: 
  Ja.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:05.595 --> 1:10:08.447]: 
  I could watch on YouTube. No. The 10,000 hour rule.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:23.550 --> 1:10:24.310]: 
  That's a very good one.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:44.121 --> 1:10:45.825]: 
  No, it's less than a decade for sure.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:02.009 --> 1:11:02.532]: 
  Well, no.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:05.232]: 
  If you want to do the math.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:13.635 --> 1:11:14.040]: 
  10 years.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:16.217 --> 1:11:16.437]: 
  But

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:28.435 --> 1:11:28.722]: 
  Right now.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:28.485 --> 1:11:28.789]: 
  Right up.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:32.502 --> 1:11:33.008]: 
  Please practice.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:50.355 --> 1:13:26.408]: 
  If you guys could have been on the set of any movie or TV show while it was being filmed What would it be and why Zach would have been on Kirby enthusiasm now would have been on some porno set and No, I'm kidding. What are your answers? Honestly breaking that we could be these would be interesting just like the perspective of just see how they do it But I think I do think like I mean breaking bed is so scripted I feel like something like Kirby enthusiasm because there is quite a bit I guess probably be a lot more focused on tedious. Yeah, or I mean, I don't know if you Obviously it's a hypothetical that can't be real But if you ask me if I could just walk around as a person or for one of the set in the crew You're in the crew. Yeah, no you be on set It's like hey, we're gonna hire if you had a choice right now somebody walked up to you They'd two contracts Zach. I feel like you want to be a actor one of the main characters I don't be a fucking big character. I suck at acting fine Would you like to be a secondary character in Breaking Bad or in anything but I'll tell you this much I want to see it happen. You'd have to pick one of them which one another breaking better could be these years Yes, pretty breaking back as I feel like if I met all these because everyone on that show is like really funny and really Really, I think I can make it as myself. It's stutter like sweat fucking and you think if you weren't Kirby enthusiasm They'd make one of you. No, no, not that I make fun of you But I just I look like a fucking loser because there's stories of people like a regular show is they try to be funny It's like, okay, get the fuck off. They do that really okay Here's my joke about the hey what's with the refugees? Oh, so get the fuck out of here dude. You're supposed to be realized to leave. That's what Larry David would say No, but my point is like, you know these told stories about people Some people try to come in with with a bit or try to be funny We're trying to be the funny one. Yeah, I think if I'm like back to the future be fun to be on with it Yeah, like twilight zone be fun. Yeah, I should be a separate twilight zone. You see it kind of happen That'd be cool. Yeah, I'd say Lord of the Rings or

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:12.782 --> 1:12:14.554]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:15.550 --> 1:12:16.056]:

Because, because, after all you gotta do is record, you never have to put on a costume, you never have to put on all the makeup Or like the little sensors on your face, all you do is fucking walk in, you hang out, you have some coffee, you see the guys You do your lines, if you don't like the lines, do it again, do it again, do it again, great, we're good And then you fucking all go to the bar and then I guess, you know, I think it would be kind of fun to just, just for like the perspective of just like looking at it It'd be fun to be in the writers room like this, like the classic Simpsons or classic South Park, just to see Yeah It's kind of a cheesy answer, but I think it'd be just, just for you to kind of observe Eddie Fett and Jones ass Sodomy yay or nay? Yay Yay Wait, receiving or? I don't, didn't say Maybe it's, I mean, I've never gotten anything up my butt Yeah, so I always say it's the no-go zone when they come But, but, I don't know, I don't know The closest thing I've gotten to being fucked up my ass is when I go into the doctor When I wipe myself, well I guess I have been fingered in the ass, I can't even know about that Once, when I was there Was there anything remotely pleasurable about it? No, but here's the thing though, right? Whenever I used to wipe my ass and go a little bit farther, I'd be like, ooh Did you ever pull like a hair out of your ass and go like, ooh No, what are you talking about? What? That happened to me a couple times, yeah You pulled the hair out of your ass and you were like, ooh You mean like it's in your shit and it's all the way up your butt, you pull it out? No, it's just in your butt, like it's just there, it's up here Oh my god, what are you, a fucking woody dog? It's found its way up there Say catch phrase when you pull and I did a shoot back in There's a snake in my butt There's a hair in my ass I just found the hairs in my ass No, but would you ask me to finger up the ass? You know when you wipe your ass and you go a little bit in? It's like, ooh, it's a little bit sensitive? It's like, okay, whatever But the finger kept going, what I thought it was done, it was only halfway there That's how fucking, I don't know how people can take ticks in their ass Oh god, yeah It felt like I was taking a shit by the reverse Oh, I don't know It was very unpleasant Yeah, I'm afraid I'd like it and then you just go wild NileGunWild.com Don't make that a thing, please Ironically, John McIntyre asks, are there any questions you get over and over that you just can't stand?

  Holy shit, look at this. That was just ask how many balls could you fit in your mouth? We answered this question without even knowing. This was the natural progression of questions. Get the fuck over it, dude. Do you guys like it when a girl literally puts your entire ball sack in her mouth? Oh, yeah, I guess. I'm not a fan of when people lick my balls. I don't look. Look, I like it. I'm not either. I would I say what I know like that, but they tend to do not just lick it. They'll like suck the side of it like like a plastic bag. They'll be like, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, listen. I like it. I tell them, I say, don't don't get it. You don't got it. All right. I don't like it. You don't like it. Let's just just like to the get to the penis. No, I never met a girl who's like, no, I love licking the side of your ball sack. Those are fucking vinegary. They have ridges. There's little straight hairs. There's no fucking way that licking that is pleasant at all. And maybe they're into the maybe they're even if you have a ball sack. I like the feeling of you got a beautiful ball sack. If it's good, it's great. You still know good. You know what I make them put? I put my I put their hands on my ball like I make them play with them. Well, playing with them is different and suck them. I don't even like to play with it, honestly. Yeah, no, I don't touch my balls. We scratch it with leave, leave alone. PSA, everyone, don't touch the balls. For balls. Dylan Questa asks, as artists, creatives, what are your guys definitions of a client from hell? What can customers do that make you want to smash your head through a fucking window? So who was the question that was doing it? I wasn't. I was staring that direction. And you were. I was staring right here and it happened. It is big. I hate when people do that. When you staring in a direction that happens to be someone you're not staring. Oh, and they think you're staring at that thing. Get your head out of your ass. I'm not staring at you. I'm looking at Dylan was Dylan was asking what what is the client from hell? What is your definition of a client from hell? What do you mean? It's like if you ever taken a commission and they were a client from hell. Yeah, I suppose. I mean, you know, I've really worked with people in that sense, why they pay to do something. I've worked with people a lot like that. But I mean, I get I work with people who they'll ask for one thing and then you go and you're like, is this OK? Is this what you want? Did you show the story? You want to show everything or show the rough of the art? Yeah, it looks great. And you spend like a week to finish it. They go, why the fuck to do this? Redo this. But to dig it even further, it's when they make comments like that, but they they act like what they're asking for isn't a big deal. So they'll see an entire animation, right? Or you'll see an entire whatever and they'll be like, yeah, but we change his hairstyle. So you do you know what that requires? There's just like a button that you push that changes all the hair of every frame that you ever drew. I love this character. Oh, I guess if you have like some tweenie thing, then yeah, if it's all symbol based, I suppose that isn't a big deal for me. It's not like a groundbreaking thing, but it's like, you know, when people are like, it's for exposure, that's what I'll pay you an exposure. I don't want exposure. So but then that would be a client. Would that still be a client? Would you take that job? Hell, no. Right. So they're not a client, but they would be. How big would they have to be for you to say yesterday? Like, what if George Clooney was like, drop the job? You like Twitter avatar dial? What? What? What was he? How would that be exposure? Like, is he going to be like credit to? He'd be like, my friend now to the file. I never thought of looking up George Clooney on Twitter ever. Drew this picture. I don't want to care. I don't care what he has to say. Who cares what he has to say? I saw up in the air and it fucking sucks. But that's not it. It's for exposure. It's for. But who? You got George, who would he be? What if President Gerald Barack Obama? No.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:17:23.468 --> 1:17:24.447]:
