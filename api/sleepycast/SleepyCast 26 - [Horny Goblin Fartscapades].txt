It was like oh, Benny moto go kicky fast And I was a chef.

  Well that makes sense. I know.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:50.528 --> 0:04:54.443]: 
  I think that's a pretty cool name. That's fine. I know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:54.443 --> 0:05:23.637]: 
  Okay, so enough about the names I back to the back to the exact what's interesting is you said you had to specify Where a vacation is where you do no work another thing that I think is important to specify It's like I feel like a lot of times when we go on vacation, especially with family. There is nothing Relaxing about it because you're thinking about work the whole time. No, not work because it's family. Yeah, it's family family Yeah, you're like the obligation of like going it's like okay. It's dinner time or we get up. It's it's already noon It's like that's very

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:55.810 --> 0:04:56.451]: 
 阿彩

 SPEAKER_04 [0:04:56.451 --> 0:04:56.805]: 
  back

 SPEAKER_04 [0:05:11.504 --> 0:05:13.950]: 
  Because you're thinking about work the whole time. No, that worked!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:14.744 --> 0:05:16.499]: 
  Yeah, it's family stress.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:16.499 --> 0:05:17.072]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:05:22.624 --> 0:05:30.657]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:05:41.254 --> 0:05:49.692]: 
  Vacations to me honestly as gay as it sounds I like the moments where you're driving you have like an hour to yourself Or so the US put the radio on like that. That's like are you saying?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:48.696 --> 0:05:56.155]: 
  Zach, are you saying that every time you get in your car and go for a long ride, you call that a little mini vacation for Zach? I would say that yes.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:05:55.007 --> 0:05:55.446]: 
  I would say that.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:05:56.155 --> 0:05:56.290]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:58.500 --> 0:06:11.376]: 
  Yeah, last time I went on vacation was to New York with my parents and I was like years and years ago How relaxing was it not yeah because they're like let's go see the Statue of Liberty is like cool. No one else does that Yeah, let's go see the Empire State Building. So yeah

 SPEAKER_04 [0:06:10.549 --> 0:06:15.730]:

The last vacation I quote unquote went on, I guess Magfest was kind of a vacation. I mean it's a little stressful, but at the same time again, it's like friends, you know what I mean? It's like you guys coming out for Pico Day essentially, you know what I mean? It's a spend time. And this one especially, I feel like the more times we go to these cons, like the less... We just end up spending more time with each other, I feel, rather than like seeing...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:26.969 --> 0:06:27.441]: 
  Yeah, it's a little...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:27.441 --> 0:06:27.457]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_04 [0:06:41.852 --> 0:06:57.394]: 
  I feel rather than like I think I think I think that is kind of what the point of vacation is to kind of be around people that you like Rather than say a beach or whatever the steering typical. Let's go to the beach I think we will follow people that I know like in a shitty apartment that I have like a beach or something

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:57.394 --> 0:08:11.172]:

  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:12.454 --> 0:08:39.419]: 
  And then the one thing that bummed me out I think the most was not that I'm trying to be a downer It's a beautiful place But the one thing that bummed me out was like you see all these really overweight really grotesque Like from like a like a Sin City movie like just very grotesque Figures that are like very pale and then they have like these 13 year old girls like I was me rubbing oil all over their back

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:35.607 --> 0:08:36.501]: 
  Like, rubbing all the time.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:37.716 --> 0:08:41.192]: 
  What are you talking about?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:40.213 --> 0:08:58.995]: 
  He's talking about all the pervs that go to Bangkok for like sex tourism. Oh yeah, oh yeah. This is in Phuket though. This is in Phuket. So this is all the island. Or to Thailand in general I guess. Yeah, so it's like here these people who just got all their shit swept off into the ocean then their children are fucking, you know, getting like these pedophiles of fucking rub lotion all over their bodies. But that was like the most- It's not as big.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:43.690 --> 0:08:45.445]: 
  Alright, this is in Puketa.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:45.445 --> 0:08:46.440]: 
  So this is all the other...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:08:47.976 --> 0:08:48.702]: 
  Yeah, so it's like...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:08:57.865 --> 0:09:02.944]: 
  It's not as big. Yeah. Have you ever had a 13 year old boy show you? Don't knock it to your door.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:02.404 --> 0:09:10.184]: 
  Don't knock it till you try it. When you do it, I close my eyes and imagine it. It works pretty well. That's a different subject. I know, that is. That doesn't count.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:09:07.112 --> 0:09:07.484]: 
  pretty well.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:09:08.294 --> 0:09:08.462]: 
  I know.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:09:10.200 --> 0:09:20.258]: 
  Nick, someone said about something like burn children into the walls. There was a joke, but did you know if you ever see those like Hiroshima, Nagasaki, like shadows? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:18.081 --> 0:09:34.686]: 
  Yes, that was the Chris set up. That was the reference. Yes, that's what he was referencing. Oh, I see. But I was joking because it's water. Oh, I see. And they all drown. They never get burned. Shadows burn into the ground by the Nansaki guys and they're doing like shapes with their hands and make animals and stuff.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:21.355 --> 0:09:25.675]: 
  That was the reference.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:09:27.582 --> 0:09:28.560]: 
  Boys and they all drown.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:28.560 --> 0:09:29.657]: 
  They didn't get burned.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:09:34.686 --> 0:09:34.737]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:36.492 --> 0:09:48.169]: 
  I think there were any shadows that were like totally an accident. Like a perfect silhouette of a fucking alien. It looks like someone's sucking somebody off, but it was just because of the distance. Like one was closer and one was further and they were facing each other.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:40.187 --> 0:09:42.212]: 
  Yeah, it looks like it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:42.212 --> 0:09:43.275]: 
  Just like someone sucking somebody's teeth.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:09:45.959 --> 0:09:52.776]: 
  was further they were facing each other or something like that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:52.253 --> 0:09:55.628]: 
  It would be really hard to get a perfect silhouette of you scratching your ass.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:09:55.341 --> 0:09:58.058]: 
  Just like this, your leg up like oh. It would look like you were...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:57.400 --> 0:10:01.889]: 
  You look like you were finger like shoving your thumb up your ass or something. It would have been right on your fist.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:09:59.205 --> 0:10:28.568]: 
  Yeah, it would have to be right on your fist in your butt. I've always said this isn't like a joke you thought about. I seriously thought about this. Yeah. Statistically, at least one person farted like one second before the bomb went off. And then... Could you imagine a horror of like farting and having a bomb go off? Holy fuck! Yeah. The actual horror that you experienced that happened? Oh! Imagine you're home working, you fart, and you hear a big fucking bomb go off, you would freak out, dude. That would terrify you. You'd be traumatized. It would almost be traumatized.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:11.507 --> 0:10:11.524]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:13.566 --> 0:10:15.524]: 
  Holy fuck!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:26.982 --> 0:10:41.072]: 
  It would almost be as traumatizing as when Nikki was lying on the couch at the office and she was sleeping and you bent over and literally farted into her mouth. And she woke up immediately screaming.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:10:37.748 --> 0:10:46.928]: 
  She got you won't wait at least let me let me give some comics cuz I

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:42.996 --> 0:10:48.379]: 
  There is no context at any point. I'm in a cycle right about now, okay? You weren't... that was the...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:48.008 --> 0:10:51.687]: 
  Fucking sociopathic were you drunk? No

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:51.062 --> 0:11:00.344]: 
  No! He was horny dude. He had a boner. He walked through with my desk and he was like, Hey, check this out. He went over and he just spread his ass. He's like, Pfft. Here's what really happened. Is that what he does? Here's what really happened. Here's what really happened. There was a lot of this.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:10:57.981 --> 0:11:13.388]: 
  It was 11.30 am and she was wasted. She was wasted and then she passed out of the college and Mick was like, oh, it was scaring her face. She was a rock. She was dead. She was passed out, blacked out. And I was like, aw, she looks cold.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:58.589 --> 0:10:59.702]: 
  Here's what happened.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:11:16.105 --> 0:11:42.109]: 
  So this is an acrobat- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I did not fart it too over up. That is false. But I did get a re-blake. It makes fun. It was a good act. Yes. And I thought, wow, she's really dead asleep. And I looked at the mic and I was like, check this out. And I farted and I got a bunch of- I put my ass right about the close-door face.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:12:29.089 --> 0:12:43.332]: 
  Tell us what the time that you were in the dark dungeon late at night, all these years ago, and you just put your head up and wait behind your back, and you farted, and it said to be grippled to the dungeon, and all the goblins and trolls died, and they felt like flies in the winter, and you said,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:43.332 --> 0:12:50.537]: 
  No, but then she needed to escape so she found a torch and she lit the torch with her ass and she screamed a fart.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:48.816 --> 0:12:51.280]: 
  Stop, stop it. Tomar was there.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:56.275 --> 0:12:59.684]: 
  Yeah, he was a survey officer. No, it's true. I used to be a gob.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:00.831 --> 0:13:06.619]: 
  I found him

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:02.400 --> 0:13:04.004]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:02.991 --> 0:13:20.507]: 
  I found him. I found him. It cured me of my goblinism. That's a good religion. Goblinism is a goblinism. Is this the origin story of goblinism? Yeah, Jaxie was the big bang with the fucking origin story of goblinism. You started goblinism.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:18.499 --> 0:13:19.461]: 
  You started a gov

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:20.507 --> 0:13:24.625]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:24.119 --> 0:13:28.152]: 
  Biggest religion in the world, third Scientology. Do you think? Second Christianity.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:26.819 --> 0:13:44.807]: 
  I think Christianity. Do you think people would still be Christians if Jesus was a goblin? Like that was the only thing different than the whole Christianity. Just that Jesus was a goblin? You can't prove he wasn't a goblin. He could have been a goblin. That's the new theory. Take this to the sciences. The scientists? Goblin Jesus. Was Jesus a goblin? Question mark. Look it up.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:35.442 --> 0:13:35.948]: 
  take your幽이� density

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:47.474 --> 0:13:49.380]: 
  I hope spirit signs prove it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:50.089 --> 0:13:54.290]: 
  Some say when he got poked out of the cries, his little goblin tongue stuck out like a snake and he hissed.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:57.480 --> 0:13:59.742]: 
  Let now, but I will return one day!

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:01.632 --> 0:14:04.467]: 
  He told you that Ash is a fruit in the wind.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:04.332 --> 0:14:07.673]: 
  What? What do all of your stories say? Like a spiral?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:06.171 --> 0:14:07.285]: 
  Like a spiral, like a wind.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:09.934 --> 0:14:17.882]: 
  Dude, if they ended in the Bible, they had like an amendment to the front page like Jesus is a goblin. I would totally be a Christian if Jesus was a goblin now.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:17.882 --> 0:14:27.467]: 
  There could be like a hidden passage somewhere in the Bible no one pays attention to. Yeah like a page 40 because it all gets told. And now our Lord the goblin went forward. Jesus scratched his fork and dog and...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:21.257 --> 0:14:30.454]: 
  Yeah, like page 40, because everyone gets turned on page 6. And now Lord the Goblin is scratched. Yeah, Jesus laid back and scratched his goblin teeth. It's like, whoa, what?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:30.302 --> 0:14:34.437]: 
  What is that? All of the loyal listeners, look through the Bible, find goblin clues.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:34.437 --> 0:14:38.335]: 
  Control F, the PDF, the bubble type of gab, your fight's with shit.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:38.520 --> 0:15:11.444]: 
  We'll take any evidence. But all the words that are in the Bible, do you think one of them is the word goblin? No. Maybe. You don't think the word goblin shows up once in the whole Bible? Maybe goblin. There might be a gremlin or two. I'd be surprised if there was a goblin. There are definitely witches in the Bible, but I don't know about goblins. Witches. Witches. Yeah, witches. I think David went to see a witch at some point to talk to one of the old dead kings, because he's like, I don't know what to do, being the king of Israel. He went and talked to a witch and she revived the ghost of Saul, the original king of Israel.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:39.752 --> 0:14:40.005]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:45.760 --> 0:14:46.249]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:24.150 --> 0:15:25.247]: 
  No Zach, no Zach.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:28.859 --> 0:15:32.470]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:33.715 --> 0:19:50.910]: 
  What do you think is the grossest taste in the body? Uh, what do I, I would say maybe the eyes? I think the eyes would probably taste really gross, because the eyes of most animals taste pretty gross. What about the webbing of your fingers? I think that would be fine, I don't think it would be much better. Oh, stop it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:48.953 --> 0:19:55.247]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:24.060 --> 0:21:37.206]: 
  Yeah, no you seem through the window If it was a commercial airline, yeah, I just I just imagined it just getting hit and then going completely vertical down 90 degrees because you literally have to turn

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:26.997 --> 0:21:28.617]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:40.682 --> 0:21:45.660]: 
  Okay, so first you wave and he's like, what is that? He turns his plane to his nether. He turns his plane to his nether. He's still waving at you and you shoot him.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:21:42.657 --> 0:21:51.449]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:51.449 --> 0:22:00.359]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:21:58.992 --> 0:22:01.455]: 
  I wanted to get

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:01.067 --> 0:22:28.995]: 
  I wanted to get your reaction. How would you feel about a durian flavored pop tart? Okay, here's the thing. Here's the thing. There's no way it would actually taste like durian. It would have to be like what they do with like green apple candy, you know? Like that doesn't taste like green apple. No, it's- Or grape candy, doesn't mean- It's just a really harsh apple. It has like grape candy, it has some sugar. Yeah, there is durian, yeah, there is durian flavored stuff, but if it tasted anything like an actual, like a durian Fig Newton, I would barf.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:05.067 --> 0:22:06.906]: 
  Okay, here's the thing. Here's the thing.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:22:16.491 --> 0:22:21.992]: 
  No, it's great candy. It's just a really good shot. It has like great candy. It has some sugar. Yeah, there is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:30.042 --> 0:22:53.954]: 
  Those are two gross things. You know, I just... I hate to say the description of it if you look it up of a durian and it's very accurate is that it tastes like Sweaty, a sweaty sock filled with old yogurt. Smells like it. Yeah, it sounds right. And in Malaysia there were signs. There were like big X's like at the movie theater. Yeah, the No Durians. Yeah, No Durians. It's illegal in a lot of places.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:32.759 --> 0:22:33.197]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:33.197 --> 0:22:34.952]: 
  He's gonna look- I hate-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:33.687 --> 0:22:34.125]: 
  I do it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:44.807 --> 0:22:46.444]: 
  Yeah, it sounds like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:45.449 --> 0:22:45.567]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:46.444 --> 0:22:47.423]: 
  right.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:50.494 --> 0:22:56.789]: 
  The No Dorians. Yeah, No Dorians. It's illegal in a lot of places. Yeah. Yeah, because it's so stinky. What would you do again?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:56.519 --> 0:23:02.745]: 
  meat. I would do a meat pop tart for sure. What would you do? I said human flavor.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:57.784 --> 0:22:58.004]: 
  me

 SPEAKER_04 [0:22:58.004 --> 0:22:58.881]: 
  Yeah, I would do it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:23:00.754 --> 0:23:06.002]: 
  I said, I said human flavor. Okay. I said it would be human if it would be like bacon or something. What would you do? Finger webbing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:07.268 --> 0:23:11.993]: 
  Finger webbing pop-tart. Yeah, so specific.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:09.074 --> 0:23:09.124]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:09.124 --> 0:23:09.884]: 
  Where is this?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:12.719 --> 0:23:16.110]: 
  Can you elaborate? Yeah, but... Ever lay between your fingers?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:12.786 --> 0:23:12.938]: 
  Take care.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:12.938 --> 0:23:14.879]: 
  Do you elaborate? Yeah, both.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:16.330 --> 0:23:18.507]: 
  Ew, come on. I'm kidding.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:17.309 --> 0:23:52.358]: 
  I'm kidding. You can actually eat that though. No! I still have my finger webbing scene. What would you actually eat in the first part? Apple pie. Ooh. Do they have one apple pie? I feel like they're not. So that's a very legitimate response. It's a little bit counter-sponsed. You know what would be cool is if they did like some Asian ones like a green tea and or like a red bean. I think red bean would actually make a lot of sense. There's surely an apple pie tart, no? There is an apple pie tart, yeah. Okay, but apple pie is just apple right? Well then I'm wrong. If it had the little like actual bits of apple and cinnamon over the top. Yeah, it's a little bit more specific. And what about you, Summer?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:22.489 --> 0:23:24.143]: 
  Who would you actually eat?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:30.488 --> 0:23:31.079]:

And it tastes like a skittle, and I've had it, and it does taste like a skittle, but I can't remember which flavored skittle. Also, it doesn't just taste like when you wrap them all mixed together in your mouth. I guess that's kind of what it is. When I was a kid, I used to do that. I'd mash them into a big ball.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:18.085 --> 0:32:27.012]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:22.995 --> 0:32:24.447]: 
  Why didn't they think of that?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:24.447 --> 0:32:35.837]: 
  Cuz like you just can't die if you're in the Dragon Ball universe you'd be die after you're dead die You'd be a human a human yeah the saints would come to your planet blow it up

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:27.990 --> 0:32:29.965]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:37.592 --> 0:32:44.123]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:45.405 --> 0:32:49.810]: 
  And you can fly. You just have to learn how. Yeah, anyone can. You don't have to learn how to fly.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:48.612 --> 0:32:56.543]: 
  Yeah, anyone can. You don't have to have to have a metaphor. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They use cheap. You just have to try it really, really hard.

  You'll get it but he can't land on the fly

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:54.957 --> 0:32:58.652]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:57.319 --> 0:33:00.947]: 
  10 is the ultimate try hard even grew a third high if I was

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:00.947 --> 0:33:04.238]: 
  If I was a go-kusser, they could fall low with me. They'd break his heart.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:06.820 --> 0:33:07.444]: 
  You could never recover.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:07.444 --> 0:33:09.942]: 
  That would be the one that kills me.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:09.503 --> 0:33:14.110]: 
  Did he gather up all the dragon balls just to wish you back to loving him?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:13.418 --> 0:33:15.325]: 
  You can't do that man, it's...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:14.987 --> 0:33:19.594]: 
  Right if Goku got an erection and you slept it would you break your hand away?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:19.172 --> 0:33:21.788]: 
  Absolutely. But no, but what it like... You have a chance.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:21.737 --> 0:33:28.335]: 
  I'm gonna try you. No, but it's still a cocked. So would it flop or would it just literally just... Which they still...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:27.525 --> 0:33:30.411]: 
  It would just, it would just stay straight.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:30.377 --> 0:33:42.713]: 
  What is the general consensus about Goku's Superman or any other super powered character that comes? Does that shit bullhole out the other side of someone? Nah, it's just cute little cum.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:40.300 --> 0:33:42.494]: 
  I'll get the other side of some of that chick cheek.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:43.472 --> 0:34:13.223]: 
  Goku's come I like to think Goku we never see him training his like kegels or anything. Yeah, he might just have normal Normal gentle abilities Tiny little like tiny little He's a good guy What if that if Goku chef the book look up his ass and clench his ass would have just come out as powder Oh, yeah, we'd share. No, he would destroy it. That's what I'm thinking. Yeah, he would absolutely destroy

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:53.715 --> 0:33:56.618]: 
  That's what I was trying to say.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:58.407 --> 0:34:01.090]: 
  He's a good guy

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:02.744 --> 0:34:02.828]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:08.312 --> 0:34:08.429]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:12.396 --> 0:34:15.636]: 
  You would have tried, smashed at the dust if you wanted to. It would be great.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:15.349 --> 0:34:18.505]: 
  brain. He could just use his brain and smash it into dust.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:18.049 --> 0:34:31.784]: 
  See, we're asking the hard-earned questions while your users are talking about Iran and the Middle East. We want to know what happens when Gokushov's book like upsets. These are the real questions America, why is up? Wake up, people.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:33.422 --> 0:34:43.058]: 
  All right. All right. So this one's an interesting one. This one isn't quite as funny, but I am curious. There are some answers here.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:42.906 --> 0:34:44.188]: 
  Is it thought provoking?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:44.475 --> 0:35:01.604]: 
  uh... it is thought-provoking and i'm curious what your answers are john to me asks as technology progresses uh... don't don't know your future what improvements do you hope come to the process of animation in other words what do you hope becomes more simple in the future of animation

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:52.525 --> 0:34:53.065]: 
  Hold it there.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:35:01.604 --> 0:35:37.632]: 
  I'll tell you what, look, I think in the future, if there could be a program for like basically like a essentially a program where you could do like backgrounds like photos, basically Photoshop or Toon Boom, or sorry, excuse me, Photoshop slash uh, Mega Studio, like a background program, like the line work of Toon Boom, the simple layout of Flash, like if they, if you could basically combine every great feature into one program. So basically if I could switch to a different layer, I'd paint the background, I'd do a different layer, do animation. That'd be great. I'd love that. And the line work would be good and consistent. If Mega Studio, Flash, I had to zoom in really far to get good Flash, ladies and gentlemen. If Mega Studio had a

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:35.455 --> 0:35:39.944]: 
  Good flashlights if you make a studio had a timeline it would be the best one. Yeah

 SPEAKER_04 [0:35:39.944 --> 0:36:02.404]: 
  But I think a good, the biggest issue with Toon Boom besides like that's convoluted is that it's kind of unappealing to look at. The interface is kind of walky to me. Yeah. It's not that fun to use. Toon Boom? Flash has a really good interface and like layout and stuff. But the lines are good. It has a lot of issues. Yeah. I think that Toon Boom has very few issues with bugs and stuff, but it has a disgusting layout. Yeah. So if you could combine all the great features of the one program,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:49.748 --> 0:35:50.457]: 
  She's a really good writer.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:52.110 --> 0:35:53.950]: 
  But there's a lot of issues.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:53.950 --> 0:35:54.017]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:03.788 --> 0:36:04.969]: 
  Be great. I would love that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:04.969 --> 0:36:31.530]: 
  There was that program that came out. What's it called? TVPay? The one that does the in-betweens? I don't know what that's called. Oh, I don't know. Alright. I don't trust it. I don't know. Well, I've seen some of the results and I think Harry was testing it out. Oh, I saw that. Harry was posting it, yeah. Yeah, he was testing some of the tests of it. And it seemed fairly accurate for simple things. Like, if you're gonna do a very subtle head turn or... Oh yeah, that'd be good. But like, yeah. I mean, nothing's gonna replace like, oh, my hand turns in from a hand to a sharp. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:09.525 --> 0:36:10.454]: 
  No, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:15.027 --> 0:36:17.170]: 
  Oh, I saw that. Here he was posting it, yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:19.701 --> 0:36:20.258]: 
  You're going to see me?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:23.582 --> 0:36:24.004]: 
  like a head

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:24.004 --> 0:36:25.607]: 
  Hey, hey, hey, hey. Turn or... Oh yeah, that'd be...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:31.530 --> 0:36:36.289]: 
  Have you guys seen that stuff Pixar was putting out with the 3d 2d?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:31.716 --> 0:36:32.155]: 
  Thank you guys.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:36.390 --> 0:36:42.617]: 
  All of you the paper what's it called there's a specific short film they did with right? Paper boy? Paper man? Yeah, the paper man. Yeah, the paper paper thing.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:39.816 --> 0:36:48.844]: 
  Paper Man? Well, I did like a demo where Yeah, it was showing all the different styles you can do. I feel like that's the future

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:47.207 --> 0:36:52.759]: 
  I feel like that's the future. So it's basically you create a 3D rig but it prints out everything. But then it makes everything.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:51.375 --> 0:36:57.619]: 
  But then it makes everything too. I just want to see 2d come back in general cuz what was the last 2d Disney?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:57.417 --> 0:37:09.617]: 
  Well Disney Online actually continued, well I don't know if they continued but they've been posting, shortly after they made the announcement that they weren't going to make any more 2D features, they started posting these um, kind of Mickey Mouse stuff.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:37:09.212 --> 0:37:11.457]: 
  I saw those, they're very well done.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:10.545 --> 0:37:20.316]: 
  They're very well done. Yeah, yeah, we have a friend that works on those. I love those. And the style is like a really nice mix of modern and old. Yeah, I like it a lot. Yeah, no, it's very well done.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:37:14.579 --> 0:37:15.456]: 
  and like the style.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:37:17.700 --> 0:37:47.164]: 
  Yeah, I like it a lot. Yeah, no, it's very well done. I mean, like in a sense, we're like a theatrical... Yeah, I thought they pretty much said they were never gonna... They did? It might come back. I hope, man, because... What's the future of 2D then? 3D TV shows. 3D 2D. 3D 2D, yeah. Yeah, that too, eventually. Because with 3D, you can make it mechanical, you can have a robot do it, like in the future. Let a robot be like a program. It's all easy to do with that, but with 2D, there's pretty much nothing you can do besides drawing it by hand.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:33.377 --> 0:37:33.495]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:33.495 --> 0:37:36.060]: 
  3D 2D. Yeah, that's 2D 2D.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:42.321 --> 0:37:42.692]: 
  Mm-hmm.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:47.164 --> 0:37:51.434]: 
  I think the auto in betweeners are gonna be a real popular thing in the future.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:37:49.881 --> 0:38:07.212]: 
  Yeah, absolutely. The reason I prefer 2D though is because if you're a kid, there's a little bit like a kid really can't draw a 3D character like a paper. There's something really nice to me at least about a kid watching a movie or a TV show and drawing in a paper like replicating fucking Splunkbub or whatever he wants to draw.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:06.942 --> 0:38:07.077]: 
  Thank you very much.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:07.836 --> 0:38:10.418]: 
  Spongebob is a hard motherfucker to draw.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:38:09.844 --> 0:38:17.657]: 
  Yeah, I know who's one of the first countries I learned how to draw. They have a like Goku, they have a Goku, yeah. There's like weird two characters to pick, but...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:17.742 --> 0:38:37.435]: 
  Does anybody mind the fact that in the Dragon Ball universe all the characters have like two faces? What do you mean? Oh, just the Toriyama just kind of has... Yeah! He has the same face as the guy from Time... Big forehead. Time... Well, you're saying all the exact same... Chrono trigger. Yeah, Chrono trigger. Yeah. He's also the Dragon Warrior. Time gun. Or Dragon... I don't think that.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:38:30.128 --> 0:38:30.685]: 
  time

 SPEAKER_04 [0:38:37.435 --> 0:38:43.864]: 
  I mean why is the shit has a kind of similar thing like ever looks like the Simpsons now for family guy Brickleberry looks like family guy

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:43.847 --> 0:38:54.546]: 
  Yeah, I feel like that's all people who have these distinctive styles that become famous all kind of exhibit that pattern where they They really have a specific way they draw each gender and they don't deviate far from it

 SPEAKER_04 [0:38:44.995 --> 0:38:46.244]: 
  to be your people who have the

 SPEAKER_04 [0:38:54.529 --> 0:39:13.075]: 
  Every show in the 60s from here, from there, look the exact same too. They all have the exact same character designs. I mean, it's just a trend. It's like every ten years a new Reddit Stipty changes a lot of the way cartoons look in the 90s. And it's like, if you're an attention type, there's like every ten years or so a show comes along. They're really fucked with how people draw, which is fine, but...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:13.395 --> 0:39:19.943]: 
  Red and Stimpy was awesome back in the day though. I like that. What, no? No? I like that. I like it. I like it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:18.272 --> 0:39:21.580]: 
  No? I like it. I like it. It's iconic. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:19.943 --> 0:39:20.449]: 
  Alright, it's okay.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:21.276 --> 0:39:21.951]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:39:21.951 --> 0:39:37.307]: 
  I think the one thing they did that I really really miss about TV shows at least that are cartoons is painted backgrounds Oh, yeah, nobody's really done it. Yeah, I mean they we have like nice kind of vectory Even a hand like drunk, but I haven't really seen like a shadow

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:29.781 --> 0:39:31.317]: 
  Nobody's really done it though.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:36.784 --> 0:39:38.168]: 
  Shad was doing those for everyone.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:37.307 --> 0:39:41.273]: 
  was doing those for everybody.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:39:38.168 --> 0:39:39.366]: 
  Have you seen Steven?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:39:40.699 --> 0:39:44.665]: 
  I haven't. Are they like, paid to pay to or are they cut? Is it like, spoiled about where they're cutting spoiled? No, it's like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:43.821 --> 0:39:49.947]: 
  Well, they've got these big lines in the background for sunlight, but they look really great.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:49.896 --> 0:40:46.242]: 
  I noticed in Venture Bros. That's a good show. I was watching one like the first season. But I noticed with the backgrounds, I don't want to say they're lazy, but they're clearly stylistic. They're very simple. They're very simple, but I noticed in one of the... That shows evolved a lot artistically. It absolutely has, but in that first season what I noticed, they were in the desert or something and I realized because of the sand, I could see the brush that they used. And they were just like clicking it around. And then as the scenes progressed, even when they're inside the ship, even when they're in a house they were using the same fucking brush every single time. That weird splot. Yeah, it's like a splot show. Show me that before. Yeah. But I was just like, all of a sudden, that's all I could see, but I didn't mind. Clearly it still works, as far as the show is concerned. But yeah. This question comes from GermanMixbermann. GermanMixbermann? How big is your...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:52:54.921 --> 0:52:57.520]: 
  What was the question?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:57.030 --> 0:54:17.828]: 
  It was the jobs, it was the jobs. Oh yeah. I don't know if I said it already, but did I mention that I worked at a strip joint? Really? No. Oh, I guess I haven't. Were you a stripper? No, I worked as a doorman. Oh, I knew it. Which is slash the initial bouncing, it's like phase, it's like the pre-bouncer. Cause they actually have the real bouncers inside. Those guys got like tasers and shit. In case people go wild on the girls, they need to be like pull them off and shit. But it was in Washington, so it was a dry bar, so there was no alcohol. They had soda and stuff. But my job- Dry bar. That is some sad shit. Yeah, my job ended up being a whole bunch of weird shit where like I'd also have to be the lot guy, I'd have to go and make sure people weren't like fucking or doing drugs in the parking lot. And then also sometimes I'd work the bar, which basically meant I made the sodas clean the glasses and gave the girls candy when they got off the stage. That's creepy. How will these girls do this? Okay, so I ended up dating one of them, which is a really big no-no. I think you told me about that. Yeah, so one of the girls I ended up dating, I don't need to name her. She had two names, obviously. No, but so one of the big no-no's is that you don't ever, ever, ever date the girls. Like that is something. And even after you quit the job, you can't even go into these, it was a deja vu establishment, but you're not even allowed to be in one of those months after you've quit. Why? deja vu. Yeah, well show girls deja vu. I think that was the first strip club I ever went to. Yeah, they're a chain. They're everywhere.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:02.667 --> 0:53:07.307]: 
  No? Oh, I guess I have it. Alright, I worked as- Were you a stripper? No. I worked as a- I was a bouncer.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:27.152 --> 0:53:28.502]: 
  But my job is to do it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:27.524 --> 0:53:27.945]: 
  is no good someone will have for a job in a not

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:27.996 --> 0:53:30.224]: 
  That is some sad shit.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:32.940 --> 0:53:33.599]: 
  have to be the lot.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:53:45.614 --> 0:53:45.681]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:50.541 --> 0:53:53.241]: 
  Thank you for telling me about that.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:53:55.334 --> 0:53:56.549]: 
  Yes, Stephanie.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:12.074 --> 0:54:15.145]: 
  Why? Deja vu. Yeah, well show us. I think that was the first.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:54:17.592 --> 0:54:19.718]: 
  Why aren't you allowed to go back in if you quit?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:19.718 --> 0:54:25.472]: 
  Um, because I guess it's like they think you went to go meet girls or something, so then like you're not supposed to be able to... Oh, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:54:24.679 --> 0:54:28.172]: 
  I don't know. I don't think they're afraid to really like as safe as we come back in. I don't know this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:27.497 --> 0:55:20.282]: 
  I don't know. I mean that might be part of it too. I mean the truth is is after we started dating I quit because the bounces there are fucking crazy There were these two guys who they said every night after After their shift it was like 3 30 in the morning or something to get in the car going to downtown Seattle This was in Kenmore, but they go to downtown Seattle and they'd find bum sleeping on the road and tase them in the balls until they Pissed themselves. Whoa, that was what they did for fucking fun. That's and so when we were outside and they're telling me what they do for fun I was like fuck I fucked up. I need to go. I need to quit immediately and not be here because these are the guys Who if they found out, you know, it's not like the mafia or something like that But clearly the rules are a little bit. They're still a little bit kind of shady. It's a strip joint. Yeah, super Yeah, but it was a really weird. I don't know it was weird Like you do the lot and you'd see like, you know the baby like world's best dad sticker on the back of the minivan And you're like, oh, okay, and then

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:08.284 --> 0:55:10.225]: 
  Yeah, super fuck yeah, but it was a

 SPEAKER_04 [0:55:20.282 --> 0:55:26.121]: 
  Oh, it's a- I always assumed Supercruz were just full of like discruthled like 50 year old man who would get divorced.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:26.121 --> 0:55:47.114]: 
  You know, it's a mix of like young guys, there's a mix of like young guys for like bachelor parties and then there's some older guys too. Um, there was one guy who'd come in who wanted to be, he liked being embarrassed, so they'd like make him lick ash trays and like do all this kind of stuff. Oh exactly, guys would be like- And all the girls wanted him to be around too, because he tipped really, really fucking well.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:55:41.663 --> 0:55:42.220]: 
  stuff.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:55:47.114 --> 0:55:54.809]: 
  Is he one of those guys who like, who makes the videos where sick girls like, like small dick loser? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. What is a pisser diaper baby? It was absolutely that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:51.636 --> 0:56:43.341]: 
  Yeah, yeah, it was absolutely that it was absolutely that and yeah, and then for Yeah, I don't know just in general it was really weird It was fun for about a half hour And then it was like the most depressing thing I ever saw because it was like all these girls You were asking how old they were and there was a really wide range There were girls who were like in their late teens all the way up until you know probably 45 or something like that And one of the girls who was really really nice She actually went because she was trying to pay for college But then when enough happening was is that she got so much money that she got an apartment But then she also got a car and then she also got a dog And then she also got so then her lifestyle all of a sudden required a certain amount of money that she wasn't then also Saving for college and then got to a point where she couldn't stop because she would lose her apartment her dog or her Not her dog, but like her apartment or her car. Well, eventually

 SPEAKER_04 [0:55:56.159 --> 0:55:57.441]: 
  ending

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:57.441 --> 0:55:58.099]: 
  Yeah, and then

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:00.141 --> 0:56:01.525]: 
  Yeah, I don't know, just in general.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:56:42.801 --> 0:56:46.007]: 
  Well, eventually when she gets to college and gets a job, she can stop.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:45.754 --> 0:56:51.120]: 
  But she didn't she was saving up for college, but then she ended up using it to create that life. I see yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:49.703 --> 0:56:53.297]: 
  life's a lot nicer. Well, good for her for working so hard. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:52.656 --> 0:57:01.650]: 
  Yeah, they make a lot of fucking money. Yeah, I know. They make a lot of money. Even the, I mean, this deja vu wasn't even that fancy, and it wasn't in like downtown Las Vegas.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:55.002 --> 0:56:55.727]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:19.015 --> 0:58:12.441]: 
  I don't know. I don't know. Maybe. You'd be a tease. When I was in Mexico City, we ended up going to a strip joint. It was a ladies club. So it was all these men who were dancing. Why did you go there to meet the ladies? It's a long story how it ended up happening. But anyways, I ended up going to this place with a group of people and it was actually really entertaining. Like there was a guy, like I remember a screen came down. This is in Mexico City by the way. A screen comes down and they played a scene from Backdraft and then all of a sudden the screen started going up and you could see it was in the darkness but there was like the fire light, the spinning red light and you could hear like the siren and then as the lights came up you saw the light was on top of a ladder and a guy came out in like a fireman's outfit and then like he started stripping to that. And it was actually really, it was kind of funny but it was also kind of classy and it was, you know what I mean? Like it wasn't just like some girl rubbing her fucking titties in your face.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:57:30.878 --> 0:57:31.941]: 
  What did you go there?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:32.819 --> 0:57:33.595]: 
  Meet the ladies.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:05.404 --> 0:58:06.130]: 
  And it was actually...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:06.130 --> 0:58:06.231]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [0:58:12.441 --> 0:58:23.444]: 
  Be honest. Did you turn me on? No, no, no, listen. You saw these guys stripping a little bit, right? You saw these guys taking down. Did your penis at least move at all? They'd move a little bit. You're like, oh no, I need to get out of here.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:23.207 --> 0:58:24.270]: 
  Did it withs.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:58:24.270 --> 0:58:27.460]:

  Thank you for being honest. So we'll get you to take a look.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:32.556 --> 0:59:01.429]: 
  So we're gonna give Nick a round of applause for you. No, no, no. But the best part, I think the coolest thing was, is that they brought up these girls that were up there, and they wouldn't, they'd bring up all sorts of girls. Like, it wasn't like they were singling out like some pretty girls or something. Like, they'd bring up all sorts of girls, and these guys gave them such a show. And you can just tell, like, they were all so happy, and there was no, like, there was no even hinting at taking off like his, his banana sack. You know what I mean? Like, that's... So it was, yeah, but it was still really classy in that way.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:58.493 --> 0:59:04.804]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:04.804 --> 0:59:09.023]: 
  No, but he got his butt in her face and she got to squeeze his butt a little bit.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:08.348 --> 0:59:13.900]:
