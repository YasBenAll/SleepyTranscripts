 SPEAKER_01 [0:00:04.446 --> 0:00:37.268]: 
  Guys, I want you to get food, but it's so cold. Your little nose is red. Your little nose is red. Like Rudolph. He he he. Guys. Wait, so you didn't get any food? No, I couldn't. Guys, we're snowed in. It looks like we're going to have to do a podcast while we're snowed in. Oh, no! We're supposed to do a podcast when we have no food. And to think we were going to go out. I was going to go out to get some food, and now we're snowed in. We're just going to jerk each other off, but I guess that's OK. I was going to do a podcast. We can jerk each other off. We were going to jerk each other off and record it, but we might as well do a podcast now. All right. That was the worst ever.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:06.454 --> 0:00:06.741]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:07.804 --> 0:00:09.239]: 
  Your little nose is red, like Rudolph.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:10.319 --> 0:00:10.605]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:20.494 --> 0:00:23.211]: 
  I'm supposed to do a podcast when we have no food.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:25.793 --> 0:00:26.620]: 
  Now we're still in.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:28.611 --> 0:00:30.130]: 
  I was just gonna- We can't jerk each other off!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:38.230 --> 0:01:01.450]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense. A world enveloped by a seemingly unending ocean of forests. Buried deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little cabin. And in that cabin... Is a bunch of guys, is a bunch of bullshitter...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:01.450 --> 0:06:19.527]: 
  Hey, welcome to Sleepycast! Well, special Christmas special! We are the... Christmas tears, kinda like the planet tears. I'm StamperTV and my ring has the power of Christmas lights. Of Zach. And your ring has the power of candy canes. Candy canes. And... I'm Nile and my ring has the power of heart! Faggots! Of coal in your stocking. I have the power of the Northern Star, the best one of all. Thank you. No you don't. It's a lie, it's a bull piece of lie. It's really really really good to be power. You could have done like stockings or Santa or Jesus. The power of angry parents who have found out their kids, found their Christmas presents before Christmas. You're the power of the dad wearing a Santa outfit and the mom going... Hmm, keep that on. You have the power of statistical Christmas suicide. Is it? Did you see that? What? Christmas suicide, the suicide spike around Christmas telling people to get really sad. Yeah well I'm... You already depressed. My parents, my mom is like terrified that I'm gonna kill myself on Christmas because I'm not coming home for Christmas. She keeps going like, you'll be okay, you'll be okay. Work, work considering you're gonna kill yourself. I don't care about Christmas that much. We're gonna watch movies and have a big-ass Christmas dinner. Me and Zach and Nile are going home for Christmas. Yeah. We're gonna have some fun. I'll be away a little bit but make a day and come back. You can come back to whatever time. Don't celebrate too much, fellas. We're gonna get crazy with a candy corn. People say that. That's Halloween. Have little peeps. Have Easter peeps. What's your favorite holiday meal, Zach? I got this one. Zach likes turkey, little side of green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, gravy, you know, the classic stuff. My family has ham. That's right. I love ham and I hate ham. I like ham but not... Ham is good on a sandwich. Oh you know what we said is thick slices of ham. Our powers combined we summon Captain Christmas. Captain Christmas? Welcome Captain Christmas. Welcome to the Christmas special. I am Captain Christmas. What? Anyways, talk about ham. Ham. Ham is a meal of stinks. It looks like pussy. Oh, you mean like when they get a big-ass ham? It looks weird. I hate going... I hate the dinners where they have the big ham and they cut you off like a ham steak or whatever. But you don't want to glaze it with some delicious stuff. But it's weird because I want to... Glazed ham is tasty. I went over to Swain's house for Thanksgiving and he had like nine turkeys and I actually brought a ham. Because I thought other people would eat it. Oh, thinking outside the bar. I liked your ham, Stamper. People liked it though. I had a little blackberry glaze on it. You did. Everyone told I had a bite at night. The glazed ham was the shit. It always feels like it's never really... I like either thinly sliced or like sort of cooked a little bit. It always seems like it's kind of... If it's a little bit raw. These big wet slices. Yeah, the big little like siya sloppy. It's like turkey. It's like you can make turkey really badly. You can make dry or you can make turkey that's really juicy and tasty. Rubbery. There's a good way to make turkey. There's a good way to make ham. People love their ham though. Have you ever seen a honey baked ham? There's a franchise called Honey Baked Ham. Around the holiday seasons it got a line out the door. I went there to buy a ham with my dad once. And I was waiting in line for like three fucking hours. Just to get a fucking ham. I was like, dad, this better be the best fucking ham in the world. Sitting here like a fucking Aerosmith concert for fucking ham. And then they don't do any business for the rest of the year. They're just around the holidays. That's all they do is is like a fireworks stand for ham. They probably get one dude in there to buy a ham like a week. And then come Christmas time. It's just ham, ham, ham, ham, ham, ham. In Ireland, our Christmas dinners are you guys' Thanksgiving dinners. Well, our Thanksgiving dinners usually spill over a little bit. Like it's pretty much the same shit. We do Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas dinner. Yeah, we access the proper shit. I've never had a Christmas dinner. What do you do it on Christmas Eve? Yeah, Christmas Eve when you wake up and worship Jesus and look at his bloody hands and face and screams. I don't care what people say. Christmas is not about Jesus. No one cares about Jesus on Christmas. That's because he doesn't give you presents like Santa. Exactly. I'm wrong. I care. No, you don't. What do you care about? What did Jesus do on Christmas? He, I don't know. He died, I guess. He put the... No, he woke up. He woke up. Oh, he woke up. He woke up. He slid out of her big slivvy pussy. He slid off his coffin later. See, how could Jesus be born to a virgin if her hymen was still there? Wouldn't that get in the way? It's magic, man. It's like a logical battle. Jeff used his power ring to shoot the North Star up in the sky. Then the three wise men came by with gold Frankenstein's and Merce. The beautiful dead white man crawled out of his cave and happily ever after. Baby's coming out of the assholes, you idiot. Why were the pussy matter? What happened after Jesus got resurrected? He just, he moved the rock and he just walked away. He flew into heaven. He said... Like an angel. He flapped his arms like wings. So he could go through the wall like Patrick's Wazing Ghost. He had to move a rock first and then he flew up. Oh, dude, he's like the mummy of the return. Oh, his whole body got up and left, right? That's where that the magic cloak comes from. What really happened is people go, dude, that's fucking Jesus in there. Let's like steal his body. All you have to do is move this rock. And then people go like, Oh, he's gone. They found Jesus' bones and it was covered all over them. So we have a good idea of what happened. Guys took him and fought him. They tried to clone Jesus from his bones, but they just got some like black dude. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:20.485 --> 0:01:21.497]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:13.064 --> 0:06:14.009]: 
  They tried to, um...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:20.809 --> 0:09:26.620]: 
  It's offensive. It's not offensive. Jesus was a little Easter dude. You're defending everybody right now. No, he wasn't. Have you ever seen that picture? He grew up in fucking Iraq, dude. He was a beautiful white man. He had curly golden locks, Zach. Beautiful eyelashes. Haven't you ever seen a painting? Yeah. Jesus. And he's a big love heart right in the center of his chest. Have you seen the actual, like, revision of what he's just put on the plate? He did like an average compilation of what everyone looked like from that era in the clip. Can he look like a borderline caveman? Yeah, he had like a uni brow and he was like, you know. Dude, he would be fucking stopped and checked on an airplane today. Do you think the portrayal of Jesus, though, did anything, this is kind of dark, of course. Do you think like every other guy in that time period would sort of like just want to rape him? They would be like, hey, pretty boy. Hey, white boy. He's like two. He's like two. He had like beautiful brown chestnut locks with long flowing hair. He had like curly little ends of them. Well, God forbid you paint an ugly Jesus. Of course, he's got to be beautiful. How did Jesus uglyly worship him? If he was like, hey, fuck, dude, go worship someone else. Go over there. Yes. Go walk in that one. Don't fucking get away from us. Everyone would think he was kind of cool, but you wouldn't hang out with him in a spare time. Yeah, what do you think of Jesus? He has a really good personality. You know what? Yeah, I think it was funny, is like a lot of these white, southern Christians today, these Republican kind of really deep southern guys. If they went to heaven and saw Middle East of Jesus, they'd be like, get the fuck out of the way. Where's Jesus? Is he behind you? Me and you met when a wall last night, remember that? A Jesus? Yeah, we stopped by at the. You were in the back of the U-Haul truck, so you didn't go in with me and Zach, but me and Zach went in there to get the. Yeah, yeah. And we're by the thing. I don't know why I said it, but I was like, Zach I think found, he found like a little can of soda that he wanted. So I'm going to get this little can of soda. And I was like, Merry Christmas, Zach. And this is a southern, old southern guy. Big trucker guy. Trucker guy, and this camo gear walked by. And he was like, that's right, brother, leave Christ in Christmas. Fuck all this happy holiday shit. Just say, Merry Christmas. And I was like, yeah, right, happy holidays, happy. And he was like, no, Yeah, he got married. Merry Christmas. And I was like, okay. But I don't get that, dude. Christmas is one day out of the whole month. Yeah. There's other holidays going on. You should take it on Christmas, like Christmas Eve, Christmas day. Not even on Christmas Eve. You sound like a fucking idiot when you say Merry Christmas and it's the 17th. It's not Christmas yet. Why can't you say happy holidays? There's tons of holidays back to back. I think the Christmas season has everything up, leading up to Christmas, even into New Year's. Yeah. There's like happy holidays. Channukah New Year. Channukah. Quanta. Quanta. What is Christmas? What is Quanta? What you call a Christmuss? If you're so into Jesus, that would go back to Wawa and tell the, hey, trumpet guy, why don't you go blow your precious fucking Jesus? Yeah. You ever talk to me like that again? I'll bust this soda across your whole ass head. Yeah. You're saying that in retrospect. You didn't say that at the time. Yeah. You said we did reach the guy's chest and pause. Hold out, hold the show until there's a video. Like Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom, you're screaming and didn't die. Yeah. Do you want to keep the Christ a Christmas? I don't really give a shit. I don't really like Christmas. And now we probably have this. Thank you. Podcast over. No, it's not over because we didn't get to that. You can't just say it's over. It's okay. And what? Christmas.

  Christmas is a burden. I agree. You're the Grinch who fucked Christmas. We're having Christmas with the cranks, aren't we Zach? What's the thing you dislike most about Christmas? Go. The fucking music man. I'm so sick and tired of the same fucking songs. I wouldn't mind if they weren't usually the same songs recorded like 1950s. Yeah, but people say that, but then when someone like a famous pop star tries to release a new Christmas song, you're like, fuck you, that's never going to catch on. Dude, I hate that even more. When somebody takes a shitty old Christmas song and they try to put a modern spin on it. It's like, I'm rocking around the Christmas tree. Yeah, you just like shot the fuck up. It's a song I hated already and then made it worse. Fucking Beyonce. I can't stand it man. I like Wichita Wonderland. There's a couple of Christmas songs I like. There's a few I like because they're not overplayed. Did you buy the Seth MacFarlane Christmas album? I always helped it. I was very tempted. I saw that big smile and I was like, ooh. Come home, you play one track and be like, why the fuck did I buy this? It's like a joke if that's way too expensive. It's just going to guide them to somewhere until you throw it away. Maybe I'll buy that. Give it to my parents. He's not a bad singer. I'll be laughing in the middle of it. He has a really good voice. Yeah. But I don't want to listen to it. He loves the sound of it though. You know he loves his own voice. No, there are definitely people out there that love the sound of their own voice. Oh yeah, he's sitting at home jerking off and he's like, I'm coming and that just makes him hornier. Yeah. You made family guy hear the Cleveland show. Bam! Ooh, did you hear that guys? That was my tummy rumbling. I'm hungry. I really wish you could go out there and get us food. I'm not going to work like these circus dancers. I refuse to work like this.

And I said, Dad, you have a really big pee pee and the bathroom was full of guys. It was like at a train station and they all kind of stopped and wondered what my dad was doing to me. And then he grabbed my hand before we were done peeing and he dragged me out of the bathroom. Did you think we'd grab on your dad's like lower leg and he walked with you? Uh huh. But my dad got a bono and told me I did that. And the guy that was looking, he walked around with me too. It was a great man. Of course he did. And he was like swing to left. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:05.624 --> 0:18:17.642]: 
  I don't know there was another there was another Robby robot game, but I can never remember the name Yeah, they did it was used is like two games. He was really cool though He was pretty cool That was a lot of work for one shitty one or two shitty games I remember when I was a kid I was very scared of like because I was a kid I thought my parents wouldn't get what I want like if you ask for like a gay boy They'll get you like some weird off brand things. It'll know Oh, that was horrible. I asked for an iPod when I was like 15 or 16 and I was oh man I really wanted one because all my friends had one and I just I love man I was dying for that iPod and then my mom started kind of being like throughout the week before Christmas She was like I've heard about these new things called creative Zens. They're better than I got a Z Then I was like no I want an iPod and she was like but these creative Zens are supposed to be great Yeah, no, she's like creative Zen I was like no and then so Christmas came around and I was like open in my presence name my stocking I got like an iPod like cover. I was like, oh god. Yes. Yes, and then I went downstairs I hope my president was a creative Zen Didn't fit and then I tried my best not to look disappointed and sad That's the big thing is like you actually get a bad gift you're like you kid But dude it turned out the creative Zens were much fucking better than iPods Really, but any video you want on them you could like they'd way bigger storage. Yeah iPods are crap They were sweet. Yeah, fuck Apple fuck it Fucking suck. No, I use I use iTunes. I like I don't care for iPods though. Yeah, if you're just playing MP3 There's a ways to go about it like sinking an iPod sink it and delete all your files when you plug into it It's just so clunky and weird. Yeah, my favorite gift along the same lines as Jeff was I got the Nintendo as well But I got the super Mario duck on yeah, Super Mario Combination combo and I got Ninja Turtles and Ninja Turtles was a crock of shit I used to I love turtles and they gave me that and I didn't know at the time How much of a broken shitty game it was and then I remember a similar story much later? I got a Super Nintendo for Christmas and I remember I was sitting in in class And this is already when the PlayStation 1 was out and I was so psyched to get a Super Nintendo because I really wanted one My family was poor So they probably saved up for like two three years just to get me one and then the teacher was like So what did everyone get for Christmas and then when it came around to me? I was like I got a Super Nintendo and everybody in the class laughed at me Because I got a present like they're like yeah, welcome to fucking three years ago Come on man. Oh, I think the best gift ever Everyone else was playing with their I've actually got a PlayStation not long after it came out But it's like what kind of a shitty ass teacher asked a dumbass question like that when they know that signal at the poor kids Yeah, I mean you got your rich snobs in class and you got your poor kids in class like I have to poor kids You're probably just gonna sit there lying be like I got I got a new car. Yeah, and they have my holes in their shoes Like they probably just got like socks and they're super psyched Yeah, I as the builder I get the board I actually do appreciate like clothes like my dad got me a coat less Christmas and it was like one of the best gets ever gone We were talking about that last night if I've got a jacket or a nice coat that fit well That'd be like the best gift ever. Yeah, yeah, exactly. We're like video games. I could fucking buy them Whatever no, do you have a best or is it just disappointing? I don't know if I had a best gift But that doesn't mean I didn't get good gifts because I appreciate all my gifts But uh like oh don't don't don't throw us all to the bus though Every gift is special. Yeah, like cuz cuz you know my parents, you know, they didn't have much so anything was a bonus You know, all right, Charlie Brown All right Linus give you big speech on the fucking stage you talk about Jesus Like as I got older like as I got older I started asking for like I was like no Like surprised me because I was like trying to be nice I was like you don't have to spend a lot of money on me and then Christmas came around all my sisters We're getting new phones and stuff and I was getting like underwear and like Fucking damn it. You remember any horrible horrible gifts like what's the truth like man? I can't even appreciate this because this is so yeah, I got Simpson's Road rage on the ps2 like it's a great game Two years ago Should bring up our worst gifts or what's it really bad just like I'll tell you what I had a I had a die cast Voltron figurine when I was a child I have no idea what the fuck that is.

I mean it was weird It had these little extra action figures that could go in the lion's the lions were much bigger much bulkier They were I don't know and almost just it was just the I'm just so much lame or Voltron in it It ruined my Christmas the I Wasn't you know, I wasn't even that young I don't think I was I think I wasn't even ten yet But I was like I was so bummed out I was so my parents like tried that maybe the other one wasn't even available anymore I mean, I was so unappreciative Yeah, that's I would be afraid to have kids because I imagine gave a really sweet gift. They're like, oh, this is what it was It's like god damn it you little fucker. You're gonna regret this for the rest of your life Once what once when I was like kind of skeptical about Santa I was like to my mom I go Hmm, I'm gonna write a Christmas list, but I'm not gonna show you and I'm gonna see if I get the right gifts Just to see if Santa's real and she goes yeah Go ahead and then I got too scared that I wouldn't get the gifts I want so I just showed her anyway, but she called your bullshit Called your bluff. God damn it when I was like eight nine I wrote a list, but it was like I was like if Santa can do anything for free I'm gonna ask for a bunch of gifts for my entire class and give all the gifts my class And I asked like 40 things I got like two things I was like fuck Santa it makes total sense because my parents saw Christmas was like the two pages They're like, oh, look at you any of this. Did you give those two things to the people and no It's my shit. Do I like anything anybody else so much for your charity? Did you uh, did you know the original yellow ranger is dead now? Really?

  original power ind sane

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:03.625 --> 0:28:53.307]: 
  to a button was the green ranger that dickhead you know he just comes in every now and then Kudliese the rice was the yellow one yeah green ranger was the coolest man and then he there's Tommy and then he's in really good shape now he's got sick ass tattoos I don't know why I know this much dude it's funny why he's like he's like 50 and he's still dressed it up as that in that shitty he's got his little pony too spandex uniform he's he's got um he's he's really well in the martial arts world you know I just watched I watched this video series explaining the original the original power Rangers that aired in Japan and it's amazing how different it was yeah yeah they just spliced footage from the Japanese and then added American actors like Saved by the Bell right yeah yeah no wait what did they do with Saved by the Bell? no like Saved by the Bell like they just took a lot of shots from high school talking to Megazord and shit like that and then all the fighting was like from the Japanese show yeah they edited the whole thing I think Rita sounds like this all the time it's all like clearly like well whatever it doesn't matter we're talking about Christmas we're talking about do you remember the movie with Ivan Hoos? yeah that good soundtrack it was a fairly good movie they had cool costumes in that movie too their suits were sweet oh what were we talking about oh Santa hey yeah when was when did you I guess discover that Santa didn't exist well well you just knew it I think I was I was late to the game because I've been over imagined like I was late to the game I was like 11 I was way too old all my friends were like 9 and I'll tell you what did it for me you know I was still doing the whole loop cookies out and all that kind of thing and my parents were pretty good at it to give them credit they would do that they would shake the jingle bells and they'd rub it up like oh fuck it's Santa Claus but one night you know the cookies the next morning woke up on Christmas day and there was fucking Milo from Beaver's standing in the rug and I was like what the fuck happened my dad was like yeah Santa Claus he came here and helped himself to the Milo from the fridge leftovers and I was like what? and I put it together and my dad got really wasted and fucking ate Milo from Gadget and just spilled it on the floor with the bed and I was like you're Santa Claus you fucking liar yeah but my parents like never tried to hide the fact that they're putting presents like every night at Christmas that's the night the kids can't sleep and they just they were so fucking loud with the presents and shit but for some reason I still believed it until I was 12 my parents did that thing where they packed the presents beforehand and then sneak them downstairs like so they'd be like don't come in here I'll give you Christmas gifts or let's say anything or just kind of do it like a back room my parents always put their names on the presents that were good and the Santa's name on the presents that were shitty it's fucking smart to me so maybe that kind of contributed to me never giving a shit about Santa because as far as I remember I don't think I ever believed in Santa I knew that who Santa was but like I never had this belief that there's a dude that came into your house that's a good point to actually presents under the tree I think at first the same thing was like my dad would give me like a huge like a rocket like an RC car but Santa would give me like a fucking Pez the Spitzer I was like fuck Santa man okay we um let's talk about like how awkward it is now as an adult where your parents are basically like they're very guilt-ridden about Christmas they're like well we have to buy you something we have to get you something for Christmas but as an adult you sort of have the money to buy yeah what you want what you want and it's gonna be better when you want here's your body I don't really feel like waiting like I don't feel like saying well I want this and I have to artificially wait three months for them to give it to me yeah oh thank you and I'm just gonna buy it tomorrow yeah just give me cash if you give people cash is the best thing or like a movie theater gift card or like a gift card to like Red Lobster or Outback Steakhouse or something I'll tell you what those are good I fucking hate gift cards gift cards are good to restaurants it depends no like if you get a oh we're talking about gift cards they're all terrible if you if you get a gift I say if you don't know what to get somebody Seth Wawa gift card I would say like Wawa gift card or like in Corey's case like he really likes Outbacks you can get him a $50 Outback problem solved but I was thinking like a good gift card is like $100, $200 for Home Depot or something like that Home Depot or like Target even Target so you guys are saying you hate gift cards but you like gift like all these like as long as it's these I don't say that it's force it's just a weird thing where it's like oh it means more if you're forcing them to spend it in a particular place oh you mean just versus giving them money yeah I would rather give money but if I do give gifts like there's certain places where it's totally it's like you could give somebody bad gift card like you could give him a $50 gift card at Barnes & Noble now you're like oh now I have to spend $50 at Barnes & Noble don't give me a $25 Starbucks gift card what I don't like is that the gift card is never even you can't even buy $50 for the stuff it's like oh you have $3 worth of other gift cards like by the end of the year you have like $100 left over money on the fucking gift card it's all accumulated you know what all you naysayers gift cards the janitors and us gift cards the Wendy's fuck you just got it damn it I was just about to say I was like to to that fan there's a fellow called the janitor who gave us a bunch of stuff in the peel box yeah he gave us like he gave us a shit ton of stuff in the peel box he like stocked we're still like getting through the food he gave us and there's like 5 or 6 of them we went there I had myself a Baconator he gave us a what I had a Baconator I had a large price yes what did I pay for it give us a Wendy's gift card it's like oh it's gonna Wendy's oh he gave us two Wendy's gift cards they're $15 each thanks for sharing Faggots it was all safe room you're welcome well he said you're not a pledge at all he said don't do it safe room he was a monster I couldn't control him he did say that in the note he said fuck Jeff all caps and red blood I think it was but yeah you the thing I don't like about the gift is hey you just said fuck gift cards you go to Wendy's and buy your own fucking food you guys are hoarding all these gifts check out mate man the thing I like about the gifts is like I say don't give me anything if you do give me something get cash and they say oh wait you really want that I say I don't want anything because if you give me something I have to give you something and I don't want to give you anything and I don't want you to return give me cash if you give me anything and they say oh you don't have to give me anything my parents every parent of the fuck I think this is like a memo when you become a parent you have to say it's every year on Christmas you have to say all I want for Christmas is you give me my gift it's like don't do that or that fucking joke that everyone uses for Christmas you're getting a hug everyone uses that everyone uses that I never heard that one before oh shit oh shit I honestly never heard that one never did but everyone's heard all I want for Christmas is you you're my gift to whatever it's on yeah yeah this whole thing and especially when you have family members who when you sort of do you have family members you sort of trade gifts with and some you don't like do you have like yeah basically yeah it's like there's these awkward moments where you know there's this I guess his unwritten rule where my cousin decided one year he's like well let's just not you know let's just not exchange gifts between us but nobody fucking told me that so I show up I show up at the house with like a book or two or four ham or something and I give it to him and then he has to he doesn't have a gift for me so he pulls this I didn't realize it at the time he pulls this weird sneaky move where he was giving he was giving like my mom like two plants and he went over and he like picked up one of the plants and he gave it to me he's like here Merry Christmas what I like about that is like it's like the year after that I'm sure he's gonna feel guilty and say what happened this year what happened last year so look at your gift but then you'd be like well I didn't give you a gift last year so fuck him I don't give him a gift if he gives you a gift that year I feel very stressful I feel bad I think I was a little prick because we used to do we used to do like this secret Santa thing amongst my like cousins and shit and like literally all day when we'd have like a party and do the gift thing I'd just be all the kids would be looking so much forward to like the gift to open in the gifts and I was like oh god I was like in a sweat I was like when are we opening them was it random? no no no like we'd pick a name out of a hat and so it was random who you got the gift for? oh yeah yeah yeah no sorry yeah and then like I got this jacket and I was so fucking like upset I was so upset I was a kid like I just wanted a computer game or something you got a jacket you said? yeah and I feel really bad because I feel really bad she probably knew that I was upset yeah now I think a jacket's great now I love jackets she probably yeah

  Very stressful.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:25.919 --> 0:28:26.779]: 
  Was it random?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:27.370 --> 0:28:27.775]: 
  No, no.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:29.834 --> 0:28:31.454]: 
  So it was random.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:41.579 --> 0:28:44.346]: 
  Yeah, and if you're really bad

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:54.353 --> 0:34:24.512]: 
  Now you made me feel worse ever I know if you open up you like I don't want this shit Yo bitchy through the floor and stepped on it didn't have tags on it Or did she just pull out of a closet and give it to you know that tags on it. It was a nice jacket It was like old Navy or something. What do you think about people leaving tags on gifts or like price tags? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, is that is that kind of like a fuck you. It's like yeah, I think this yeah I always take prices off. I do I ever buy anyone ever regardless It's not a fuck you it's a kind of bragging thing it's like but it go either way could be like oh five dollar thing I thought it was like $10. Thanks. Yeah, but they could easily just put like a fake tag on something be like Could happen hey Jeff you're going to see your parents this Christmas correct you find you if you find that you act Significantly different around your relatives. Yes, not my parents though There's whenever we have I'm just saying like in general like a maybe you guys can Enlighten me on this if you have a similar experience But basically do you have relatives that you only see maybe once a year possibly holidays and yep everybody You're like everybody on my side of the family like my myself my parents and then everybody else when they interact together You can sort of tell they're not being themselves. They're this was creepy They're putting on these weird like masks all smiles and nods. Yeah, and it's like I can tell my parents aren't acting How they normally act and I can tell they're not acting how they normally act everyone just being overly pleasant Yeah, look at it in the way that like they're probably talking to each other as they were when they were younger And they talk to their kids different like they'll talk to you differently because they need to be like Disciplinarians and shit perhaps it's reversed maybe for the most part of the year They're not being themselves because they're miserable and then when they all get together it's too. It's all too nice. It's too sugary It's it's too bullshitting. Yeah, it's just too fake. There's also this it seems to be that there's also a There's like this weird almost forced like let's not fight it's Christmas And it's just like that you the thing is it's weird because you've known them for like 30 for over 30 fucking years And you still don't know them as people you've seen been meeting talking them for 30 years And you still don't know who they really are. Yeah, the see that's that's the key word is people You know families family or whatever who gives a fuck but at the end of the day It's a room full of people that that happen to be related by blood Look at this way take any one of those people and think like would this guy be my friend in real life More often than not it's no like you would not be that person you wouldn't talk to him He's like your neighbor like you're not friendly every now and again. That's it. Weave. That's it Yeah, one side of my family are all into like sports and shit. I couldn't give two shits about that So they all thought it's weird if you all got together in a room like your whole family your extended family Whatever and you're the one to just raise your hand like can we just drop the bullshit? I don't like you you and you why don't we just split off into sex and fucking talk to the people we want to talk to I got treated like kind of like a freak to one half of my car. Yeah, because I was like I was like kind of a nerd and I wasn't Into like they were they were all like really there was soccer players and all like athletic and stuff And I just like was fucking I was trying to like do all this computer shit when I was like 10 and like they were like What the fuck that's oh, that's another fun thing. It's like when you Explore what you do family events and yeah Not only that but when they they bring up something like sports and I don't really watch sports and this guy comes over Kind of like a friend of the family's like so what do you think of the Eagles this season and all you want to do is like I don't fucking care I don't care and I and instead of just saying instead of just saying I don't watch football I I try to make it less awkward by pretending. I try to like fake my way through it. I'm like, yeah, they're Yeah, he's like then he mentions a specific player name is a yeah, what do you think? I know it's touchdowns or whatever. I'm like, yeah, I know it's uh Yeah, it's crazy Display last night I get really quiet and then he gets really quiet you're gonna put your foot in your mouth one day and be like Hey, he's great for a white guy. He's like wait black. Ah, I got you Jeff Walk away the end. Yeah, what if he's been like what if you speak it up? He was all these years just just to see if you might I don't know what the thing there is because I do the exact same thing Like I'm in a bar and it's like hey, do you see the Giants are playing the dolphins? I'm just like, yeah, how about that? Didn't see that one coming. It's like it said it's just saying I don't watch football I don't give a fuck because I don't know with the guy just get up and walk away I mean my neighbor pulled that show on me just yesterday. Hey, you watching the Eagles game What are you excited for them Eagles and I was actually honest. I'm like hey look man I don't you know, I've been saying hi to you for like five years now, but I know I don't watch football So now you know and their responses always the same when you're honest. They're like, oh, okay That's my end of the conversation. I'm like, yeah, I'm sorry. I'm like I guess that makes me lame or a terrible person He's like no you're just you're just not Philadelphian and then he just turns his back and walks away Yeah, but if you don't watch the Eagles and eat cheese steaks every day, then you don't fucking belong in this fucking city If you want to watch football, that's cool. It's like football like knowing about football It's only good for small talk for people that you wouldn't probably want to talk to anyway I don't watch millionaires run around and play a fucking game and players channel gives a shit Carelessly through a bunch of millionaires the place the thing is people people say oh we want to say what the fuck did you? I used to think like yeah, like when people used to play like Madden like football games I'm like that's so fucking stupid. Why don't you just get up and go outside and play football? I like playing football. I mean see football is fun if you like doing it like a recreation play it But now I think the kind of the reverse like playing Madden is more valuable than watching football Something yeah football

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:10.388 --> 0:34:10.962]: 
  football

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:13.982 --> 0:34:14.219]: 
  like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:14.809 --> 0:34:15.331]: 
  Play it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:20.496 --> 0:34:23.516]: 
  Because you're actually doing something. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:25.304 --> 0:44:00.760]: 
  Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Do you not like the athletic prowess of all the players and how like... I just don't give a shit. Do you know any other artists or animators are into sports? Literally none. I don't feel like a lot of people are really into sports for like the wrong reasons. It seems really rare. You see like a group of six people, one of them is probably really legitimately into sports and then the other five people just like screaming at a screen and getting together and drinking beer. Like they could probably give a fuck less. Yeah, people watch like the nerd, like the animators and stuff. They all watch like fucking like let's play. Not all of them, but like a lot of them watch like let's play. It's kind of a form of the same shit. Why don't we cover it? Like why don't we just briefly cover what do you think it is that a white, white-owned artist like watching sports? Because there are fucking scheme elephants whose parents are disappointed in them. Because they're busy working? No dude, because they're fucking... Okay, like they're probably nerds. They probably like video games and they watch like let's plays and like... Well, let's break it down a little further than that. Just like not that they're... Like me included, I'm a fucking nerd. Like what is it like when football comes on the television screen, is it just visually boring to you? It's just visually boring. It's always the same thing. Like you go to any bar any time of the year and there's always like guys just kind of scrambling on a field and you're like, oh that's fucking... It just looks like a scene. It's just completely like apathy. And it looks like something that you have to follow constantly and consistently. I'm not willing to make that commitment. And then how can you like have... Like you just like, yeah, I really like the Eagles. It's like, okay, so that's the Eagles and that's your home team, that's cold. So what validity does it have when they keep swapping players out? Then what happens to your fucking team? Almost all of them aren't even from Philadelphia. Yeah, you do what you get all the bunch of guys from fucking... What's that movie with fucking Mark Wahlberg where... Yeah. It's like, oh yeah, the Eagles, it's a Philadelphia. It's like a dude from fucking New Orleans and then like three imports from fucking... They're pretty much just companies. It's not like they're fucking representing... I think it was... And then you get furious like, wow, what do you think about fucking so-and-so moving to Miami? It's like, I don't give a shit, I really don't care. Right, they just go back to it. It's like, I like playing sports is fine, but I don't care watching somebody else play it. I used to have a lot of fun playing just football with my friends. Just throwing it around. But everyone who watches these sports feels like they won the game when they did nothing. Yeah. I don't get it. They watched a bunch of grown men play ball. I just love watching people do other stuff that I could do myself. It feels like I wasted time. But to clarify, I have no problem. You know, if you're a fan of football, that's cool. It's just not my thing. I don't get it. Yeah, I just don't get it. I'm sure a ton of our listeners are probably big fans. Probably soccer. Probably like real football more than American football. Yeah. We've been talking about American football. I've been talking about American football this whole time. These guys that obsess over sports stats in general are like the most alien beings of all to me. They just love shooting off stats. Like they just study stats. What about like fantasy football and shit? Yeah, fantasy football is another thing. Well, if there's something in it, like you're making money, I think that will actually like make the dynamic different. What's weird with fantasy football? Those guys look down on people who do... I do see validity in football if you like bet on a team and you win money. Exactly. If there's money involved, that's the only reason I'd watch it. That's just like a dog fight. Man, if I had money like on like football every week, I would learn everything about football. I would be like a pro at it. So maybe that is one of the reasons. Well, you know, on the opposite side of the spectrum, me and Jeff watch like hours of street fighter tournaments. I mean, who the fuck are we to talk? That's even more... that's like a dude playing a game. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. So like how are we to talk about like this? Like we're actually watching these athletes who actually have their bodies are been morphed for this game. Whereas less like not less players, but like tournament people, their bodies, I guess, also have been morphed for what they do. But I think it's interesting in that regard because it's like watching a game of a fast-paced like digital chess. I like to watch people out smart others. I used to play tennis and used to watch tennis. Yeah, that's true. Because tennis, you know, a lot of people could say tennis is like, you know, this pansy gay sport. Gay girl, he's sports and sex. Just because the atmosphere it's in, it's always like Wimbledon, it's always such a snooty atmosphere, but... They're sipping tea and they're all wearing like whites. It's almost, it almost is like a fighting game where you're constantly, it's very fast-paced. There's many ways to out smart or trick your opponent into fucking out. See, I just see it as just like... Tennis is hard to watch because you can't really, you have to put yourself in the shoes of the guy. Like if you're actually playing tennis, this is balls flying everywhere. Like in Zach's mom's room. Right? Right, dude? Everywhere. But it is really fast-paced, but when you're watching it from like a skycam, it doesn't look like much. You just... Once you play it, know the rules and understand... It's like, yeah, it's more interesting once you really feel like you understand it. Like same as watching a fighting game stream or whatever, but trying to... Maybe I never took the time to understand football. Maybe that's just what I'm not into. That's fair, that's a fair point. I'm sure it's, I'm sure it'd be more interesting if I really tried to study it, but... I mean, I get the rules. I get how it works. I understand how they play. Maybe I'm just not into it. It just seems a little, it seems like there could theoretically be a sport in the band that's much more exciting. A much more exciting team sport. Have you ever watched a sport on TV and you just feel like it's kind of barbaric and weird and old that we still do this? Like that we still... Do you think it's like the modern equivalent of like gladiator fights and stuff? Yeah, well like, you look at baseball and it's like we throw this ball and a guy hits it with a stick and then he runs and then somebody might catch it. It's so like prehistoric. I think Royce is those fucking... What are those called? The fist fighting... It's not UFC, that's wrestling. Boxing? No, it's not boxing, it's MMA. Oh. I'm amazed it's interesting to me. That's actually, I follow that. No, no, but I'm saying that's more like, that's dudes literally fucking hitting each other. Oh, like Cape Man. Yeah. They do have talent though. It's pretty much... I just have to download it, I'm just saying it's literally... If the alien's all that, they'd be like, what the fuck is Royce doing? Let it be known, Zach thinks MMA guys are pussies and there's four children in his family. If you're a strong fight stapler, because he can take out all of you, that's what he thinks. I'll take out all of you in a fucking row. That's not true. Someone's gonna punch you in the back of the headache eventually and kill you. So would you say faggot? See, would you... If I lived in Roman times, I think I'd be going to the Colosseum every fucking day because besides I've got, you know, gladiators fighting each other, gladiators fighting animals, there's even shit where they'd flood the Colosseum and they'd have little like naval battles. Do you know they had the equivalent of... Inside the Colosseum? That was awesome. You better knock on my door, be like, they got tigers today, I'll be like, I'll be there every fucking day. I know they found recently that they had the equivalent of like hot dog stands at gladiators shit. I'm not surprised. And like fries and stuff, but like in the ancient version of them. I heard that while these two fucking American establishments are fighting over who invented the first hamburger, they were serving hamburgers during Roman times at the Colosseum. You gotta be such an asshole. We talked about this in Wendy's before. The equivalent of like meat patties inside pita bread. And you got these two guys like, oh, my grandfather invented the hamburger. Earl of Sandwich invented the sandwich. You gotta be such an asshole to claim a fucking like dish every... It's like meat for a sandwich and bread. He was like, this is mine. It's like, dude, you're fucking doing an asshole. Dude's mom made it for some dude in Kansas long before that was probably the first one that you say, dude, I've been eating that for years. Like, why do you guys get to fight over it? You gotta be some asshole. It's meat between bread. As soon as like agriculture was fucking invented and bread was invented, people have been doing that. There's no way people would grab and fucking have raw hamburger patties and go, is there an easy way to do this? Yeah. Someone put bread over patties. It's like those failure infomercials, like a black and white guy picks up bread and he's like, oh, what meat too? And he gets grease on his hands and he's like, oh, no! And he goes all over his shirt and he's like, ugh. Yeah, the Earl of Sandwich, the first sandwich ever invented was in Great Britain in 1780, 30,000 years after bread was first invented. Yeah, the first sandwich. And meat. Fucking frauds. Frauduents. Yeah, frauds. Fucking the Earl of Sandwich, the most boring man. It's like, God, I need something. My term's almost stopped. I invented the sandwich. It's mine. I named it. I don't care who had it. Off with your head. What if Obama invented a food called the Obama? Would you eat that, Zach? Sounds awful. The Obama? It would be. It actually doesn't sound bad. What kind of food would you call Obama? I'll tell you what it would be. And now this is political. The package would promise all these great things, but when you open it, it's burnt and rotten, and that's very good. And it goes up, you know what? And here's something else. It's not very good either. What do you mean it's burnt? It's fucking black like everything. I'd say it almost sounds like some kind of sliced meat or some kind of chunky soup or something. I was going to say it sounded like a chili dog with big lung sausage. Hey, let's go get an Obama. It's a chili dog with chunky chili and cheese on it. That sounds like an Obama. Yeah, one big Obama, please. Yeah, you want to double Obama? Yeah. I'm fucking hungry. Yeah, just two big lung sausages. And you know something else? It wasn't a dick joke. It wasn't a dick joke. What? I've seen Obama's wiener, pathetic ass wiener. It was a pathetic joke. It trusted the president with a tiny wiener. It was that pathetic shit, probably his name. He was like, Harry's step-er, you want to see my wiener? Yeah, he was like, too bad. There's a chance Obama's taking a shit right now. And they put his finger through his zipper, so it looked like his wiener's like, Check it out. You like it? You see? The president was allowed to tell one joke a year, and I think I knocked it out of the park. That's funny. You think the White House cleaning staff, they get to walk into his bathroom after he takes a huge dump, and they're just like, The things I do for love is they're called his people. Wow, man, he... They're like the most powerful man in the world, huh? They got the most powerful dumps. Do you think they almost want to breathe it in for a little bit, just to sort of like... Gain his powers? Yeah, gain his powers.

  Yeah, you know, it doesn't involve

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:12.317 --> 0:46:12.334]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:17.599 --> 0:46:18.814]: 
  Oh, here we go.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:17.616 --> 0:46:18.443]: 
  Oh, here you go.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:20.940 --> 0:46:21.092]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:21.092 --> 0:46:21.902]: 
  I woke up.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:23.117 --> 0:54:28.898]: 
  I woke up. That was great. I opened the windows. I said, it's Christmas. I shot it at the city. It's Christmas. I said it a second time, just make sure everyone heard me so they knew in case they forgot. It's Christmas. And he said, shut up. Merry Christmas. That's what I said to him. But then the real story begins here to stand because guess what happened? Look at my grandpa's house. I stayed over at his house with my cousins. We went to two years. Every story that, every one of your lie stories involved either your grandpa or your cousins. Listen. I wish I had cousins. Listen. OK. We went to his room. We snuck in like the grim truth stole Christmas. The grim truth? We opened. That real. We opened. We opened his top dresser drawer. When he was in there. He was God doing something. Pornography. Merry Christmas. You know the whole little face? That's what I did. Slept your little cheeks. Some of the little cheeks. Did a little old face. Also a big vibrator. I love it. It was used by my grandmoms. Hopefully your grandmoms. But anyways, they found it. They, they found it. They closed it and freaked out. They found it askew. If you could believe that. Then we got yelled at. Then I cried. Wait. When you were seven, you wouldn't even know what a vibrator was alive. I did. It was dick shaped. Like my big fat dick in my pants. Little pink and had little nubs on it. Just like my dick. Anyways, they yelled at me. They were like, why did you go through my stuff? And I was like, who shoves that in their pussy slash ass? I want answers. And I interrogated them. That's just so. But I really could find a pornography vibrator and cried. You said to your grandparents that when you were seven, who shoved this up there? Who shit is this? Answer me. Who shit particles are these? And smut magazines. So that's a Christmas story. Also, another one is. See, Fond Pornel. Another one. Another one is my brother. Welcome to childhood. But I got the same year I got the Nintendo DS. My brother asked for a little motor, a little pocket rock, a little motorbike. And he got that. But then he was like, that DS is mine. I was like, no, it's not. Like those gas powered things? It's a goal. Yeah, it's a little motorbike. It's a little tiny one for kids. Yeah. And my brother was like, that DS is mine. I was like, no, it's not. He was like, no. Santa gave it to me. It's mine. I was like, no, it's not your fucking lighter. You got a big motorbike. That's all I got, you little bag. He argued. He was like, he had like a temper tantrum. We argued about it. So he wanted both of them? Yeah, he thought it was his too. And I was like, it's not yours, dude. It's mine. And you got nothing for Christmas? It was the DS was mine. I mean, that's what he assumed. It was like he gets all that. Yeah, we argued about it. Brother's a dick. Yeah, we argued about that for a long time. Is he handsome? You could say that. Is he more handsome than you? He's more handsome, but his dick is weird looking. Ha ha ha ha. So he's cursed either way. He's cursed. How's it weird looking? Looks like a skeleton key. He's got a bend at the end and a ring in it somehow. It looks like you could have a crepe in an old man finger. When it's soft? When it's hard. It looks like a witch finger pointing. Yeah. It's always a cue to everybody. What are you looking at your brother's boner for? Everyone sees their brother's soft boner, but. He walked in the room with his son while he was there. Listen, listen, guys. This is the Christmas podcast, not the dick podcast. They're all the dick podcast. What's more Christmasy than a big crepe in bed's dick? Like a spring? Like a shadow on the wall, like a ghost is pointing to hell. Let's talk about Christmas trees. I like, I don't know how popular this is. I guess it's not very popular at all. Go to the store and 99.9% of the trees are like green, plastic green. I like the plastic trees enough. That's fine. You could reuse them. But I like the white ones. I think the pure white Christmas trees are really lovely. Now you say pure white is the best. Oh, here we go. Could you talk a little more about that? Yeah, I like the white trees. The pure white. No, just remember, it's like fond in my memory. Like I remember when I was a kid, like I said the Christmas trees are kind of cool. But then I remember I saw a white one that had nothing but blue ornaments and blue lights on it. And I was like, wow, that's the nicest looking tree I've ever seen. It was just really appealing to look at. And not like those bullshit green trees that are sprayed with like aerosol, fake ass snow. Like what's the point? I just like those like white. Yeah, the white plastic trees. I mean, obviously they're not real, but I thought they're kind of classy. They're like a blank canvas to put all kinds of stuff on. I would get dragged out to the Christmas tree farm every fucking year. It'd always be rainy and muddy and cold. And my dad would hand me the saw and then he'd find the tree and I'd have to saw. I'd have to cut it down and we'd bring it back and set it up. The tree would always be lopsided. So it would never stand up on its own even with like the Christmas tree holder. Did you guys get real Christmas trees ever? I was going to say, we got it one year. It was the best he's fucking because he shed. Because it sheds pine trees. Yeah, no, you have to sort of keep it half alive with putting water and stand, sitting it in water in this, in the thing that holds it up. Yeah, the problem is this thing doesn't work for you well. So we had my dad had to rig this thing with like fishing line to hold at the top of the tree to hold it in place. So it didn't fall over. Yeah, it's like bolted into this ring at the bottom. It's not because every tree trunk is different. And so your tree is always going to be lopsided. It's going to be a huge mess. It's a burden to fuck. It's, I guess they're cheaper. If you got a dispose of it. What's that run you like for $70, $70? I'm not even sure how much they are. They got to be up there. But we'd always have to like, and then you just throw it in the trash, right? Well, yeah, I'll tell you that. Yeah, basically, but there's a woods behind my parents house. So every fucking year I'd have to, once the thing was pretty much dead, I'd drag it out of the house. I was the one charged with getting rid of it. So I had to put on my big fucking mud boots. Was it your punishment because you wanted a Christmas tree? You're like, Kevin, I hated it. I hated getting the real, I hate I despise the Christmas tree thing every year. So you carry like your back like Jesus. No. Did you just get like a moderate size like human height tree? Or did you have to go? No, it was bigger. It was bigger. 8 foot, 9, 10 foot tall tree. Because we had it in our house. It had like a higher ceiling. So we could somehow fit a bigger tree. Was your home like the meeting spot for all the family? Not really. Just kind of your own family. What did you do? Did you ever do the family thing? Yeah, we'd pick different. Yeah, all our families would sort of like choose a different house every year to meet up. But I'll tell you the one thing that's interesting, though, just to finish that story is I drag it out in the woods. And every year, every year I drag it to the same spot. So there's a big pile of like tree corpses from all the previous years. Oh, they're all like degrading. Yeah, yeah, it's almost like a chart of degraded trees all the way down to nothing. How many are sitting there now? There's a few. My parents actually stopped getting real trees a few years ago. They finally just had enough. So the fake trees are pretty expensive. But I guess you could just fold them up. Yeah, my family used that fake tree for like seven or eight years, I think. So to mine. In Ireland, Gypsy sell the Christmas trees and they try to like they try to like scam you. Real trees are like fake ones. No, real ones. They're like they just stand on the side of the road and they're like, what about Christmas? Like every and like. It's really annoying. No, no, that's how they talk. Hey, what about Christmas tree? What about here? No, no, no, no, no, no. It was way too. No, they don't. But they'd. Yeah, like so you have to kind of pine trees in Ireland or is there like fake ass like furs and like it's these pine trees you use. Or trees. No, we had furs that you use for Christmas trees. We got pine trees. Do you? Yeah. Yeah. Because. Arland pine trees. We do. Um, fine trees, fine trees, fine trees. But in Ireland, like it's never it never snows or anything. So it's not really it never really feels like Christmasy. Yes, celebrate Christmas. Yeah, I thought you had like Boxing Day or some shit on the 25th and you celebrate Christmas later. Where the fuck did you hear that? No, no, it's Christmas on the Christmas day and then the next day is Boxing Day. Let me tell you how many people give a shit about Ireland. It's just something I heard and whatever, you know. Boxing Day is the next day. What's Boxing Day again? It's just the day after Christmas. It's when you walk out of the street, you're all drunk and you fucking hate you in the mouth and you never die. I believe that. First wins. Is this a celebration of boxing? The sport? Or is it like? Oh, I have no idea. Or is it like boxing? I think it's like boxing stuff up and giving it. I think it's when you give stuff back. So you take it back to the store, I think. Oh, you're packaging stuff. I think. I know what it has to do with packaging. I'm pretty sure. I don't fucking know. What do you guys do with that? OK, Google.

  Bye!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:26.114 --> 0:54:27.835]: 
  I don't fucking know

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:30.130 --> 0:54:35.159]: 
  Mind just search OK Google. OK Google. What is Boxing Day?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:37.454 --> 0:54:44.963]: 
  Boxing Day in parts of the British Commonwealth of Public Holiday celebrated on the first day strictly the first weekday after Christmas Day.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:45.722 --> 1:09:04.187]: 
  Alright, thanks. What does that mean? What does it do? Just look at it in Wikipedia. You should like add something... Uh, okay, so... To that. It's a holiday traditionally celebrated the day following Christmas Day when servants and tradespeople would receive gifts known as Christmas Box from their bosses or employers in the United Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong. So it's basically when you... The day after Christmas you give, like, if you're somebody's boss, you give them like... Oh, I see. Is that what it means? That's what it means. Well, I like my version better where people put chisels in the face. We don't even call it Boxing Day, we call it St. Stephen's Day. We call it a Christmas bonus that you get before Christmas so you could use the bonus on stuff for Christmas. Your countries are broken and backwards and I don't like it. God bless America. God bless America, the best country ever. God bless America. God bless America. God bless America. Red, white, blue. Come on, guys, it's supposed to be Christmas. We're supposed to be all friends here. Fuck you. Ooh. Hey, uh... No. What... If we actually cared about each other, what would... What gifts would we actually... Would we actually theoretically give each other if we were gonna give each other something? I give you a Voltron and a BB gun and I'd say don't shoot your eye out, Jeff. Oh, my God. And then I'd give you a Crunky Bar, but that's between me and you, my friend. Yeah, you're fucking you. Fuck you and the Crunky Bar. I still don't fully get this thing. I'm shrunking each other. You want to sum up the crunks? Yes, for years... For years... For several years now, probably almost a decade, Stamper and I have been playing this devilish sick game with each other where we call it Crunking Each Other, where basically the... Basically there's this fucking video of this Japanese candy bar commercial. I think they're Korean. Korean, okay. Are they Korean? They might be. We'll put it in the description. There's something inferior to the country. The band is called like... Cat-Toon or something. Cat-Toon and the candy bar is called a Crunky Bar. It's like... It's like a... It's almost like a Nestle. It's kind of like a nest... It's like one of those chocolate bars filled with kind of like rice or whatever. Yeah. But it's just a little candy bar commercial. But it's... They're dancing around and they're running up the stairs and this dude's biting into the candy bar and he's like brushing away his beautiful feathered hair, which doesn't look natural on him at all. And we were always trying to trick each other into watching this fucking video. I don't even know where it started. It's like... It's like... It's like Rick Rolly. It's really Rick Rolly. Yeah, essentially, but it's gone on for years and it really... Really advanced to like... I'd send him the video and then he'd send me the video and I'd be like, God damn it. And then... And then like... He would like send me the video and he would put the hyperlink with different text and then I'd click it and then the fucking guys would come up dancing and he'd be like, God damn it. And then like... We would like send it just like, Dude, could you please look at this flash document or you'd look at this flash movie and see this animation looks okay. And then we'd embed the commercial in the right in the middle and be like, God damn it. And then once I imported a bunch of crunchy bars and I put them like all in Jeff's mailbox and around his desk and this has gone back and forth so much. And then Jeff went out and got a card... A card printed where like... Those recordable cards you can record a message. Yeah, I oh it's like on the front it says like, Roses are red, piss is brown when you're drunk. And then I open it up and there's the Crunky logo and it plays a fucking theme song. I threw it on the ground I was like, God damn it. It's all it's been even to this very day I got crunked like two days ago. Really? It's the dumbest fucking shit. I know. It's just it never ends. It never ends. I ran the dude's face through one of those ASCII art filters in Centi as like in like a text document. Oh my god. So yeah, there's that. Dude, I don't even... I was gonna buy a skull and put the feathered wig on the skull head and filled with blood and then crunky bars and melt to your house. Yeah, it's not over. It will never be until you die before I do. Oh wait, what's what started that? Oh yeah, what we have what we theoretically will we get? Oh. Oh wait, okay, so that's what I get for Jeff. Now I would get you, I get you a bunch of black and milds. I don't know some pots and pans. Oh thanks man. Yeah. Zach, I would get you a new brain, a new heart and courage. I need the courage I need it. I would get Zach a sick ass jacket. And I would get myself... Dick implants. Uh, dick implants. So my penis... You probably just buy you a huge like 80 pack of cigarettes and make you die faster with your booze. Thanks man. Dude, you'll die a happy man. And I give you a Wendy's gift card. Thanks man. Oh, Wendy's gift card. Well the Wendy's gift cards go in your stockings. Those aren't real gifts. Dude, I want a fucking Wendy's gift card. I would give Nile a kiss on the mouth. I'd give Nile a mattress. He's sleeping on the fucking floor like a corpse. That would have been a better answer, yeah? My back is fucked up, but hey. Jeff. Yeah. Oh Jeff, oh Jeff. Well, you give me Zach. You know, like gift cards, like I couldn't give you a gift card. I'd probably give you like some street fighter thing, like a poster. See you know Jeff for years now, but I don't know what I'd give him as a gift. Get him a sick ass tackle box and a fishing license. Actually, no, I would. I'd probably give you like a toolbox and a fishing thing. You used Jack's what Stabber said. Well, I would. A toolbox is always good to have. I won't win. It's kind of odd that you still get gifts. The last time any family members gave me a gift was like when I was 18. And then when I was like 19, my mom got me a carton of cigarettes and a hundred dollars. And I was like, this is pretty cool. But you know, you don't have to buy me gifts anymore. And then they just kind of stopped. Jeff, I would give you a city guard for your tablet. Okay. I'd be convinced to buy one of those for you. I know. It's not such a hassle. I'll blame you. I'm so scared of change though. I swear to God, your dick will get hard immediately. It's like fucking Krakatoa. I'm scared of not being able to reach the keyboard as well. No, you can. That's the beauty is your keyboard can go right under your tablet. Zach scares the shit out of me with instantik arm because he just like fucks the tablet out of the way. Like he just like grab it. I move it. It is such a fucking. Oh my God. Grab it though. You just go like what? If you have a Sintiq or a tablet and you draw it, get an arm board like a rotatable. I think it's like Ergachan or Ergachan or something. Get it. You're not gonna get it. It's like a hundred bucks and it's one of the best investments you could buy. It saves so much fucking desk space, dude. Thumbs down. But you brought you a Virginia. I'm gonna have a Sintiq. Bad gift. Jeff keeps his keyboard behind his Sintiq. Yeah. Yeah, but I'm saying he could have it under it if you wanted to. Yeah, but he's been doing that for years. Now he's gonna have to learn a brand new way because your new fangal budget. I'd have to buy two or three arms just to keep just to make all my workstations the same. Well, then I'd do that. I hate going nuts. Fuck you. You don't know me. I would get Jeff a pretty new hat. Thank you. I would get you. I get you. Jeff, I get you a wall. I'll get you a card in a Sintiq arm. There you go. Fuck you. All right, fair enough. I get Jeff a biker jacket that actually fits. Mine fits. Mine fits good. It's just it's cut weird where if I raise my arms over my head. Oh, your arms are too short. Yeah, the arms are. I hate that. Oh, you just like. There goes like this. Strange. If you like walk like the Tin Man, like you look fine. But the second you go up to point at something, it looks like you're wearing a 12-year-old boy shirt. Oh, I know. That's happening to me. Yeah. It is a little weird. I don't know. Yeah, I'm still looking for the perfect jacket. Can you get one, Taylor made? I don't know. But I don't really. I guess you could buy a Sintiq. You could buy a jacket that's slightly too big and then have him cut it down. I got a suit. But see suits are different though. I got it's kind of off topic, but I got a suit and the sleeves. I thought were too short because the little white part of the of the shirt came out. I was like, I look stupid and I got it longer. And that's even worse because like go it touches my wrist. The little white part of the sleeve is supposed to come out of a suit. I know. So the other suit I only have two. The other one I have that one's cut fine. I look good in that way. I think my arms are regular in that. But the other one I have is fucking the arms are too long. This one time I went to the suit store to buy suit and I tried on the pants and then I had to I was wearing like these really flimsy boxers and I had to stand in front of a mirror while a guy was measuring my legs and you can see like the perfect outline of my wiener. And I know he was like staring at it the whole time and I felt so fucking uncomfortable. And then that's when I learned to wear like really tight boxer briefs when you have fucking suits on because I do. So it's really. I only were box briefs now. I started to stop doing it like some word regular boxers. Well they bunch up when you pull your jeans on and shit. Wear boxer briefs like a normal. But you did. Who the fuck wears tidy whiteies man. Yeah. Briefs. I remember when I think I remember when I was in like early like junior high school and my mom I was wearing those white tidy whiteies. Uh huh. And my mom was actually like listen Jeff you have to wear but you should start wearing boxers. Yeah. And I didn't want to I was being really difficult. I'm like no I like I like my tidy whiteies. You know who's tidy whiteies. Dads they they stuck their big dad into the tidy whiteies and walk around. She knew I was going to have to start like changing and like the. Oh yeah. They were going to get your ass beat. Yeah. Yeah. You gotta prevent me from getting my ass kicked. That's a good parent. That's a good parent. Dude. You know. I'm just a thank her. But I thought I saw stuff. I think about this recently like I was like yeah you know when I was a kid you know you have like your little transformers underwear and your little ninja turtles underwear. But then I was looking at them. I was looking at this photo of this kid in his little just nothing but his little transformers underwear. I don't know why I just admitted that because it's not like a family member. But he has like a little Decepticon logo on his wiener right. And then when you turn around like there's a Decepticon logo on the butt and you think like the designers have to put the little logo somewhere. But isn't it weird that they have to put like Ninja Turtle heads like Bart Simpson just like. Open his mouth with the cockies. Yeah like there's like there's only two places to put it on the butt or on the wiener. Yeah. And it's like well you have meetings like okay so we're making these little power rangers. So we put the Red Ranger's head on the butt. No that's the. Have homercy to Julie right on his dick. Yeah put a little donut on his butt. And then Homer Simpson's head on his wiener. Or do you have like the little pattern ones. Those those were better. I remember having little tidy whiteies. I had like a little red strap and the like this. Yeah I had textures online. Like that. I didn't mind where it was called feces. White is falling snow. Do do feces. Um I know we probably talk about like movies and shit too much but are there any just a briefly like are there any good Christmas movies you'd like to recommend to the audience. I think the Christmas Carol the 1983 one. With who? With I don't know what the fuck his name is. It's not only that shit because there's like nine million Christmas Carol movies. This one's like a 1983 and it's got to do the plate fucking pattern. I don't know what the fuck is C. Oswald and Cobblepot. I don't know what the fuck his name is. But that's not only the best Christmas movie in my opinion but actually one of the better movies I've seen and the Ghost of Christmas Future is still fucking horrifying. Like I watched that movie for the first time only like two years ago when the Ghost of Christmas Future came up I was legitimately scared I was like should I turn the fucking light on. Yeah some scary sound effects every time that thing fucking pointed. What's the name of that movie? The Christmas Carol. Oh the famous story. That's the most famous story. It's like you boy go to the store and get me the biggest goose and then bring it to Bob Cratchit and then come back here and eat my aint himself. What was that movie Miracle on? It was at 34th 34th street. With Matilda or that girl. Yeah that was all right. Um but oh yeah the one where he the Santa was in the mall and he was like speaking Danish or something. It was uh they had to prove Santa was Santa and like courtroom or something. Yeah that one was pretty good. Yeah was it Judy Stewart or was it Christmas on? Yeah it was um. The one where it's like every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings. No that's not Miracle on. That's uh no that's not no that's not. It's what Judy Stewart was a little cool. It's a it's a wonderful life. No yeah that's it is it. Is it? That's a wonderful life. Yep that's gotta be it. I'm pretty damn sure. At least that's what it is. Sorry I'm wrong. Yeah that's great. But uh as far as like modern movie or not so modern but like uh. Oh Die Hard that's a great Christmas movie. Fuck yeah. Die Hard the best Christmas movie. But wonderful Christmas movie. There's a few movies that play every Christmas on TV. It's like a Christmas story, Christmas vacation. Now the Christmas still Christmas. The Christmas still Christmas. What else in those fucking. Christmas with a crank. Almost creepy fucking stop motion rule off shit that you love man. It's the Frosty the snowman those. I used to I love no I actually love the 2D Frosty snowman when I was a kid. Oh that's the one you were talking about. Don't stop motion ones. Yeah they scared the shit out of me. Just stop motion ones are fucking scary dude. Yeah. The Obama snowman used to scurry you fuck out of me. You know when he was evil and he looked in the mirror and his face was like. Yeah. Yeah like the teeth. Yeah. And the movement was like House on Haunted Hill. They're just jittery. Yeah Jesus Christ. If you put a black filter over that cut and change the audio around it'd be a fucking nightmare. Bad Santa is also a good movie. Yeah that one was better than I thought it was good. I haven't seen like. As far as comedies go that's like one of the few comedies where I'm just not cringing at it. It's really just it's so mean it's funny. I haven't seen like. He's calling this like fat ugly kid or he's like you fucking retard. Yeah. Really? In a Christmas movie? Oh he's talking to him like an adult. Yeah. It's weird when like they're casting this movie and they're like yeah we just need a fat weird looking kid that looks like a retard when he calls him a retard it has to be believable. So who told me this. Okay I think it might have been Nile. But I've always wondered like you're watching a show like say you're watching Breaking Bad and you need somebody that's got a really fucking horrible looking face it looks like they legitimately take Matt. Yeah. You don't want to be it's all gone. You don't want to be a the dick and be like uh yeah we need a really ugly woman that looks like she's been taken. Yeah. Somebody told me that what they asked for is a character face. Yeah that was me. Yeah they like they put on like the paper or whatever when you're they're looking for auditions they say character face and then all the ugly people know that that's them so they all go down audition. What do they do with like the huge obese people though where you have to like call them fat and obese like in the script. Character body. Character body. I don't know. It just always makes me uncomfortable. It always is fat fat fatty the casting call. Yeah they're being really mean in the script it's like they're just being mean it's like there's a scene where you're being really mean to a fat person. I'm sure they say that dude. You're like over 400 pounds. Yeah it's like in this scene you have to call them a fat piece of shit and really hurt his feelings. Feel free to ad-lib anything it's like dude I'm not gonna ad-lib shit. Sure they say like it must be over 400 pounds it must be willing to get like go over it. Yeah. That's most of the fat people I know it's got a good sense of humor about their their weight they're like yeah I know fat fuck you let's go to Cheesecake Factory get the cheesecake. Okay enough talking about these big fat worth of subhumans as Jeff always says let's talk about something better like Christmas. Christmas. It is the Christmas special after all guys. Guys my stomach is still rumbling. I love talking about subhumans. It's just there's no food. What are you in the mood for Nile? Any food. Dick. I'm dying here. Cock. Pierce. Splotum. Oh. W-Way.

And the kids like, I wanna play with the fire truck. My kids would never want a fire truck. My kids would never want a fire truck. You left the dad, you left, they were young, I came in and saved them. Kids still want fire trucks. There's Tonka trucks in the stores. There's Tonka trucks in the stores. He doesn't start on the stand, Lee! He's starting on the stand, Lee! They're like little cat machines. He doesn't want a fire truck. What, do you want cool things? You don't know what your son's gonna want. He doesn't want a fire truck. Everyone's with those little digger toys and fucking fire trucks. Fire trucks are cool! So are Seacaws. He thinks that they are lame. He wants a Wawa Pez dispenser. Don't talk about Joey like that, faggot. I'm gonna buy one of those, by the way. I'm gonna kiss him right on the mouth. The Wawa Pez dispenser. You see that? Yeah, I'm playing that. He definitely left so hard, it was like, oh. We were in Wawa yesterday and I just saw Zach just laughing to himself. And I just went over and he was just laughing because there was a Pez dispenser with a Wawa like stock truck as the Pez dispenser. Like when you put boxes, I was like, dude, some kids like what Darth Vader or like... Yeah, it's a semi truck with a trailer on it. It says Wawa and I was like, dude. Did you guys ever get the Hess trucks for Christmas? What are those? Hess gas stations, whatever. Yeah, every year, every year, the Hess gas stations, they come, they come, I don't know if they still do, they come out with a Hess toy truck. And it's different every single fucking year. Really? But my grandfather would give me one, the new one every single year, but they'd, it looked like a tractor trailer or a gas tanker or it would have like a little secret compartment in the back, like a race car in it. It would like every single year, it's different. Oh, it's pretty sweet. Yeah, they're kind of cool, but you're like, oh cool, and then it just goes in the basement, you never see it again. You should collect them all and put them all on the shelves. Yeah, there's a lot of people that do collect them, so they're probably happy. They're in good size. They always come in a box. About the size of a Wawa Hogi. Yeah, exactly, yeah. 599 for a limited time. Enjoy, delicious Wawa Hogi with turkey, sprinkled parmesan, almost had it. What else? Lettuce, tomatoes, onions, light mayo. No onions. This is the Zach special. Disgusting, onions are disgusting. What the fuck you, dude? I love onions. Fuck you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:10.373 --> 1:21:07.264]: 
  But two peaches next to each other remind me of balls. I can eat them. Put them in a little bag. I can't eat them. They're delicious. With a big yellow banana for a big Asian cock. I like licking their fair skin. Is a big Asian cock in peaches? No such a big peaches. They had to like see more on it. People were like... They have peaches. Peaches. I'm sorry now. Sorry. I can't help it. We're both... Well, once again, Nile is the punching bag of this podcast. So, you know... Well, there's our boy. You have to be mean and fight back. You have to snap back. You have to insult him back. How do you insult stamper? I usually am good. I'm usually good. Talk about stamper's shoes. Hey! I'm not wearing any shoes. But he does have a hole in his fucking pants. I can't afford some. Talk about stamper's shoes or lack thereof. Stamper, in the middle of the podcast you whipped out your wallet and took out a shit ton of cash. I saw $100 bills and you were going like this and then you just put it back in. I was sorting my money. So you're like... So you're like... I'm OCD about how money is sorted in my wallet. I hate it when like there's a one and there's a five between the one. And it has to be in order. I hate that too. What was the last legitimate thing we talked about? Peaches. Peaches. Sorry Nile. I love you buddy. You know I love you. No, I just... Who's that little Nile? Who's that little Nile? We're going to throw a big ass party and you're invited. Anybody else going to a Christmas party? Do any of you guys have Christmas parties planned that you are going to? Oh, do you think we're not going to... Unrelated to your family? No. We did go to a... I skipped them intentionally. We did go to an event a couple days ago. You can go and invite me. And you were there to stand for a Jeff, you were there. Yes. Did you consider that a Christmas party? Yeah, yeah. Holiday party. There was some dude with a fucking... There were two dudes with his shitty Christmas sweaters. Oh good kids. So, you know... Those guys made it a Christmas party. Why can't you just be a fucking holiday party? Again, you know, why is it a Christmas party? I mean they were making you... They were forcing you to give you kids toys to get in. For Christmas, yeah. For gifts, so. Yeah. Oh, aren't they great people? But... They are donating to charity. You cock sucker. Jeff, you want to go into detail about what the event was a little bit? I want to explain it. It's a... It's a few groups of local indie game developers who all sort of share space in the city. And they were having a little holiday party. And because they sort of know Tom and who... Fulp. Fulp, Tom Fulp, who made Castle Crashers and I'm working with Tom and, you know, all of us sort of know each other. We all kind of went as a group hoping to have a lot of fun with a bunch of indie game developers. But you're crazy indie guys. But you're crazy guys. Now, I have to say, Jeff never drinks. But before this event he drank and I knew. I saw the fear of Jeff's eyes. I saw the horror. That was Corey. Oh yeah, Corey also... Corey got so drunk at the Chinese restaurant we had before. He was grabbing rice with his bare hands like a monkey and stopping it into his face. He was making rice balls. He was mashing it into white balls. Yeah, and he was like drooling on himself. But we do this Christmas party. I went outside for a smoke and he swapped the beer out of my... He drank Stamper's beer and poured hot tea in Stamper's empty beer bottle. And he thought it was the funniest shit. He was laughing so hard. To be fair. Like he got me good. We were all up pretty hard. I think he's a real psycho sometimes. He's a fucking nut bar. Anyways, continue. So yeah, we hung out at this holiday party. I don't know, is there any notable things that you guys noticed? A lot of flannel shirts and beers. A lot of flannel shirts. The one thing I noticed was, before Jeff and I went, I said, Jeff, I have an idea of the kind of people this will be since it's indie gamers. A lot of people have an image for these guys. Generally hipster would be the word. And so I said, Jeff, I wonder how many guys would be wearing thick rimmed, horny glasses. And I counted. And I kind of put it together. I thought, how many guys, how many percentage of the population actually wears glasses? Now I counted about 36 thick rimmed glasses. And then I was like, there's so many guys with thick rimmed glasses, I started counting guys who had regular glasses. Four guys had regular glasses.

Yeah, I'll go he just wants to drink. Yeah, he was he always over does it He's like, well, there's gonna be alcohol there, right? And I'm like, I probably he's like, well, I'm gonna He was really fucking drunk a couple days ago, right? I'm vodka. You were saying yeah, he's making up words He does that sober. Yes. He had so he had syllables the premises words when you get drinks too much It's I'm sure it's not unique to drunk people, but not calling him a drunk I'm just saying he was he was working really hard on this project we're working on and he just he just Just had to get hammered one night and just continue working and he was Totally out of it, but he was still animating fine. It's just the mentally it was about there But if you record these what he adds s's to words that don't have s's Wawa's what else does he do at Corey? He does it all the time? There's a bunch of words that I can't remember one. I wonder if people even know who the fuck we're talking about You know we get in this trap and we start to oh, you know, I like Corey Corey this and Corey that Corey Spazka from the podcast I know but you'd have to know that ahead of time because we just start casually talking about Corey Yeah, you never heard the podcast you'd be like who who's that? Yeah, Corey from the podcast loveable friends spaz kid who Loves chris chan and hot memes fresh off the press Speaking of getting the really drunk jeff. What's the drugiest you've ever been?

He was like dude, if you point that camera at me one more time, I'm gonna I'm gonna kick you in the mouth. I He was sitting like any style on the ground and you're standing up looking down at him Yeah, and then everyone in that little circle just shut up because I don't know what it was serious Noxious because they like blinded me in one eye and I'm just like what the fuck you're doing You got snapping pictures of you with the flash on at night time. Yeah, well. He was going on taking pictures of everyone But it was just I remember who it was but I'm not gonna say yeah No, he didn't even ask he just stuck the camera in my face in the flash for an off My eyes were all adjusted to the dark and now I can't see shit. It was harmless But you did is but I sort of felt bad about it But uh, that's probably not the drunkest I've ever been but that's for the drug That's the situation where the alcohol probably most affected my behavior Last year last bank fest, which is a convention if you don't know about it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:30:55.290 --> 1:38:03.949]: 
  And he's like, yeah, you know, he's like, you're right. People have set up a lumberjack. And I'm like, yeah, you just, you just look like some asshole in the woods and just chops down trees all day. That's what you look like. And I'm laughing to myself. And he's just like, huh, huh. He's trying to keep the situation like calm and like make sure. And it's like a borderline bully thing to do. I was bullying him. I was bull. I was polite. Oh, yeah, he's trying to be polite. This is a fine line between taking stabs of people and bullying. And I said, and I, and I, and I just kept taking it. And I said, you know, it's like, I'm just thinking right now. I'm just like, if I had an axe, I just can't decide if I want to chop your head off like horizontally, like through like your upper and lower jaw or vertically cut your head in half. By the way, as he says that he's like making a swipe emotion, I like an inch away from his face with his hand. I'm making an axe motion with my hands. I'm like, I was fucking dialing. And he's like, it was so comfortable to watch. He's like, wait, so you, oh, wait, you're going to cut me off, cut my head off at the neck? And I'm like, no, no, like, great. Three years. Your upper and lower teeth. Yeah. Right in the middle. Kind of like comedically, or, you know, like, or like cut me down the center. I can't really decide. And I'm laughing and nobody else is laughing. And then I was comfortable. And then Mr. Hang. I thought it was funny. That's all that matters. It is pretty funny, though. No, what about you? I apologize. I apologize. And stop. You got a you got a backfist one, too, Zach. Maybe boy. I do. It was the year before that last one, which was MacFest, because it happens in January. So that the one the Jeff was, I was MacFest 2014. But the one I was at was 2013, the year before that. And listen, I like to drink sometimes and I had whiskey. I've never seen you that drunk, but I was I. Well, you come into the story too, a little bit. OK. And I think you want to talk about. I'm not sure. I mean, you'll get flashbacks here and still get fucking PTSD from this. But basically, Stanford was with some black chick and those two would show you bad. It was me and Christian on your bed. And you know, when you get drunk, you stop tasting the alcohol. So you get you get more drunk, especially with like whiskey or vodka. You see like your taste buds fucking die. You have problems to drink more. So they were I don't know why whiskey was a little bit. I think I think Mac rice pirate ordered whiskey to the room and I started having it. I ordered. Dude, you cleared like half a bottle of Woodford Reserve by yourself. I ordered coke to the place. I wanted to go to the room and I was like, fucking I was like slandering. I was like, damn, I don't like it. Was a god. I would keep doing this. I get drunk. And by the way, this was the night before we were supposed to do a panel. Yeah. So we had a panel plan. Yeah, we were celebrated, pre-celebrating the panel we were going to do in the morning. I'm drinking this stuff. I stop. I lose my taste buds and I'm getting more and more. And with vodka or like heavy liquors, it's also like just it all hits you at once. It keeps coming at you. It takes like 20 to 30 minutes to really hit you. So it's kind of like a delay. It's like a debt. It was up drinking this stuff, drinking this stuff. And I didn't black out. But after a while, I was like lying in the bed and my fucking head was spinning. And I was standing in the bed with that black chick. And I was like making noises. I think they were fooling around. I can't make it fart noises. Like I was like, it was laughing to myself. And she was like, stop, make him stop. And she was like, if you can't do that, we're going to stop it. We heard like, I was like, she's like, that's it. I'm done. Anyways, thanks, Zach. I couldn't get to sleep. So it said you stood laughing like a little little boy. At this point, I stopped drinking all the fucking whiskey hit me. And I only had like a half a bottle of this whiskey. I couldn't sleep. But I got up and I was like, oh, my God. And I was so drunk that I'm pretty sure it's I was a drunk where it's like, you say, you're like, oh, my God, I sort of say it to sort of talk to myself. Oh, my God. And I like grabbed, fumbled them for a laptop in the bag. I had like the television. And I went in the bathroom and I took a big shit. And I just said, I probably sat there like with my head wobbling back to the point still at the wall for like 10 minutes, but I didn't realize anything. And I got my laptop. I was like, what do I do? And I got in Skype and I was going to enjoy it from the laptop. So I tried to see who's on Skype and Jeff was on Skype. And he did the breakfast that year and I called Jeff and I was like, hey, Jeff, you know, it's coming back to me. Yes, I was super drunk. I was like, there was a big like rotting shit below my body. You know where I am right now? Yes, where I'm on the toilet. Yes, I kept saying, I see what they remember. I was like, Jeff, I got a big shit. My balls are hanging down above the shit. And I kept so hooked on that. It's weird. Yeah, technology. Amazing. I don't know. I keep on watching you. I swear, you go, yeah, yeah, you probably fuck with me. What would you even what? What do you recall from that? That's all I remember. I don't know why I called you, but you were like working. I was like, what are you doing? Yes, what are you doing? Jeff, you guess what I'm doing? Ah, I'm thinking a shit. Yeah. So anyways, I like I was like, I was feeling I was right. Talking to workers for like 30 minutes. I was probably saying the same thing over and over. And I was like, I see you later. I slammed the laptop and I was like, man, this cold, this floor sure is cold. And I laid on the floor and I went, I fucking puked. And I was like, I puked nasty, but this floor is still cold. I'm going to bed. And the next thing I remember is like, like two hours later, Corey opening the door of the bathroom and hitting my fucking head. And I was like, I remember Corey looking down at me and I was like, he was like, you're going to do the panel. And I was like, no, I closed the door and I cleaned the. I like he was concerned that you were dying on the. Oh, it's covered in my own vomit. Go do the panel. Yeah. And anyways, it was like my jacket was ruined. I would I would I crawled back into the bed and I laid on my back and fucking passed out. Instead, you were to tell from your perspective where it goes from there. Yeah, we went down downstairs to or we were all getting organized to go to the panel and we were trying to wake you up the whole time. We were screaming in your face and shaking you and slapping you and trying to wake you up. And you were you were completely out. Yeah. And we were like, fuck him. We'll just go do the panel without him. And we went downstairs and we did the panel. And there's a room was filling up with people. I remember thinking, man, Zach had a lot to drink and he wasn't responding to any of that physical violence. I think he might be dead. And then the panel started and we were like, hey, guys, how's it going? Didn't even think about you anymore. Yeah, no, no. You got pissed like the asshole you are. No, here's what happened, dude. I was drunk for like 24 hours after I had the mjokal. Thanks for doing the panel without me. Yes. So I woke up when I was like so drunk and I was like, I smell the shit. And I was like, oh, they fucking did the panel without me. I text Chris, I was like, fuck you. Because I was looking for the panel. And then they Christ brought me up a fresh bottles of water and I took a shower and I kind of got a cup of beer. He's a great guy. Dude, there was vomit everywhere, man. You had like five bags of omelette clothes. It was nasty. That I had a good jacket that I ruined. But anyways, I got sober by the day. But it was like 7 p.m. And even at 7 p.m., we were out eating dinner and every five minutes, excuse me, I fucking puked in the bathroom, come back out. Yeah. It was horrible. That was the last away whiskey. That's a hangover, man. Yeah, man. You went to, you puked, passed out, had no water, got back in the bed, still had no water. You're paying for that shit. You play, you pay. I did a very bad thing with that. Should we talk about mixed drunken escapades and breakfasts? Which one? Oh. And for those that are mixed, the creepy, molester guy who talks the beginning of the podcast. Not Stanford, the other one. The other one.

  There is a world where I don't know the kids but sorry

 SPEAKER_01 [1:38:05.232 --> 1:38:53.663]: 
  They're right. We're not the kids, but here is a warrior. Now, Mick is a very nice guy. He's one of our good friends. Mick Rice Pirate. Wonderful gentleman. Hard-working, talented fellow. Even though he's Asian, we still like him. You know, like, is Luke CK's Mexican, you can't tell. Just like Mick is Asian, and you can't tell. Well, he's like, kind of tell. Is Mick like half Asian? Yeah. He's got features, but he's not Asian. I'd never be able to tell. But he's like tall and buff. So like, in Japan, I think, they worship Asian people and half Western people. They think they're like the magical hybrids. Honestly, they do. All the movie stars are like, Mick's. They all kind of look like that, too. Anyways, go do it, Mick's crazy. I was in the non-complimenting Mick. He looks great. Fuck Mick. He's great in jeans. Jeans, he looks great. Yes, he's very handsome. His face is all right.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:38:13.332 --> 1:38:14.007]: 
  Hardworking.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:38:15.458 --> 1:38:16.673]: 
  Even though he's Asian, we still like him.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:38:21.972 --> 1:38:22.444]: 
  You can't tell.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:38:22.444 --> 1:38:24.081]: 
  Well, you need to kind of tell.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:38:27.591 --> 1:38:28.789]: 
  I'd never be able to.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:38:36.990 --> 1:38:40.163]: 
  They think they're like the magical hybrid. Honestly, they do.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:38:39.387 --> 1:38:39.505]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:38:45.816 --> 1:38:46.508]: 
  Wow.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:38:46.508 --> 1:38:54.203]: 
  What's a non-complimenting Mick? He looks great. Fuck Mick. He's very handsome. In jeans, he looks great. Yes, he's very handsome. His face is alright.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:38:55.688 --> 1:42:45.812]: 
  He's like a butter face. There's a nice butt, you know. If his butt looked more like his face, and his face looked more like his butt. Oh! Anyway. I'm just kidding. He's a very, very handsome fella. Anyway, so I always knew, I always assumed he was a pretty level-headed guy. This is one thing that occurred at Magfest that I really was not expecting, but, and I missed the whole thing. I basically came into the story after it all happened, but apparently, I don't know, I'm not sure who challenged him, too, but him and one of Chris's Irish friends, was it Maddy? No, it was Patty. Patty. Patty. They decided to go outside while it was freezing cold and snowing out. They'd have a bare-knuckle boxing. Rip their shirts off and have a bare-knuckle fight in the snow outside. Like, they were not friendly. They're not having like these friendly little jabs. They were really going. It was a fight. But they don't hate each other. It was just like, hey, let's get all the sexual tension out. It's like this shit in like gangs in New York, they're out in the snow, like doing their 1930s boxing style. Yeah, they were clipping each other in the face hard and laughing every day. I was like, what is this psycho shit? And it was the one time I was so pissed off at my phone. You don't like those times where the one and only time you need your fucking phone to work. It's not fucking working. Sitting there with all the capability to fucking film this thing, because it's the most bizarre thing I've ever seen in my fucking life. And of course, all I have is Kodak memories in my mind. Hey, Elise, you weren't making your memories behind the veil of a screen, and at least they're in your brain. Listen, Linus, if you don't shut the fuck up. So if you want to recall what I don't, but basically I heard, yeah, Mick fucked up his hand, and then he body slammed Patty. I heard he lifted him up and threw him. Yeah, he picked up Patty like a bag of trash and threw him. Patty's a little guy, but he likes to think that he's this huge big tank. But he's like. He is a tank. He's a little scrapper, dude. The thing is, he's like he's like five foot eight, and he's muscular and like he's pretty muscular. Like he's fit looking, but it's like. Gourass. Mick is like six foot three and just fucking beef. Yeah, there's no way Patty would ever. Mick doesn't have a six pack, but he's fucking built. You could run ahead versus the Mick and the breakers. Oh, Mick has, Mick has dad body or man body. Man body. Oh yeah, floating slip right there. And I honestly couldn't tell who was going to win that. Patty could have gone either way. It's like six to six to and like, isn't he? He's tall. Honestly, I didn't think size mattered in that at all. He weighs more. He weighs like 200 something. Oh yeah, he weighs like Patty would weigh 150 at most. Yeah. Yeah, but Patty probably has more. What's it called? Muscle. Like not muscle of endurance. Yeah. He's like a little Tasmanian devil. Yeah. Scott, you do make just drinks a lot and record voices. In street fighter terms, it was like fey long versus Zangief or something. How about that? Yeah, there you go. So yeah, I don't know. They pretty much beat the shit out of each other and then kind of came back inside. Got a drink and I missed all of it. They didn't even want to build up an audience. They just went outside alone like psychos and fought and came back inside. Yeah, Mick was like, how bad is my eye? I can't bend my finger. And I used to be Patty for the rest of the night. His finger was fucked up for like six months, dude. I think it's still fucked up. It was like in a self-splint. It was just straightforward. He couldn't bend it and it was all swollen and purple and weird. Yeah, that was that. Welcome to MAG Fest, the happiest place on earth. Speaking of the happiest place on earth, I went to Disney World about a while ago. No, I can't do it like that, can I? Yeah, you can. No, what's that? That was a really good segue. Holidays are a time for couples and love and all sorts of fun things. Reflections on your past mistakes. Nile decided to go to Disney World at the love of his life. Continue, Nile. Well, I don't know. The wounds are still fresh, man. OK? I'll tell it on the point. Great. Goddamn. You guys are fucking assholes. OK.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:38:55.992 --> 1:38:58.084]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:39:27.717 --> 1:39:29.100]: 
  No, it was Patty. Patty.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:40:46.945 --> 1:40:48.649]: 
  He's a tank, he's a little scrapper dude.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:40:54.505 --> 1:40:55.062]: 
  And I give our moral

 SPEAKER_00 [1:41:06.689 --> 1:41:07.937]:

Speaking of Mick what actually I got really drunk that night I was watching mixed Dark Souls playthrough on Twitch that night And I was just kind of drinking while I was watching it and I was doing other stuff too and When she came home I was like I was pretty fucking hammered and then I was like fine Let's just break up so I was kind of drunk at the time too and like I don't oh god So like it made it kind of worse. Oh, and then you got back together and then you were like can I have your back baby? She was like yeah, and she was like wait, that's milk fuck on your breath and my eye Do you think this trip was actually preventing you guys from breaking up because you're like oh well We can't break up because we're going to Disney World. No no just sort of happen No, cuz we still we got on so fucking we still get on really well like it wasn't like we didn't fight It wasn't a fight break up at all.

I couldn't help it So I was just like you said you took one picture with your girlfriend or your ex-girlfriend You said Mickey your goofy so his goofy grabbed her ass.

Yeah, it was Was it just being alone you just felt sad for being alone or just not having her not having her That's the only reason was just not having her and then you get the thing the other guy Did you go to a window and put a box on your head? Did you start imagining other dudes? Yeah, still do yeah I still do man come on Putting a scalpel to the sky right now man No, like I logically know it was for the best but It still doesn't like like my my body doesn't doesn't relate like doesn't care.

Not presents, not the food, not the vacations, but things as simple as spending time with family and friends. Friends like you guys.
