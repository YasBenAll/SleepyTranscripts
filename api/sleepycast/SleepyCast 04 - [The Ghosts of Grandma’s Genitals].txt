  They were made to make your butthole warm.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:50.854 --> 0:07:56.997]: 
  Maybe it was like muscles for the back or something and then they happened to be what we sit on now because we were always bipedal

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:56.997 --> 0:08:11.948]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:09.465 --> 0:10]: 
  But it's like, what I was tracing earlier was not all people with deformities are ugly, but when people say they're beautiful, like super amazing, it's like, you know, they play somebody with Purgier near next to like, uh, Kardashian.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:15.570 --> 0:23:24.227]: 
  When you get purebred dogs and you breathe them with each other, they all end up being inbred. So like, each generation is like more fucked up than blood.

You know the way some people like do actually rub peanut butter on their ass and let their dog lick it? Yeah. Like are there like peanut butter families, like people that do it in the family? Like more than one person. You mean like the dad will do it? Like yeah, the dad will do it and think he's like really discreet and then the son will do it and be like hey hey but he's really getting his dad's doodoo and his bum. That's gross. Oh like everyone's keeping it a secret but the dog is tossing everyone's salad. Yeah, yeah and the dog's like hey hey hey, yeah he's having a great time. And the mom's doing it too.

  Who ate all the peanut butter? Yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:49.024 --> 0:24:58.947]: 
  And then there'd be peanut butter around the dog's mouth, but peanut butter and a little bit of darker peanut butter, which you wouldn't really know. I wonder if there would be a market on like dog peanut butter, and who would the demographic be? We need dog peanut butter.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:58.947 --> 0:25:00.044]: 
  I put it for dogs.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:59.706 --> 0:25:17.982]: 
  Yeah, yeah if they sold like just innocent peanut butter for dogs who would the demographic of that be a heartless I went to a dog store once they had a whole dessert rack for dogs They had little dog cupcakes and dog pies and stuff who shows a dog. So who do you think? Who do you think? By the way, who shows people that love their dogs dog? Why do you want your dog? You have dog? You don't know?

  Can you put it down?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:41.438 --> 0:25:59.005]: 
  Thought that if you wanted to kill somebody the best thing you could do is get a big dog like a Rottweiler German Shepherd something right and you train them to jump on people while they're at the top of the stairs So the dog kills them push them down the stairs. Oh that is like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:59.005 --> 0:26:03.949]: 
  What if the guy falls and kills your dog but the guy survives and your dog dies?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:03.882 --> 0:26:14.817]: 
  then you're looking at a fucking if there's a whole wave of people dying by dogs being pushed in the stairs it's all gonna come back to you no, it's just the one person that you're gonna go to jail you're sitting on the couch and you're like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:10.581 --> 0:26:17.247]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:37.497 --> 0:26:42.711]:

Yeah, no, I worked at McDonald's and it was the worst job ever and I got so much empathy from working there. What was your job at McDonald's? I was a crew member, so essentially I fucking changed the bins and I like made burgers and shit and gave out free burgers to my friends and got caught and got fired. But then... That's not a job! No, but that's what happened. And then I was a waiter, I told Stamper this and I pretended I was a waiter before, so I pretended I had experience, but I didn't know how to wait a table and they caught me and I got fired. And then my other job, I got fired as well because I there was this guy and he was like my my Indian manager and he told me that I wasn't allowed to go to the toilet and I was like this is bullshit. And I went to the toilet anyway and he got mad at me and I was like it's my human right to go to the toilet and it sounded like a fucking faggot so he ran me out the door. And then... Yeah, that was my last kind of proper job. You're fired for peeing! Chris! Oh no, then I got fired! Oh man, I got fired so much! I got fired two more times. One time I was working in this retailer called Debenhams and I was really tired and I crawled under a clothes rack and fell asleep for eight hours. And then when I was crawling out, I was looking up my manager's skirt accidentally. And then she fired me. Fuck this fuck. I don't believe that.

Big dirty uncle? Big dirty uncle. That's his full name by the way. Big dirty uncle. What was his name? First name big, middle name dirty, last name uncle. Okay. Anyways, big dirty uncle, Junior gave us this computer. It was the only computer in the house we had in my brother's room. And he didn't clearly leave the off. So my dad was like, here you can play computer, you can go out there. And we went out of the computer, he left a bunch of pictures of naked ladies with the big titties out. Big fucking titties. My brother was a little boy, he got freaked out, he didn't know how to handle it. So the only thing he could think of to do was to print off the naked ladies and he slid them under my parent's door. What? He was like, he was trying to say, well you know what the fuck is this? But he never, he never like, he just slid under it and we left, it was a lie about it. They never said anything about it, we never heard anything back, it just kind of went undiscovered. So my parents came home one day and just found like a naked lady picture and they were like, huh? And they probably threw it away and they were like, what?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:31.994 --> 0:37:45.662]: 
  You know when you're a kid and you don't really like it, when was the first time you realized you couldn't cry when you needed to? Yeah. You know what I mean? When you're like, oh, like, you know, when you're a teenager, you're a little older, you're like, oh, I need to, I should be sad, but I'm not, I should be sadder than I am.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:44.127 --> 0:37:57.677]: 
  I should be sadder than I am. Dude, it's just like being close to like certain members of your family. Dude, it's... I was but I'm saying... I thought my family could die and I wouldn't care. But that's what I'm saying. Where did you first realize that? I mean, I'd care but I wouldn't fucking...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:49.797 --> 0:37:50.894]: 
  I was but I'm saying

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:53.492 --> 0:37:55.973]: 
  Where did you first realize that?

  Where did you first realize that? Where did you first go? Got it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:59.719 --> 0:38:02.892]: 
  I kind of broke down my emotions like should I be crying right now?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:02.875 --> 0:38:10.182]: 
  But I, I, I, my grandma was like, everybody was really sad. I was like, oh God, I'm not sad. I, like, I should, I was bummed out, but I wasn't like, sad.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:10.182 --> 0:38:11.515]: 
  The Bundle counts.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:11.515 --> 0:38:28.626]: 
  But I was like everybody was like, you know, you're weeping. And I was like, oh, I need to, you know. So I was like, all right, what I'm going to do is I'm going to fake cry here. And I went, ah! And everybody looked at me. I was like, no, it's by. And I just shut up. And I didn't say anything about it. And nobody said anything about it either. And it came out just like that. I was like, oh.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:28.626 --> 0:38:34.245]: 
  I love how non-confrontational your family is. Like you just like weird shit and nobody ever says anything about it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:34.026 --> 0:38:43.965]: 
  Another thing that happens is like you need to go and say goodbye to her. She's gonna pass away the next couple hours. And I went in and you know what something's really dark? Like you're trying to make out something you're looking at and you're squinting and you're getting closer.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:43.425 --> 0:38:45.062]: 
  Closer? I have to think about that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:45.062 --> 0:39:33.325]: 
  It's like, oh, is that is that thing on my desk right there? Is there somebody sleeping on that bed or whatever you're kind of squinting to see if it's there? Yeah, I we all went in her room But the lights were different because she was dying she wouldn't fucking bright lights blind here and I was on the edge Of the bed and she was laying there with her legs spread I was like is she wearing underwear? I was like trying to see if she was wearing underwear so I can notify and tell somebody hey her exposed pussies hanging out You know close the legs or put a blanket over something and I was expecting looking at it before I can even see to clarify My aunt's looked at me with oh, and she threw a blanket over my grandmother's crotch Oh, no, she thought I was trying to look at her pussy like my aunt thought I was trying to look at my grandma's pussy while She was dying and I never I never talked to my aunt that like She just assumed I was staring at her pussy taking advantage of her man. I did this day. It's still like it's completely up in the air

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:50.665 --> 0:38:51.036]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:33.156 --> 0:39:54.435]:

  I can't be white, do whatever you want.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:02.451 --> 0:40:35.020]: 
  Yeah, this one time I was in a bank lobby and there was a big stuffed taxidermy goat and I was there with my either my grandma or my mom and When I saw the goat I was like yeah And then I ran over to the goat and I got down on my hands and knees to see if they taxidermy this wiener And like if his wiener was still there, it's all I was looking up under and then one of the bank tellers was like It's like pointing the laughing at me like the funniest things she ever saw and then I got really nervous I probably shouldn't be doing that at the end

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:17.820 --> 0:44:18.040]: 
 謝謝

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:19.896 --> 0:44:22.225]: 
  I still am the sub-degree.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:22.259 --> 0:45:01.223]: 
  Aliens made me sleep with my light on from the age of 12 to probably the age of 14 because I was convinced I was gonna be taken away. It didn't help. Was this when you live in Alaska? This is when I live in Alaska I don't blame you. I lived in the country in the winter time when it was dark most of the year and I was convinced that I was good It was just gonna it was imminent because my parents were I wouldn't say they were workaholics But they worked their asses off so they they worked like 14 hour days And I barely ever saw them that come home from school and it would just be me and my sister and my brother in this big house My son I don't think my sister gave a shit. Maybe she was afraid of all the aliens I was terrified aliens and it didn't help that I watched the documentary or

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:35.472 --> 0:44:35.792]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:41.715 --> 0:44:42.897]: 
  It was just like it was imminent.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:56.582 --> 0:44:57.595]: 
  darkness

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:01.037 --> 0:45:02.590]: 
  Or finally the sky.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:02.590 --> 0:45:58.649]: 
  And Fire in the Sky. That fucking movie dude. Fire in the Sky is a horrible movie. I haven't seen it but I've seen signs and that's kinda... You know I mean horrible in a sense where like if you watch... Don't watch it if you wanna sleep. Yeah, it's a fucking terrifying movie. And there's another movie with Christopher Walken called Communion. And it's a little corny and it's really cryptic but there's some scenes in that movie that'll fucking terrify you. But I saw this home, lost home footage video called the McPherson Abduction. I don't know if you ever saw that. If you watched it now it would be completely laughable. But when I was a kid, the McPherson Abduction video... Fuck it, it was like a mocky... It was a fake documentary, right? Okay. Where like people were like, yeah we don't know what happened to these people and they show another clip or the footage or whatever. And it was just like aliens kinda sequentially stealing members of this family and like some kid was walking around with this. And I thought that I was doomed man. I had to like convince myself as I was sleeping like nobody's gonna come. Yeah but why would they just... I've looked at you of all people, why would they say... Because these are the people...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:03.653 --> 0:45:04.007]: 
  Fuck

  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:54.869 --> 0:45:56.370]: 
  Why would they just do this place?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:57.467 --> 0:45:59.864]: 
  Because these are the middle of Alaska.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:59.290 --> 0:46:29.901]:

Yeah, it's like well It would be a fucking little Chinese girl who was a slave in 1200. Yeah, like why does everybody assume that reincarnation?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:29.901 --> 0:47:04.495]: 
  I used to be paranoid that my whole family was gonna die. Just generally, so I prayed and I went to bed. Every night I prayed to God, I'd say, I literally say, God, please let my family live until tomorrow, they name every single person in my immediate family, in my secondary family. All my cousins and aunts, all girls, they'd be like, please don't kill them. You don't feel guilty because you left somebody out? What do you mean? Like left them out of the house? No, you left somebody out of your prayers. Oh, I did, I was like, oh, fuck, yeah. What if they died? Would that make you believe in God? If I was like 12 or 13, I did that, I'd love somebody out, they died.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:53.492 --> 0:46:55.214]: 
  No, that's somebody out of your prayers.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:04.495 --> 0:47:07.414]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:06.722 --> 0:47:12.038]: 
  If I could tip by a car, I would probably still be rolling just to the state that happened. That would probably would have traumatized me.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:12.612 --> 0:47:15.936]: 
  Guys, guys, I gave you all fuck you Zach

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:15.936 --> 0:47:17.320]: 
  Yeah, that'll teach you next time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:16.864 --> 0:47:18.501]: 
  Really, Uncle Jack? Fuck you!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:18.501 --> 0:47:33.334]: 
  I'm trying to think of something terrifying music that actually terrified me. Yeah, I mean the regular stuff, ghosts, I remember... I've never been afraid of ghosts. I always saw ghosts coming in my room. I saw demons, like a demon, like a scary ghost. The demons are fucking corny. Oh, I have a fucking...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:28.913 --> 0:47:29.554]: 
  Nebix

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:31.495 --> 0:47:37.114]: 
  The demons are fucking corny. If they do walk into my room with horns, and it's like I'm a demon, I'd be like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:34.988 --> 0:47:35.444]: 
  Oh, that's...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:35.444 --> 0:47:36.439]: 
  So grundgeschmissen.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:38.869 --> 0:47:41.620]: 
  Really? With your fucking horns asshole? Fuck off!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:41.384 --> 0:47:47.037]: 
  I guess I guess I've always been more paranoid about like realistic things like somebody breaking the house and fucking like cutting my throat or something

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:47.020 --> 0:48:08.940]: 
  Oh, like home invade like everyone's always afraid of aliens, but nobody ever thinks about home invasions I'm still to the state chair by the home invasions. No when When I woke up one day, there was a guy in my house and he ran away like I swear to God I got home invaded one day and when we saw you he was looking at me You know like a deer in the headlights and I woke up and I just looked at him as a and then he just ran out the door And he didn't steal anything. What was this about?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:51.053 --> 0:47:53.112]: 
  I'm still at this nature by the way.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:08.940 --> 0:48:11.539]: 
  years ago that I would have never been able to see

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:10.999 --> 0:48:53.929]: 
  Maybe he was going back to his old friend's house then. Well, he looked like he was wearing a cat burglar outfit. But like, white stripes. Yeah. He was wearing like all black and shit. But ghost story, when I was eight, this is actually true. I swear to God, I woke up and I felt someone beside me. And like, I don't believe in ghosts, but like this one was fucking scared me. There was someone beside me and I thought it was like my little sister or something. And I got up and I saw it was like a boy. And I was like, what the fuck? I don't have any brothers. And then like walked towards me and disappeared into a blue light. And then I ran into my parents room because I was scared shitless as I would be. And then I woke up in that room so I knew it was real. And that actually did happen. I guess it was sleep paralysis or some shit, but yeah, that really did happen. That fucking scared me for about 10 years.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:16.619 --> 0:48:17.952]: 
  Put it on your head like this.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:18.644 --> 0:48:19.167]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:50.115 --> 0:48:50.250]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:53.929 --> 0:49:42.242]: 
  I remember when I was probably 13 or 14 or something like that, I was with my cousin and we were upstairs in our room listening to... Like, we were playing games and it was like 12 o'clock at night and this is my recollection of it. I don't know how reliable this is, but we were like... That was stairs, we were people talking, we were like, what the fuck? All three of us were people talking, what the hell's going on? It was like a group of people talking. We went downstairs and we like... To my recollection, I saw a group of like semi-transparent people playing poker at my kitchen table and I was like, what the fuck? This is definitely... I remember, this definitely didn't happen. Like, I definitely misidentified something and then we saw... I saw that and I was like, what the fuck? And I went down and my cousin saw it too. Yeah. And we told our parents and they were like, you're fucking lying and you went downstairs and there's nobody there. And then your dad beat your ass. He beat my ass because we were lying. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:35.189 --> 0:49:35.526]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:40.150 --> 0:49:45.314]: 
  He peed my ass for coming to the line, yeah. But Zach, you told me I was fucking crazy for seeing a spaceship.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:45.600 --> 0:49:59.742]: 
  No, I said, I didn't say- That's true! That's true! Here's what I said. I said, you saw what you saw, but it was not a space alien. I saw what I saw, but I- I said- But I didn't see ghosts. You saw ghosts. I didn't see ghosts. Period. Ghosts. Zach, you told me before!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:59.742 --> 0:50:04.602]: 
  funny story once where you said that you were in a mansion and fucking a chair chased you down the stairs

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:04.872 --> 0:52:18.167]: 
  Oh, yeah, no, no, it's amazing whenever you read out my stories, they're so far off. I was in a mansion and a chair chased me down the stairs. Here's what really happens. I was at my grandma's house, and this is way after I stopped, like, you know, believing or being spiritual. I was like 16, 17. I went to my grandparents house and I was like, oh, we'll be right there in like five minutes. Just stay in the house. And I went in there, broad daylight, went to their house, sat in the living room. They have a bunch of modern furniture, and I saw like one of their rocking chairs started going back and forth slowly. I was like, what the fuck? I started, I got put back a little bit. I was like, what? This rock, I'm completely lower in the house. This rocking chair starts going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Then it starts getting really severe. Then I hear a bang, bang, bang. Then I hear footsteps. I shit my pants and run outside. And I waited in the driveway. I was like, well, we're not going to fuck back in there. I went back in. No good news in the house. And that house has a lot of weird stuff that happens in that place. My dad stayed there one time with his girlfriend who was visiting. And they were staying in the guest bedrooms. And my dad saw a huge, like, black lump next to his bed. And it, like, rose up. It went around them. It circled around the bed and sunk down. And my dad tapped his girlfriend on the shoulders. So what the fuck is that? He pointed at it. Then she saw it too. And it was like, it was like clearly walking around. It was like, it was like three or four feet up the ground walking around the bed. They freaked out, turned the light on, disappeared to them. And also there's one room in that house where whoever sleeps in it, everybody who slept in that room has confirmed whenever you sleep in that room, you fan it or you dream about killing people, going crazy and killing people, you know, it happened to me. I, I, I went, I stayed in that room and I had a dream that I fucking killed everybody. Very strange. And I'm not superstitious at all, but that, that, that rocking chair story, that, that happened to me. It's going to be the fuck out of me. I think that was the last thing that happened where I was like, okay, there could be. Oh, last, last story. I was with my brother one time, the home alone. And we were talking and I was, I said something kind of anti-religious as a joke. Like fuck God, he's a fat, what is he though? Like a minute later, my brother went back in his room and the fucking cross in the living room, which is nailed up, flipped him side down, the perfectly upside down. And I freaked out, you know, I was like, oh my God, it scared the hell out of me.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:18.437 --> 0:52:22.234]: 
  Do you remember when you stayed in Ireland with me? Why would God do petty shit like that?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:22.133 --> 0:52:25.845]: 
  I'm just scared the fuck out of you, it worked out of you, I- I- I- I missed my pants. Do you remember what I said?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:25.845 --> 0:52:27.870]: 
  what happened when you stayed in Ireland with me, Zach?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:27.820 --> 0:52:31.110]: 
  Yes, you want to drink until the story? You want to tell the story, Chris?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:31.110 --> 0:52:36.747]: 
  It was Zach, he stayed in my little flat. Right, remember Zach? Yes, yes, I was there.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:34.772 --> 0:52:38.215]: 
  Right, remember that? Yes, yes, I was there. I remember. I was there.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:38.215 --> 0:53:01.941]: 
  Anyways, he was staying with me in Ireland and he had his smelly bitch girlfriend staying too. They both stayed in the guest room. That's me! They stayed in the guest room and this is what happened. I go to bed, I wake up, walk into my kitchen, catch up all over the room, it exploded out of the press. And I was like, Zach, you were a fucking asshole. Why did you do this? And Zach came out of the bed with his little, little but morning one. He's like, what happened here? And I'm like, why did, why did, no, this guy's gonna be here!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:01.941 --> 0:53:04.439]: 
  come from just catch up all over the roof.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:03.780 --> 0:53:08.775]: 
  It was all over the walls. It was all over the floor and it looked like it exploded from the side.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:07.476 --> 0:53:09.501]: 
  You still have the picture Chris?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:09.501 --> 0:53:34.071]: 
  I still have the picture on it. Okay, there's a picture of that, but I lived in that apartment and there was a ghost. And Chris doesn't believe me, but it was a little girl and she lived in the fucking... Oh, fuck off with your cliche little girl. I know, because I... Dude, I heard her laughing. I know little girl is cliche, but it doesn't take away from the fact... Why would you ever be scared of a little girl ghost? I didn't write this. I didn't write this. This is... This is what happened. Come on, Lyle. It's not something that you write down. It's you. It happened to be a little girl.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:32.350 --> 0:53:38.239]: 
  It's your horny subculture to protect your little girl to the fuck you left.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:35.354 --> 0:53:36.434]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:37.109 --> 0:54:51.494]: 
  No, not attracted little girls, but it was a little it was a little girl I need more thanks to the tree. No, I'm attracted little boys, but still I was in the fucking cupboard right? The little girl was? You guys say cupboard. They say cabinet. Oh, yeah, so it's in the little cabinet right under the sink and that's happened to be we're near the ketchup So that's that's like a clue and watch out. She was laughing inside. No, no one day I heard her giggling one night and another night Chris was on his computer and there was a there was a clock that we never fucking use. Oh, yeah, and the clock was behind the microwave, right? Yeah, and then for some reason the clock was on the fucking wall the next or that night and it was working And it was at the right time and I was like, oh weird Chris must have put the clock on the wall But it had his ticking noise and I knew Chris never do that I was like, wait Chris doesn't like Chris wouldn't like a ticking noise But I think about it and then the next morning I woke up and the clock was on the the sofa and the batteries were out like as Chris would do if there was a ticking noise in the room and Which color go Chris, why did you like assemble a clock and put it back in one night? I'm gonna take it apart. Yeah, and take it apart and he was like, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I the ticking was annoying me and I was like, why are you sorry? I didn't put it up there And then he was like I didn't put it up there And we're the only two people that live there literally the only two people in the house Yeah, like it was okay. Yeah, but how's he's here's that?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:49.444 --> 0:53:49.782]: 
  the

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:57.983 --> 0:53:58.523]: 
  I was lucky.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:22.789 --> 0:54:23.869]: 
  I'm sorry, think about it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:36.104 --> 0:54:37.167]: 
  I'm gonna take it apart.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:47.477 --> 0:54:47.680]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:50.144 --> 0:54:50.447]: 
  How do you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:51.494 --> 0:55:07.440]: 
  the right time it was set to the right time that is good but then whatever I hear these stories I think if you will surpass death why would you go to a fucking Irish apartment yeah put batteries in a clock type it and put it on the wall just doing it makes me look I agree with you way better stuff in the afterlife

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:07.440 --> 0:55:10.495]: 
  I agree it makes no sense, but that's something that happens

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:10.495 --> 0:55:17.515]: 
  Even by storm it's like if I survive the afterlife, why would I rock a fucking chair back at both and scare somebody? Yeah, this is fucking funny.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:17.515 --> 0:55:54.893]: 
  I would do it if it was- If you had- You'd be bored out of your mind. Here's something that I can't explain. This is one of the most fucked up things that's ever happened to me, okay? Yeah. Close to when I first moved up to this area, right? Yeah. Kinda next to the place we live in now, right? I moved into a brand new apartment, brand new in every respect. It was built brand new and Jeff lived right next door and he lived in a brand new apartment. This is like newly constructed, right? When I first moved in there, I didn't have anything. I had my clothes and I had an air mattress. And I'm in the bedroom. It's a one bedroom apartment with a living room out front in the kitchen. It's essentially kind of a studio that has like a second-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:24.349 --> 0:55:24.754]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:54.690 --> 0:55:56.142]: 
  I-I-I just... yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:56.142 --> 0:56:58.680]: 
  So, I go into my bedroom and this is kind of in my, I'm fucking afraid of the dark phase because I was still afraid of the dark well now I don't care anymore because I'm a fucking alcoholic and my life is in shambles and I'm, but back then I actually valued my life. So, I leave my bedroom light on and it's got a dimmer switch so I put it like halfway down so the lights are kind of halfway dimmed and I get in the bed and then the only thing, I'm serious, the only thing I remember is a girl opens my closet door, doesn't creep it open, she comes out of my closet door completely naked with this long black hair that comes down to her waist, out of my closet walks over to the foot of my bed, sits down on my bed and then she turns around and looks at me, she doesn't have a face, her face is blank, there's no eyes, no nose, it's just a blank canvas and she's staring at me like this. How could she be staring if she had no eyes? Her head was sticking. Her face is looking at me asshole so she's clearly looking at me some way.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:07.887 --> 0:56:09.270]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:52.217 --> 0:56:52.335]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:53.955 --> 0:56:54.782]: 
  Take place.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:58.410 --> 0:57:01.499]: 
  Her head is fixated in your direction. And I'm not screaming.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:00.317 --> 0:57:12.130]: 
  And I'm not screaming, I'm not upset, I'm like trying to understand what I'm looking at because she's like me and her like locking faces And I don't really get what's going on. It's not terrifying at all

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:11.944 --> 0:57:12.889]: 
  It's puzzling.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:12.788 --> 0:57:26.355]: 
  And it's in the same exact room that I was in the same ambience and all that the lights and the bed and the everything It was like I I think I didn't know who this person was she came out and she looked at me and left and that was it

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:26.355 --> 0:57:28.870]: 
  Was your little heart palady crazy like crazy?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:28.229 --> 0:57:43.163]: 
  I'm waiting for the sun to rise after that. I'm fucking like 25 years old 26 years old You could sleep and I was sitting there holding my blankets like what the fuck just happened dude I because that happened granted it didn't happen. It's not you know

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:42.724 --> 0:57:45.829]: 
  He could have been sleep paralysis or your own loosey dreamy.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:45.829 --> 0:57:55.499]: 
  Yeah, I mean, obviously in the real world, I would have stood up and screamed shit in my pants, but like, so I was clearly dreaming, but it was like, but was I?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:55.499 --> 0:57:59.177]: 
  Yeah, because you wake up in the exact same setting.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:58.755 --> 0:58:18.617]: 
  I have the exact same setting, the exact same lights, the exact same everything and again like I didn't put enough emphasis on this But when she sat at the foot of my bed when I woke up I swore because it was an air mattress Yeah, like I said, and then I felt just shit lifting like this So I don't know if like my feet weren't a weird position where I like deflate. It's one of those things where it's like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:00.359 --> 0:58:00.612]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:09.606 --> 0:58:11.395]: 
  Like I said, in the next video, I'm going to show you how to install the lift off.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:17.470 --> 0:58:28.202]: 
  It's one of those things where it's like is your brain trying to figure out what the sensation is first or you know what I mean? So if I walk and slap you in the chest and you're gonna dream that you can shot in the chest like your brain's gonna figure out a way

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:28.202 --> 0:58:37.450]: 
  Yeah, I mean, I know I said explain this but I mean there's clearly like lots of Explosions but still it's spooky stuff. Yeah, there have to be. But it was like so coincidental and fucking

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:31.814 --> 0:58:35.307]: 
  Explosions, but still it's spooky stuff. It has to be.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:37.214 --> 0:58:41.500]: 
  If that happened to me, I probably couldn't sleep at night. I'll never forget that. Bullshit.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:39.407 --> 0:59:33.947]: 
  I'll never forget that but like that kind of happened to me too though the exact same situation where you're in your bed And then you you dream and then you're I was in the same room though And this isn't the one with the airplane either This was a separate time when I was in my flat and I was going to sleep paralysis But this time I had already gone to sleep paralysis So I was like I know exactly what's happening. Just don't imagine anything scary just fucking don't and then this fucking thing Materialized at the end of my bed and it was like this big tall black. It was like a little tiny man No, it was Black mass right and I had these four big long things going into the floor So I assume like big long arms and big long legs and had this tiny little white face, right? And it was fucking scary and I was like, oh my god like a little doll mask. Yeah, it was just Leaning towards me. I was like this is fucking. Oh my god. Can't you close your eyes? I'm saying if you close your eyes, you're still dreamy. It doesn't make a difference. So you just kind of sit there and wait for it to wear

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:22.320 --> 0:59:22.928]: 
  Ja, het was een...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:22.928 --> 0:59:24.430]: 
  Was that the screen that was turned on?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:25.459 --> 0:59:25.965]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:28.294 --> 0:59:29.864]: 
  Can't you close your eyes?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:33.947 --> 0:59:36.951]: 
  But anyways, does it make it a little bit different?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:36.951 --> 0:59:45.439]: 
  Well, I could, but I didn't- like, if you're gonna close your eyes and you could- It's- in my head it's like, if I close my eyes, I'm gonna see the fucking exorcist girl in my dreams or something, so I was just like- I'm so-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:44.916 --> 0:59:52.763]: 
  I'm so fucking neurotic and like paranoid that my brain would do something way worse like pick the worst parts of my brain That's what happened to me with the X system

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:50.738 --> 1:00]: 
  That's what happened to me with the Axis system. But right and it started leaning towards me and then it just fucking then I was able to sit up and I was like it's gone cool But uh, yeah, and then afterwards I like typed in what it was to Google and it was so weird Well, no actually I told Sean what it was and he told me that it was like the common symbol for God or something I was like that's fucking God rest his soul Sean.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00 --> 1:00:36.165]: 
  I had a really scared you a couple nights ago, because it was super realistic. Yeah, but what was it? Oh, you know, so I've been like for back. You actually have to tell people after you say it. Anyway, no, but I've been like watching for back. I know he's like cold water stuff and one or two stuff because it's good to listen to. I watched the movie called Threads. It's a British movie. Yeah, the nuclear war one. Yeah, it's a nuclear war movie. It's super.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:22.986 --> 1:00:23.526]: 
  Anyways.

  I don't believe I'm saying you do you do just cuz you're shouting over me You're superior

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:40.995 --> 1:05:50.715]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:59.946 --> 1:06:00.469]: 
  What the fuck?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:10.105 --> 1:06:14.290]: 
  of you any different because you're cut or you any different because you're differently that you're freaks okay yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:11.860 --> 1:06:12.957]: 
  I don't think you need to do it differently.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:13.716 --> 1:06:17.547]: 
  Yeah, but Chris you really believe you're sexy

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:15.994 --> 1:06:49.947]: 
  I'm gonna tell you something that- The only reason you self lubricate is because your precom is rolling around inside your- Dude, I got so much precom- No, no, no, I get precom when I fucking think of it. It's weird. We don't understand that. No, a force- even without like lube- I've never- I've literally never used lube before. If you put your foreskin up against the pussy, right, it has room to come back so your dick goes in. And slides in is beautiful. That doesn't make any sense. It does. It's completely reliant on the female in question. No, listen, because the foreskin acts as the lube. Look, step- They really think because they have little legs like that quarter to-

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:21.715 --> 1:06:24.229]: 
  Dude, I got so much preco. No, no, no, I get preco when I do.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:28.380 --> 1:06:31.587]: 
  I've never, I've literally never used loop before.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:42.741 --> 1:06:43.939]: 
  No, listen, because...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:45.475 --> 1:06:53.474]: 
  Look, they're really thick because they have little eggs like that quarter to the skin. They have a million percent better sex. No, they're gone. Your head is the vagina, right?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:49.947 --> 1:06:50.993]: 
  Scare them a bleed for some reason

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:50.993 --> 1:07:05.320]: 
  better sex your head is the vagina right look the foreskin is stopped but now the peepee comes out it's because it's natural lubrication yeah yeah nothing to do with the location I hear your dick come in never

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:01.742 --> 1:07:08.459]: 
  I heard it! That's your dick coming out of the skin! Is that the only way you ever use lube? Don't put your fingers in my eye!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:07.581 --> 1:07:46.005]: 
  The only way that you guys can get the same sensation as us is if the girl queeps on your dick while it's inside because that's when the air Pushes out. That's the same as the like skin. It's not water based. Your dick doesn't your foreskin doesn't secrete water But I'm not saying it though Lubrication because it helps it slide in helps us slide in then it comes back out Okay, okay, just imagine picture this really really as vividly as possible. I'm trying to not so so I just did it for me Ignored it. I think of my didn't ignore it. It's nonsense think of my brilliant fucking Oncut dick right going into a pussy right and when it goes in right the pussy pulls back the skin Uh-huh and then when it comes back out the so what?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:25.047 --> 1:07:25.857]: 
  It does it!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:25.857 --> 1:07:26.245]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:30.008 --> 1:07:32.134]: 
  I'm trying to not.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:32.134 --> 1:07:35.442]: 
  I just did it for him, he's fucking ignored it. I didn't ignore it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:35.442 --> 1:07:35.948]: 
  It's not...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:46.005 --> 1:07:53.430]: 
  It doesn't matter your foot it makes the Are you telling me your foreskin is the like of your entire cock? No, but it's like that. It's about

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:48.250 --> 1:07:49.499]: 
  It feels better.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:53.430 --> 1:08:01.193]: 
  that long when it comes back it'll come back a long way. Zach if you aren't cut you'd agree with us because when you are like there's no reason to get you to-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:01.007 --> 1:08:04.450]: 
  The argument is that I can't really, cause I've got, I have a point skater.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:03.387 --> 1:08:13.596]: 
  First of all, it wasn't a choice, alright? No, okay, first of all, it's not a choice, but second of all, I don't understand, you're like, why, what is the point in getting the tip of the top of your dick cut off?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:05.243 --> 1:08:05.800]: 
  All right.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:13.326 --> 1:08:16.499]: 
  How's that defending big cutting baby's cucks off?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:16.499 --> 1:08:32.513]: 
  Yes, but it does act as a lubrication because he's talking about lubrication You're not thinking of it as water, but it's not liquid I already did this He's talking about a sliding mechanism Look, if that's the force thing, that's my cup tan You know what my sliding mechanism is? It's my dick I push it in

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:19.636 --> 1:08:20.363]: 
  What are you trying to do?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:21.544 --> 1:08:22.202]: 
  keep it open!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:22.995 --> 1:08:25.577]: 
  He's not talking about liquid lubrication.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:29.492 --> 1:08:33.812]: 
  My sliding mechanism is, is my disc. I push it in. If this gets, we don't need to push it in.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:33.171 --> 1:08:38.942]: 
  It gets put here and it can't go any further. The dick can still go further because it's attached to the foreskin like that.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:38.908 --> 1:08:41.946]: 
  You know it! So it's all in! You're an exception for this! YAYS! It's all yours!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:41.946 --> 1:08:48.948]: 
  I've had sex of many

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:44.528 --> 1:09:11.849]: 
  So you're saying the force kid stays out of the pussy, right? The force kid stays out of the vagina. No, I'm saying that- You're saying you're- you're saying you bunches up outside of the vagina and the dick goes in? Yes! Then it does- what decision do you have if it's pushed against the fucking thing? The whole thing is- It's not going in! It helps! You're just scrunching it up, I can do this right now! That's the point of it! So let me get this straight, I can pull my force kid over my dick and that's what you feel would give sex, it's no different! You don't have force kids! What are you talking about? Yeah, okay, okay, okay!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:08.895 --> 1:09:23.779]: 
  You don't have force. What are you talking about? Yeah, okay, okay, okay. You're dick would still go in without the force. Exactly. I'm going to sell this item in Ryder. You're dimmer. Zach, when you jack off, do you use lube? No, I've never used lube. So you get your dry hand and you fucking put on your dry fucking... Do you...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:13.249 --> 1:09:16.118]: 
  I'm going to sell this item right now.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:23.779 --> 1:09:28.437]: 
  Have you ever seen a cut dick before? I mean, a cut dick before? A cut dick. A cut dick.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:26.984 --> 1:09:49.227]: 
  Like most porn is American I watch porn. Nile, look, look at my dick. Ugh, you continue. But anyway. You could have wiped first. Porn-o. Anyways. Wipe my dick. Chris, Chris, one thing I have to talk to you about is you wipe your dick after you piss. I don't do that. I do. I squeeze it a little bit. Why do you wipe it? I squeeze, I squeeze, I wipe, then I shake.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:35.642 --> 1:09:35.929]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:37.785 --> 1:09:38.595]: 
  anyway

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:45.852 --> 1:09:47.319]: 
  I wonder, is there a way?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:49.345 --> 1:09:59.267]: 
  Nice foreskin, dumbass. Yeah, I'm not that careful. There's nothing to do with my foreskin. It- Oh, excuse me? What are you talking about? He said whatever he pees, it comes like a fucking shower. I pull my foreskin back when I do-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:55.994 --> 1:09:56.010]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:57.867 --> 1:10:07.452]: 
  I pull my foreskin back when I do it. Yeah, no, when I pee and I don't pull my foreskin back, it's okay. Guess what I do? No hands! No hands! It does not come out like a garden hose when you're fucking like, sneaky.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:04.482 --> 1:10:06.254]: 
  I not like her

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:07.452 --> 1:10:19.754]: 
  Look, it's Jack's done with my toes, and I pee! What? Listen! On his toes! Yeah, why would you pee on your toes? I have a big, big flop out, and I said no hands! It's something related at the beach.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:12.599 --> 1:10:13.493]: 
  Yeah, why would you...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:17.864 --> 1:10:23.500]: 
  It has its benefits for being cut, but it also has its benefits for not being cut.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:23.382 --> 1:10:30.452]: 
  Talk to the European they're so proud that their dick is not good You are the guy who used to call me a freak for being cut you brought all this on your

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:30.452 --> 1:10:40.088]:

  Look, I don't think you're... I don't think you're... It's free, Edgy. I don't think you're...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:41.067 --> 1:10:46.230]: 
  I don't think you're inferior for not being cut, but I think that on cut decks are superior than cut

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:46.230 --> 1:10:52.086]: 
  If I cut your voice right now and you had sex, you'd be like, wow, that's like 2% different. Yeah, 2%, 2%.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:52.086 --> 1:10:53.065]: 
  2 whole percent.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:53.065 --> 1:11:06.126]: 
  And guess what, guess what step right you like pee? We pour dicks out and we pee. Yeah. I don't have to like open locks and do algorithms. No, it's not an algorithm. I pull my dick back. You have to do a fucking rubies cube. No, but it feels good when you put a forcekin back.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:57.773 --> 1:10:59.849]: 
  Yeah, I don't have to open like that.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:02.616 --> 1:11:03.072]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:04.152 --> 1:11:08.505]: 
  Nobody feels good when you pull my foreskin back because I pull my foreskin back and go and then I pee.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:07.780 --> 1:11:12.758]: 
  And then if you have to pull it back at the locket place, you have to like put a bike block on it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:12.674 --> 1:11:37.075]: 
  You have to go and scramble with your dick and be like oh god pull the foreskin back off You don't have to but if you don't then it comes out like a it comes out like a fucking I went when I was five I saw like an elephant pee and it came out like a waterfall it comes out like that if you don't pull it back We're talking about foreskins for 15 minutes Well foreskins is a topic of concern like cuz I think people in the comments are gonna debate about the foreskins But like we're the minority because we're not American

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:37.075 --> 1:11:42.407]: 
  I think everybody goes to the opposite side because it's funnier. I think it's funny watching guys go to the poor skids.

  My dickhead has plenty of nerve endings. I'm not missing out. That's either of you. You're not missing out. Look, you're not missing out, but we just don't need to use Lou before butt sex. Basically. Yes, Lou! No, no.
