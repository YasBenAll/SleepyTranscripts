 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:58.238 --> 0:07:03.300]: 
  Do you? Oh, do all you guys have psychological problem where you like watching videos of

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:02.862 --> 0:07:33.962]: 
  I think it's partially vasticistic. It has to be yeah I actually torture yeah, I find a lot there's I guess it's I kind of I pick and choose like a cherry pick the cringe I can watch because there's certain ones I can't watch with like actual human interaction with another person who doesn't like the situation Like if somebody if a really cringy person goes up to somebody and then she's just like like get the fuck away from me Or he's like get away from me I feel for that person and but it's when it's just them in the room like doing something Vasticistic or cringy I can I get down with it

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:06.439 --> 0:07:08.312]: 
  It's a partially torture. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:33.962 --> 0:07:41.657]: 
  I read a definition of like, you know, the point of, like, what makes something cringe is you sort of empathize with the person in the video. Yeah, that was good.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:39.413 --> 0:07:40.999]: 
  in the video.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:39.936 --> 0:08:00.929]:

  I can't watch after you. I feel like that's a good idea.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:01.654 --> 0:08:08.674]: 
  I feel like that's like a defense mechanism. Like he needs a reassurance that he's not fucking up, so it's like he tells himself.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:08:08.809 --> 0:08:21.668]: 
  I don't remember who it was. It was either Zach or Jeff, but someone linked me the Minecraft cringe video where all the people, the little kids went out to the microphone and started asking questions. Oh, and then they just...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:58.952 --> 0:10:05.787]: 
  No, the uploads, no accident on animal video deaths. It's always somebody intentionally killing... Fuck, he's like, totally good.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:02.952 --> 0:10:07.440]: 
  Yeah, it's kind of like a fucking cycle with like a, yeah, pillage clippers or something, yeah. Yeah, fire.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:06.495 --> 0:10:09.044]: 
  or something like that. Fire or black taper.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:10:07.002 --> 0:10:13.380]: 
  or black tape or... This is a very dark hour. Yeah, this is generally how we started.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:09.887 --> 0:10:39.334]: 
  Yeah, this is generally how we started. What we were saying earlier before we recorded, we were talking about this isn't suit, you know, this is relevant maybe weeks ago, but you know, I think it's the wrong thing. It's all your fault, I think. But the fact that when people die, like when, you know, internet personalities die, you know, as much people rush to make a video of them crying. Oh my god. Talking about it with abs enabled. Right with abs enabled. Yeah. That's a dead game. Like, you know, if we all die, like if I crash my Jeep and we all die.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:19.793 --> 0:10:20.924]: 
  It's all rolled, I think.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:30.390 --> 0:10:32.095]: 
  Oh my god. Talk to him.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:33.006 --> 0:10:34.997]: 
  That's it. Yeah. That's a dead end.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:34.997 --> 0:10:36.280]: 
  And we're saying like who

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:40.144 --> 0:10:46.911]: 
  Wait, who would be the first to immediately upload a video maybe that we know and cry about? Cry about you and-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:44.970 --> 0:10:59.719]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:55.585 --> 0:10:56.783]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:59.331 --> 0:11:01.997]:

  O que é wraps?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:25.943 --> 0:11:35.798]:

  Somebody died like it wasn't recently obviously it was a while ago Jew Wario Right, yeah, I never saw this guy's videos and people of what's when he died like the internet One person this there's one person who made a video which was just

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:53.129 --> 0:11:55.390]: 
  You know it's just one person.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:59.609 --> 0:13:05.489]: 
  Like you can just kind of tell that like people kind of soak in the whole like thing Yeah, like that Joe guy made a video. Yeah, yeah, angry Joe. He made a video. Oh the Jew I'm so angry He died. Yeah, you could no no no no no he was he had crocodile tears and everything Yeah, he was screaming. He was acting it up Well, like he was starring in his own fucking like role in a movie But no he he like made the video and here's the thing I could understand because The critic or whatever like nostalgia critic made a video and he had a lot of shit to say cuz he did stuff with him He did tons of movies. Yeah, but the only thing Joe said he's like it was in the you know, I remember seeing him in a hotel room and Yeah, he bumped into him once and he was gonna do something you know what really happened And this was my personal opinion My personal opinion is after he died he realized the things he could have done with him And maybe that may have might have been where the sadness came from but I don't think so I'll do something like that If somebody dies your first instinct is it to grab a camera you're a piece of shit Yeah, probably was I did two bucks this video here's like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:03.540 --> 0:12:03.794]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:53.997 --> 0:12:57.186]: 
  something like that. I think he's a sociopath.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:01.945 --> 0:13:02.502]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:02.502 --> 0:13:02.805]:

  My hero is dead and everybody's like, you know, it's pretty fucked up.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:21.992 --> 0:13:36.201]: 
  Yeah, and it was pretty fucked up. How much? All the people, by the way, I checked your Oreo statistic the day before, the day he died. Yeah. It was like a thousand views. The day after that it was like ten thousand views.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:30.278 --> 0:13:30.497]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:34.210 --> 0:13:38.969]: 
  Would you like to cover exactly what this guy has done with his life before?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:37.804 --> 0:13:57.665]: 
  This guy, look, he wasn't like a piece of shit he would pay, but he was just like... All the comments on his videos were like, you're a faggot. That was the comments on his videos before he died. And the day after it was like, he's a hero. Did he review stuff? No, exactly. I'm not even sure what he did. No, he basically... He reviewed Japanese stuff. Anymore at WarioHead. I think he found bargains. Yeah, I'll pledge to people. Yeah, I'll pledge to people.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:39.559 --> 0:13:40.656]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:47.558 --> 0:13:48.435]: 
  He's a hero.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:48.435 --> 0:13:48.503]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:48.503 --> 0:14:03.842]: 
  stuff exactly exactly I'm not even sure what he did no he basically you Japanese like any more I think I think you have people on Twitter had like the warrior yeah yeah no no you're not bad at all

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:53.447 --> 0:13:53.498]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:59.624 --> 0:14:35.550]: 
  Yeah, yeah, I'm just trying to... No, no, you're not. He wasn't bad at all. No, no, he was harmless, but I knew nothing about him. I'm not gonna ham up something that I don't care about. This isn't about him. I'll say this, it wasn't like he wouldn't have hated him, but nobody gave a shit about him. That fucking soul killed him. You've never heard... You know what you're... You know what I remember thoroughly? I remember my group of friends just knocking at him, this 35-year-old being in a group of like the awesome friends or whatever, a part of the critics thing, knocking on him 24-7, and you know what's fucked up is one of them was actually like... I think he's probably gonna kill himself first.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:06.002 --> 0:14:07.032]: 
  I'm not there.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:07.994 --> 0:14:10.373]: 
  I don't care about this isn't about him.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:15.486 --> 0:14:17.579]: 
  You're a lawyer. You've never heard, you know what you're... Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:35.550 --> 0:14:43.971]: 
  clear we're not the answer they were not really so that's a lot of people but I'm just explaining exploiting his death

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:37.694 --> 0:14:41.980]: 
  We're just knocking on the people who are like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:43.701 --> 0:17:16.436]: 
  Like I said, if you put it, by the way, when he died, nobody's comment was like, Oh, he was such an intimate friend or whatever, it was always like, I saw him once or I never got to meet him. Because nobody gave a shit when he was alive. And I'd say it was Vore did whatever. Don't say it like that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're gonna get so shit. Let me, let me fucking put note that. Nobody cared about when he was alive. And I'd say it was Vore did. I'm saying, Everybody, everybody who pretended to give a shit, did not give a shit. It was fucking cooked up sympathy so people could draw the attention to themselves. So people would feel sorry for you. It's like when you're 10 years old and your grandmother, she never talked to you, dies. And you walk into school with your head low. And you say, What happened? Did you come with grandma died? It's like, Oh, I'm so sorry. That's what these people are fucking doing. You can have sympathy. You can feel sorry for the family. And you can be supportive in that way. But don't play up this fucking bullshit that you actually care about someone more than you do. Because that makes you look even more of an asshole when people can see the facade. Suicide is never fucking good. His circumstances weren't good. But my point is, if you look at his views, if you look at the comments on his video, he was not a popular guy. That's a fact. Everybody gave fucking crocodile tears when he died so they could turn these two to the cell if you could give them empathy. Oh, I'm so sorry for you. You lost somebody to care about. Especially fucking angry Joe. What would you do if he died and people just made videos of him laughing? What do you mean, more funny? Don't make me make cynical here. I mean, how it is. No, look, if you were an actual fan of that guy and he died and you were sad, sweet, you know, I'm really sorry if that's fucked up. Like when Ed Goldine, I think you, Chris, you and I had a right to be like, that's fucked up. You know, we knew the guy, we were in to be with him. I was sad. I didn't make a fucking video of that scary guy, like, peace, going... Oh, oh. You know what's funny about that? What? Not him dying, but I mean... Oh, obvious. When I made a video called The Story of Ed's World and it was making fun of him, like, and then he died. Then he could have been in a front way. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and then he died and then everyone under the comments was like, you fucking piece of shit. Yeah. He fucking died, you piece of shit. And I was like, yeah, he was my friend. So I think that's the distinction. If you care about somebody, like Rob Williams did have a fair share of, like, people faking it, but a lot of people did care about the guy, so that makes sense. You care about Robin the same sense that he was like, he was in your childhood. That's what it was. Ed's on your fucking video. That's what it was. Dad's was like, okay, I get white people. He was a big influential guy. Yeah, profiting off someone's death is like the worst thing you can do. And it's evident. Yeah. You do something like that. That's just like the most snyery thing you can do. I just feel like you went into the bathroom and stuck his finger down his throat, make his eyes get teary and he turned on the camera and was like, oh.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:56.965 --> 0:15:00.002]: 
  Don't say it like that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:01.470 --> 0:15:01.960]: 
  No, no.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:12.254 --> 0:15:13.452]: 
  It was fun.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:34.984 --> 0:15:37.026]: 
  Fucking bullshit that you actually

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:42.494 --> 0:15:43.962]: 
  suicide suicide suicide

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:44.822 --> 0:15:44.839]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [0:16:02.423 --> 0:16:03.132]: 
  Zeg

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:03.132 --> 0:16:04.566]: 
  What would you do if he died?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:05.950 --> 0:16:10.523]: 
  What would be more fun? I think we're being cynical here. This is just how it is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:24.327 --> 0:16:25.103]: 
 ί이이이이이이이이이이이이이이이이이 Enterprise

 SPEAKER_04 [0:16:24.479 --> 0:16:24.951]: 
  응.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:27.989 --> 0:16:29.457]: 
  You know what's funny about that?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:37.067 --> 0:16:39.278]: 
  and then you die. The front leg. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:56.322 --> 0:17:00.490]: 
  He was in your childhood. That's what it is. Don't let people add to your fucking video.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:03.679 --> 0:17:03.696]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:11.272 --> 0:17:11.526]: 
  this

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:16.436 --> 0:17:41.580]: 
  I just came up with an idea for a website. It's a website, right? It notifies you a celebrity died, right? But it doesn't tell you which one. And then all of the YouTubers can go to it and be like, oh, they got a notification. And then they can open it in real time as they're filming themselves. And they can cry. It's like a present. It's like a present. Like, oh my god, you know, Obama died. And they're like, woo!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:18.749 --> 0:17:19.154]: 
  for what's next.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:41.580 --> 0:18:08.125]: 
  That's like one of the, and then you'll have your first national Tumblr Twitter associated day. Like your special one day, special day that everyone will forget in no time. That's another thing that pisses me off. Like these, these fucking days that trend on Twitter, and I know it's gay, but like they trend and you're just like, really? This is a real holiday? This is a day that's showing up? Can I give my Zach's advice for the podcast? Wait one sec. It's really what he said though. Here you go.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:01.004 --> 0:18:02.539]: 
  See you guys for showing up. Woo-Woo.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:05.425 --> 0:18:06.117]: 
  one. Another one. Two. One. Two. One. One. Two. One. One. What. One. One. Two. One. Two. One. One. Four. One. disagreements. Against this, one more length. Now you're making a mistake. And the total results are so close that all thequeurs would shares the victory.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:06.117 --> 0:18:07.382]: 
  It's really what he said though.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:08.749 --> 0:18:50.312]: 
  Set your Twitter trends to a different country like Japanese. I don't see a fucking thing yet. It's beautiful. I log on and it's like, HOTSY AT THE ALBUM! I don't know what the fuck you're saying. It's so good. Are you serious? See, I used to get stressed out because you do that. I didn't do that. You just change. You click. It's right where the trends are. I've never done that. It's so good. I just see like, fucking like National Titty Day and Girl Wage Day or whatever. Yeah, I used to go to Twitter and be like, Pray for Salita. I go to like some 13 year old Justice Beaver fan. I don't feel like fuck. I know. I know. I know. But now I go to the Japanese things and I do Google Translate. It's like a fucking volcano exploded in Japan. Who gives a shit? I'm fine. I'm fine.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:16.849 --> 0:18:23.228]: 
  I see it through the elbow, like I don't know what the fuck you're saying, it's so good. Are you serious? Yeah, I used to get stressed out when I used to do that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:25.877 --> 0:18:28.560]: 
  I've never done that. It's so good. I just, I used to-

 SPEAKER_04 [0:18:32.357 --> 0:18:32.982]: 
  Yeah, I used to...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:38.399 --> 0:18:39.580]: 
  I know! I know!

 SPEAKER_04 [0:18:50.312 --> 0:18:57.012]: 
  Well, what are those said like death to America?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:52.692 --> 0:19:00.809]: 
  Why'd we tell him he'd fight because I wouldn't understand it? Those were gonna trade for a while. They could also say Zach's a piece of shit fuck you Zach and I wouldn't even know. No, you would to know that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:56.438 --> 0:18:57.366]: 
  That's a piece of shit.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:01.450 --> 0:19:05.770]: 
  Well, you know what I think? You just said with the fucking celebrity death notification. Yeah, that could be...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:03.492 --> 0:19:04.504]: 
  celebrity debt.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:03.998 --> 0:19:07.947]: 
  that notification that could potentially be a new YouTube update

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:05.449 --> 0:19:05.500]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:07.947 --> 0:19:16.452]: 
  YouTube could like update the biggest YouTubers and be like, so we're gonna do it quick. You hear that investors? There's a website.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:11.119 --> 0:19:12.402]: 
  and be like, somebody die, go.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:16.452 --> 0:19:18.730]: 
  idea don't steal it all right well

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:17.987 --> 0:19:24.164]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:24.974 --> 0:19:27.454]: 
  The devastating... Patrice O'Neill, when he died, it really bothered me.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:25.649 --> 0:19:26.425]: 
  there Restaurant

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:27.285 --> 0:19:33.462]: 
  Robin Williams a little bit. I mean a tiny bit just because you grow up with him. Yeah, that's insane.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:29.192 --> 0:19:29.226]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:31.487 --> 0:19:42.540]: 
  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. He was in your childhood movies. Everyone remembers him as the Aladdin. Specifically most people remember him as the... The Aladdin? A pretty sure... Gene, the Aladdin. Problem, William.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:41.072 --> 0:19:43.992]: 
  on the funding bill.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:43.992 --> 0:20:01.947]: 
  You know what I meant, but like people remember him as the genie Most people do remember him more for less for being the genie. I remember him more for like the missus doubt fire Like the classics like this is doubt fire

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:55.112 --> 0:19:56.344]: 
  Like the classics like this.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:58.116 --> 0:19:59.449]: 
  I love that movie.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:59.449 --> 0:20:08.376]: 
  I think it's something that really pissed me off when Robin Williams died. It was like, I don't know what trendy website, but I have a picture of Jeannie Huggy Meladon.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:08.123 --> 0:20:10.080]:

  When Incink broke up I cried and that was like a death. How old were you? It's like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:01.060 --> 0:21:01.634]: 
  How old were you?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:21:03.726 --> 0:21:04.992]: 
  to

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:04.992 --> 0:21:06.460]: 
  That's devastating.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:06.325 --> 0:21:46.065]: 
  She wept and her mom was like, the part she wept. What about you, Zach? But Tricia died when I really cried? Yeah. Maybe cry? Well, if you really want to know, do you want to know? No. Carl's gonna see you when he kills himself. I wept and started punching the wall. You just punched it? I drew the good guy, y'all! That's what I said. He's still alive. He's still making those funny YouTube videos. He's dead to me. Yeah, this good screw video is where there's a fucking Aeroxy crack at it. And he's like, hey, man, how's it going? And he has these shitty slow trills. You know what I'm saying? Anyways. Here's a question.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:43.264 --> 0:21:43.500]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:44.715 --> 0:21:57.659]: 
  There's a question. So then? Let's say like Kristen Zach at Corey 2. If any one of you died, would any of you put up a video like eulogizing the other? Like you don't have to be crying, but would you? Exactly.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:46.065 --> 0:21:46.251]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21 --> 0:22:07.632]: 
  If Zach died, I would make a video. Would you animate it? Okay, if any of you guys died, I would make a video. The thumbnail would be a girl showing her titties so I could get lots of money.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:00.342 --> 0:22:01.911]: 
  Okay, if

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:08.914 --> 0:22:15.951]: 
  I would be sad at the video. You'd be like, I'm really upset. I'm gonna miss him. You died.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:12.998 --> 0:22:31.881]: 
  I don't miss him. If you died, let's say you died on the sleepy cabin website or the subreddit or something. Everybody's like, all the kids are like, oh shit, Chris, Chris died or Zach died. What kind of cringe thing do you think they post that? You wish you could just come back from the dead and just delete? Like there's an old picture of him when he was 16.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:29.687 --> 0:22:36.707]: 
  There's no picture of him when he was 16, finally. What? They gave him anything with you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:34.665 --> 0:22:39.542]: 
  Something, I took a dab of something with you. They would dig up anything.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:37.365 --> 0:22:46.630]: 
  They would dig up anything. Yeah. Can any of the videos, any of the world, tell me. Anime videos? Just any of them. No, any of them. No, any of them.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:44.993 --> 0:22:49.566]: 
  No, any of them. But you just want to be wiped from history.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:48.790 --> 0:23:03.825]: 
  Yeah. You want me to bring out my... Love my braids be splattered going like her tears. I saw one package, and we go... Yeah. Jeff, you died. I don't want a video of me eating a crunchy pickle for five minutes. Yeah. And that video... Could you do that? Yeah. Video it had. It was called... Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff. Jeff.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:59.489 --> 0:23:00.771]: 
  Could you do that?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:05.513 --> 0:23:10.272]: 
  No, I don't even call it like, mutt ripped yet. They call it like, eating a pickle and then just the very end just like, ripped.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:09.394 --> 0:23:26.303]: 
  Do you Jeff died also? If Jeff died In the video I would also plug Carlos Minci's YouTube I would have

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:21.645 --> 0:23:24.953]: 
  I would have in it like 40 seconds.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:27.518 --> 0:23:56.594]: 
  Jeff specifically that I would I would play like all the tankmen parodies I would go to Hickman, Hokey you say You're free Jeff, you're free Steve I would have a photoshop like one of those photoshop where the heads are clearly forward I'd have it like bending backwards so your head's there and then another tankman I would have an agent walking, hey, you Jeff your head looking back look at the camera If Jeff died I'd talk about how good it is

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:33.458 --> 0:23:35.449]: 
  If you die.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:36.647 --> 0:23:37.744]:

  Oh, hello.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:23:54.754 --> 0:24:07.495]: 
  If Jeff died, I'd talk about how good his animation with the Pokemon team was. And I'd highlight some of the comments on there that talk about whoever made this, I hope they fucking died.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:59.901 --> 0:24:00.424]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:59.952 --> 0:24:00.947]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:05.655 --> 0:24:09.807]: 
  Fucking love comments on those kinds of videos. I'll keep my pussies up cancer. I'm there.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:07.495 --> 0:24:22.497]: 
  I could never make anything more polarizing than that video. It's like perfectly 50-50 across the board. Do you think the Pokemon one? I thought it was funny and people that hate my guns for it. The Pokemon one? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:22.497 --> 0:24:23.813]: 
  I thought it was hilarious.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:23.965 --> 0:24:29.652]: 
  Cause I don't watch Pokemon, I don't know shit about Pokemon. That's the best parody, so I'm like... You know what I realized, I realized like one of the...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:24.876 --> 0:24:41.937]: 
  I don't know shit about that's parody so like you know what I realized I realized like one of the best parodies like people who make parodies So the ones that don't know anything about it So they just like almost gonna make some bullshit and then it's like you look at it and then you look at it You realize well, it's actually somewhat close, but completely not. I want to be kind of relevant

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:41.937 --> 0:24:56.922]: 
  I mean I thought it would be... I was watching a lot of the ScarfVN learning channel at the time with all their f***ing shows So that's what it was based on. It wasn't based on making fun of a dead kid. Okay? It was. It wasn't based on making fun of kids with cancer and tumors.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:56.466 --> 0:25:11.586]: 
  You put... You specifically triggered a recent kid inside? Oh, fuck off, everybody. I was like, I finally have the will to live in one of the YouTube and type the cancerous on that video and it died. I think it's funny, it came like the first video through, isn't it? Because you have blood in your hands.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:07.637 --> 0:25:16.851]: 
  I feel like it's funny, it's like... It's like the first bit of interest. Because you have blood in your hand. This kid is at brain gym, he's so big he thinks like his neighbor's horse is a Pokemon. That's funny.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:16.851 --> 0:25:25.103]: 
  Yes. Okay. So that's humor, right? You know what's stuck? Nicky, what's stuck? Why don't you get a pineapple? Anyways. Yeah. I don't, I, why, why is that?

You're like bacon tonight. So you grab that, then you grab some soup. One cup of noodle soup. What was it? A cup of noodle soup? A cup of chicken noodle soup.

He was like, we're like bacon And then they were like, you guys had a hill. I never said that I was actually Laughing because the defense mechanism I have that most retards have they laugh a lot Like they go to a plan with their hybrid ventilating because they almost died. Have you ever watched Jackass like you ever It's a quick one. No, it's still the same sort. What's this the dude? He's like famous now Yeah, Johnny Knoxville. He's like one of the famous

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:08.130 --> 0:30:08.957]: 
  Anyways, cool.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:14.475 --> 0:30:17.344]:

  Right good, hit it. Did you cry, Chris?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:49.862 --> 0:31:45.229]: 
  I was like, I was sad. He was, but the dude fucking slammed his client. I know he was a wasted drug. Yeah, but I grew up watching Jackass and Rindon was my favorite. His dad was sad, but it's his fucking fault for putting these idiots. He's a lean, you're gonna kill it. But anyways, that doesn't matter. I was still sad. Anyways, like, unlike he, so he would do something that was really terrifying that he would be scared of. He would laugh, though. Yeah, like he laughs. Like if he's gonna get hit really hard, he starts like freaking out and laugh. And if he gets pelted by something, like when somebody drops something on his balls and stuff, he starts laughing. And if he's about to be attacked by a bully, he just starts laughing. And it's like, some people do that. Like I remember I used to jump with my friend on the trampoline and we would like punch each other and push each other off. And when we were about to fall off, we'd all like laugh because it's like a defense thing. I don't know. It's weird. There's probably like some reason for it, but so I would laugh when I was about to die. So back to the bacon. I see. Back to the bacon.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:30:51.263 --> 0:30:54.942]: 
  He was, but the dude fucking slammed his car in the toilet, he was a wasted drug.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:53.946 --> 0:30:55.735]: 
  But what? What is he supposed to do with his butt?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:30:59.430 --> 0:31:02.265]:

  Every time he tried to recover, he started to fall more and then you lost a shoe. That's when we're like, uh-oh. There's the fence. There's the spike. There's his head. The brain was going to be right on it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:58.949 --> 0:32:01.834]: 
  Every time every time you try to recover

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:08.635 --> 0:32:08.787]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:08.787 --> 0:32:10.727]: 
  There's the spy.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:11.841 --> 0:32:42.992]: 
  The brain was gonna be right on it. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But then he came to our house. He was like, you guys have any spraying stuff to spray the pan down? You didn't fight it, did you? No. He just fucking cooked the bacon dry. He didn't have any. I was gonna use butter. And some other... You don't have anything. You don't have any condiments. You're gonna use fucking mustard. You filled up the house with smoke and everyone started coughing. We almost died, remember? Remember? He doesn't have any cigarettes. He does.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:30.285 --> 0:32:32.850]: 
  You don't have to do this, you don't have these condiments.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:43.752 --> 0:33:06.769]: 
  First of all, I was drunk. Second of all, I made the bacon. Second of all, first of all, you shared it and that was nice. Yeah, I had a few bacon strips. But the problem is like it's like a small kitchen in a room. So it's like the smoke is going to build up. I didn't know to open the window because I didn't. I was the window where it was right next to you. I was drunk. Have you played the fucking Sims? Cory, if you put it so in a closed space and let it finally die, you get it?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:50.097 --> 0:32:50.519]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:09.840 --> 0:33:37.515]: 
  When you first cook for the first time, because I do play the Sims, and you don't put an alarm, you're always supposed to put a fire alarm, the first time they cook they will always tell you. Corey, did you know in the Sims you can do the cheat where you make a firework, go up in the air, and the second it hits there, you pause the game, you pick up the explosion with the cheat, and you put it on your Sim, and you kill them. I used to just make houses and put a bunch of Sims in a corner, and put furniture there, and catch one fire. Oh, not even! Yeah, and just pee themselves until the fire eventually got to their side. I don't question Corey.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:26.800 --> 0:33:27.880]: 
  Yeah, you killed him.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:36.486 --> 0:33:46.611]: 
  I have a question for Corey. I'll come back to the drum thing in a minute. Why don't you cover your Civilization 5 story? Yes, this is for you. Can I see K-Town?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:43.489 --> 0:35:03.038]: 
  Yes, this is funny. Can I say hi? Can I say hi introducing Corey to take it away? Go ahead. We went to New York, as we said in the last part, a couple of podcasts to go, whatever fucking episode this is going to be, but personally I went to New York with Corey and I went there too, to John's house, and I was trying to get all these guys into Simphons to kind of play it, you know, play it. It's a fun little game, and you can make a religion to the game. And Corey had a lot of culture and religious points. Corey, explain what you fucking did to you, Hogan. So I like go-graded all the religious points, and I took the opportunity to make the religion of autism. Japanese autism, though. Yeah, it's Japanese autism, so you know it's bad. And John was busy making his own, like, he was like... He was putting a fucking bind in the middle of the desert. Yeah, he was in the fucking Persian desert making gold mines and stuff. Zach was out actually playing the game and making the landmarks and making America, and I was busy spreading autism, and it hit John. Because I went offline because I was having problems with Simphons, and I'm just like, I can't deal with this shit. So I went offline, and the AI took over, and the AI had lost its fucking mind. It just went straight to John. You were fucking haywire to do it. And it got like the cavalry, and just went straight to him and gave him autism. Dude, all John's cities about autism. John freaked out and tried to like, he sailed like halfway across the new world, and sent him with a little tiny island completely isolated. And like, within one turn it caught autism.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:16.007 --> 0:34:19.821]: 
  Japanese artists are the best.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:23.853 --> 0:34:26.284]: 
  He was like, he was fucking buying it in the building.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:47.040 --> 0:34:48.762]: 
  straight to John.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:53.504 --> 0:34:55.123]: 
  HHHHHU

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:04.084 --> 0:37:02.429]: 
  And I made the religion of American vaccinations to combat the autism. But the Japanese autism overwhelmed me. I couldn't deal with it. Ultimately leading to Zack and John having a big war battle. But you can't with Japanese. And then nothing, just everyone dies, everything exploded. Didn't you make another religion after that? Was there something? Yeah, the other one, I made another game and I called it Down syndrome this time. The difference was, it wasn't so much that I was spreading it, is that I was getting people left and right calling me up, being like, hey, give me some of that Down syndrome. No, give me the Down syndrome. All Asians look at Down syndrome, dude. Napoleon's calling me up and he's constantly asking me. You know, the French were looking at him so constantly, dude, we see the Down syndrome for tasteies. Yeah, no, he was like, all the people want a Russian look at Down syndrome. That skinny motherfucker was asking me for salt and Down syndrome the whole time. And eventually I was like, no motherfucker. And I got, who's the emperor, the Egyptian guy? Oh, Ramsey? Yeah, I got me and Ramsey's teams up and we fucking killed his ass. And then Ramsey's was asking me for citrus and Down syndrome. And I'm like, not you too, motherfucker. But then all these other people were found and they were like, hey, you have Down syndrome? And eventually it started spreading. Why do they want the religion? People are like, dude, I heard you guys have some of that. Is that right? Yeah, that's true. Why do you think the numbers are right? Why do people in the game want the religion? Because if you have a really powerful religion, it starts affecting their places. And you can make little priests and stuff. Religion also helps. Culture does too. It benefits. People want to give a really powerful culture or religion. So I was like, I was like the big caravan of Down syndrome. So if his autism was small in number, no one wanted it? No, my vaccinations would have had numbers. His autism, people would have chosen my vaccinations. Nobody wanted it. It's too late, Zach. It's too little too late for the vaccinations in his autism. Goodness. See, that's why Sib 5 is a fun game. It is a fun game.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:18.276 --> 0:35:19.457]: 
  and nothing is ever going to happen.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:21.752 --> 0:35:22.731]: 
  Didn't you make another religious...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:22.731 --> 0:35:23.001]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:23.001 --> 0:35:23.119]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:24.216 --> 0:35:25.650]: 
  Yeah, the other one I...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:35:38.492 --> 0:35:39.437]: 
  You're dead, too.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:39.437 --> 0:35:44.213]: 
  The Poli is what the devil's supposed to do. The Poli is the color we have because it's constantly acid.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:45.968 --> 0:35:48.449]:

  Both are

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:56.869 --> 0:35:57.207]: 
  He mentioned it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:03.400 --> 0:36:06.944]: 
  Yeah, I got me and Ramsay's teeth out and we fucking killed his ass.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:14.132 --> 0:36:14.487]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:18.908 --> 0:36:20.410]: 
  Why do they want to resist?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:21.490 --> 0:36:24.494]: 
  Dude, is that right? That's true. Dude, is that right?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:24.494 --> 0:36:24.882]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:33.184 --> 0:36:37.470]:

Because you know the world will be full of success because of theしてSD write-link will have been developed and at some point you may expect such�� some kind of sightseeing apps for different products from various vendors and different things… not to mention, we really like how you have a good opportunity to write your fiancee and you are actually kind of in that role. Now we will be back.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:38.871 --> 0:36:39.006]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:39.006 --> 0:36:40.457]: 
  Okay, so I was like the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:44.322 --> 0:36:46.465]: 
  He was the hottest judge in the world.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:49.502 --> 0:36:49.519]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:54.784 --> 0:36:55.814]: 
  Nobody wanted anything.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:03.509 --> 0:37:57.677]: 
  It's only fun because you made it autistic and dancing. Exactly! That's what you do! I'm kidding, I know it's fun. It's one of those few games that I can actually play for like hours on end. You have kids like... There was this dude, in one game, there was this one Indian guy who was asking me for like 16 resources and I'm like, dude, fuck you. What was he got, dude? I don't know, he was asking me for like cotton, he was asking me for the foxes, he was asking me for like my stone, my iron, and I'm like, dude, I know you're like dying and like the ant arctic, but I'm not giving you any fucking stuff. I don't wrap this up because I don't want people to probably don't get a share of this game, but it's a fucking game because you can like... You think like a fucking maniac, like one guy who was, it was like, uh... It was the fucking Dutch who were making, we were like developing it on nukes and I had my own, I was like, you can't fucking do it. I nuked him out of like some of the pens. You said you did. I nuked him out, I was like, yeah, I was like, fuck, you can't get nukes, you can't get nukes, you can't put some nukes, fuck you. Yeah, like, you upgraded your thing, you had nukes and they still had like cavemen and sticks and all that stuff.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:05.010 --> 0:37:06.495]: 
  They can dance in these. Exactly!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:06.495 --> 0:37:08.369]: 
  How it does means what? They're both there.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:09.482 --> 0:37:11.170]: 
  I know it's fun.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:13.380 --> 0:37:14.055]: 
  It's really stupid

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:18.983 --> 0:37:20.265]: 
 ?!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:26.290 --> 0:37:27.454]: 
  and I'm like, dude, I know you're gonna get it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:30.205 --> 0:37:31.909]: 
  I'm not giving you any fucking stuff.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:58.521 --> 0:38:33.773]: 
  All he was doing was developing a peaceful nuclear program. He was like, fuck you dude. He can't get them to. He's like, why do you hypothetically want to shoot me with them? It's like, that's another thing too. Like if people, if they're like building better things, like they're building pyramids and they're building like- You're like fucking these guys. They're advancing too, because you fucking learn self-destruct and blow them up before they can do anything. Just like real world. Anyways. Where the time? So that was fun. We have a special guest. We should be having her more or less. Do you have any funny drunk stories? Because apparently I guess I was the-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:14.974 --> 0:38:15.447]: 
  Thank you for watching.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:34.380 --> 0:38:35.444]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:38:35.444 --> 0:38:37.587]: 
  Oh, did we even finish that?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:37.587 --> 0:39:02.730]: 
  We were up there, yeah basically Corey got drunk. I burned down the house and here we are in house 2. And he fucking screwed the school bureau. It was the audio of Corey burning down the house with the A- Oh yeah! Yeah, pull it out. People thought like I- It suited here. People thought I would apparently like wipe my ass for the first time, which is very funny by the way. What actually happened was I spilled beer all over myself and the joke was, look at me, I peed my pants. But I guess nobody noticed that because I had toilet paper down there.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:42.160 --> 0:38:44.725]: 
  Get your fucking spirit, peaceful girl.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:45.855 --> 0:38:46.868]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:13.244 --> 0:39:31.536]: 
  Did we... Okay, so if we're talking drunk stories, have we all talked about the drunkest we've ever been? Oh, we do. Nikki, would you go? No, have we? I think a little bit. I would do it, yeah, because I talked about... We definitely talked about it. Talk about your worst, like, drunk... Like, your best drunk experience. Have you ever had, like, a really weird drunk experience?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:20.213 --> 0:39:20.297]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:20.348 --> 0:39:21.681]: 
  I guess I've ever been.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:39:31.671 --> 0:39:58.249]: 
  Uh, yes. When I was under 21, I was at a house party with two friends who were very drunk and on a lot of drugs. And then we went, we didn't have a lot of money, so we paid for a taxi and went to a bus terminal. We missed the last bus leaving the terminal. We decided to walk to my house because we were under 21.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:57.557 --> 0:39:58.452]: 
 ']

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:57.996 --> 0:39:59.549]: 
  Why was it? For me, yes.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:39:58.840 --> 0:40:02.164]: 
  It was a four hour walk.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:01.641 --> 0:40:05.269]: 
  You're all drug-y out of drugs. No, I'm losing it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:40:04.257 --> 0:40:08.070]: 
  No, I was the only drunk one. I was the only drunk.

 isch

 SPEAKER_04 [0:40:09.117 --> 0:40:13.572]: 
  Yeah, we didn't want to call anyone because we were under 21. We didn't want to get in trouble. You could.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:13.150 --> 0:40:16.660]: 
  You could have like... What kind of drugs were there? Were they like red bull or something?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:40:16.677 --> 0:40:22.296]: 
  I think it was like cocaine and ecstasy or something. Oh, sweet, sweet, sweet. Pretty hardcore drugs.

  Woah! Do you still like it?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:40:38.952 --> 0:41:00.602]: 
  Yeah, we walked to my house from the bus terminal and I lost my shoes at a graveyard because we decided it was a good idea to cut through and I stubbed my toe and was black and bleeding and I walked barefoot for about three, four hours along the highway full of casinos and hookers and all these like weird guys looking at us.

And then I get this drink. Holy, they would kill you more in Brody if they tried fucking doggy piss at my order. Try to imagine that your piss isn't there. Let me, let me like, throw that at the movie. What do you say? It'd be like the last five minutes of room where you're like, smoke service.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:51.974 --> 0:55:55.095]: 
  You're trying to... Let me let me like a through the edge of the movie.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:59.230 --> 0:56:06.368]: 
  I feel like wow you are uh... I don't know, yeah what could I do worse than just behead you in the town square?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:05.490 --> 0:56:14.417]: 
  What would you say when you tasted it? What would you say? I'd not. You're like, this is the foulest shit I've eaten. There you go. Say it, say it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:12.932 --> 0:56:13.455]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:14.417 --> 0:56:24.171]: 
  This is the uh... I like your chin. I can't act like a god damn... You're asking me to roleplay as a king who just drank meal piss or whatever. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:16.510 --> 0:56:20.273]: 
  I like your- I can't actually get god damn- You're asking me to roll-

 SPEAKER_04 [0:56:23.699 --> 0:56:28.694]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:25.538 --> 0:56:34.650]: 
  This is bad coffee.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:28.694 --> 0:56:29.504]: 
  This is all a mess.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:29.504 --> 0:56:32.136]: 
  Oh, Al clock!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:34.144 --> 0:56:51.390]: 
  Yeah. Yes, but isn't there a bit of a punch in it? You're not used to it. You're used to drinking old gray water, but you haven't tried my mule piss coffee, sir. This is new. I'm telling you, it'll catch on. People will drink it, they'll hit this. The taste will be stuck in their mouth forever, but it'll keep on waiting.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:50.412 --> 0:56:55.997]: 
  Maybe an off-your-job is the court jester back here close down your coffee shop. You can do the court

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:55.997 --> 0:56:58.140]: 
  The coffee is good, but we should still kill him.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:59.220 --> 0:57:31.283]: 
  Why is he fucking like a weirdo-like, spiel character? What's that guy's big ego on? Oh! He must be! Oh, um, yeah, that was too much! Let's see if I can- Kyle, let's logic- about it, when you're like, try this muppet's coffee, but it's not coffee, it's just muppet. There's nothing coffee about it. There's mud and muppet and little chunks of plague rat. Yeah, but it's like, it's an early form of coffee. Nobody knows what coffee is yet. What's coffee, brother? It's just muppet! Wouldn't you want to play this opportunity to get coffee, Glory? Why don't you just go get some coffee beans? Yeah, but it's a rock hamburger.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:07.995 --> 0:57:10.493]: 
  I love you, man. I love you, bye.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:08.333 --> 0:57:09.447]: 
  I'm sorry.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:57:10.139 --> 0:57:10.442]: 
  like

 SPEAKER_04 [0:57:20.500 --> 0:57:21.394]: 
  What the hell was co-

 SPEAKER_04 [0:57:22.305 --> 0:57:27.554]: 
  When you want to take this opportunity to event coffee, Laurie? Why don't you just go get some coffee beans?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:30.321 --> 0:57:33.949]: 
  Why don't you roast your own coffee beans? Cory, if you got something to tell me...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:32.110 --> 0:57:44.007]: 
  Cory, if you got set back to time, you would find an old abandoned bar and you would sit in the mud drying porn until you died of plague. That's true. So we would take pictures of it with my Polaroid and give it to you. Cory would be in the cage.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:57:43.011 --> 0:57:48.580]: 
  Cor would be in a cave drawing titties and little nicks. People would walk and go and fight and would just kill you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:46.200 --> 0:58:28.894]: 
  I would invite people to do this, but I'll kill you. First it's like, please don't make fun of it, it's my first time. What about the real guys back then, you should just draw the report and beat up in their house and like, crumple up and throw it away? Always thought the funniest part of that Monty Python movie wasn't the jokes, it was just the fact all the peasants sit around in muds throwing mud into piles of mud. That's the funniest part of the movie, yeah. Alright, had they talked again? They just talked like nice British people. No, there's no way to do that, he was like, talking to a fucking weirdo. So, might, so... He had a bitch voice, he can't... So, would I be beheaded afterwards, the co-coffee thing? Yeah, and then they pour the mule piss down your neck hole and hang you up on the fucking cross, outside the village to warn other people. They like, boil the mule piss to a fucking scolding temperature before you're done with it, bro. They can peel your head and call you the mule piss peasant retoad.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:55.650 --> 0:57:55.667]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:55.667 --> 0:57:55.735]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:58:01.860 --> 0:58:04.257]: 
  This is the first part of the movie yet.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:11.125 --> 0:58:13.757]: 
  So would I be beheaded?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:15.445 --> 0:58:16.019]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:03.049 --> 0:59:06.829]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:07.099 --> 0:59:08.567]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:08.550 --> 0:59:09.630]:

  Uh, I dropped out. You know what?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:11.639 --> 0:59:15.064]: 
  You know how to dropouts? Oh no, I stayed in high school. Sorry, I dropped out of college.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:11.689 --> 0:59:12.921]: 
  We know what it's about.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:15.064 --> 0:59:28.767]: 
  Yeah, no, I left high school sophomore year because I thought it was bullshit. It is. You dropped it at high school? Yep. School was bullshit. No! I would have rather stayed home and worked on art than... Smoked dank weed. Yeah. I wanted to smoke the dank weed. You're permanent.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:19.097 --> 0:59:22.135]: 
  You dropped it at high school? Yeah. It was bullshit. No!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:25.004 --> 0:59:26.691]: 
  Smoke the deck, we just made it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:28.176 --> 0:59:32.715]: 
  Your parents sound cool. My parents would have to beheaded me if I did that. So, our college.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:33.120 --> 0:59:35.989]: 
  Our college is not necessary.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:36.124 --> 0:59:43.634]: 
  No, I never thought it was. And I feel like I ask that all the time. Do you have the experience of pretentious fucks, as they say in our college? Did you have that experience?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:36.985 --> 0:59:38.740]: 
  it was. And I pillow ass it all the time.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:44.882 --> 0:59:54.957]: 
  You know, I went to community college and I took some life drawing classes and that's all I needed. I realized afterwards, like, it's just a waste of money. No, no, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:53.624 --> 0:59:59.834]: 
  No, no, yeah, yeah. Do you have to get like your GED or something from high school before you can go to college? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:58.669 --> 1:00:07.191]: 
  Yeah, um, the one I want to yes, but I don't think it's necessary all the time. I don't know what the rules are now

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:06.111 --> 1:00:07.343]: 
  How did you get in there?

 SPEAKER_04 [1:00:07.815 --> 1:00:11.460]: 
  I showed him my titties. Oh, my titties. Oh, those are big.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:09.317 --> 1:00:10.262]: 
  It makes sense.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:11.460 --> 1:00:15.882]: 
  You really about it now? Yes! You can't check below. Look like your titties below! But I don't think...

 SPEAKER_04 [1:00:13.789 --> 1:00:17.485]: 
  Look like your titties below. I don't think our college is necessary.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:17.485 --> 1:00:27.374]: 
  No, because it's one of those things like I've never learned. I never went to art school. When I went to art and class it was just my teacher taught like be littleing me and saying I'll never make anything.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:00:27.137 --> 1:00:31.204]: 
  Did you ever like draw on there like oh that's anime it's like yeah, yeah, no

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:30.175 --> 1:00:59.250]: 
  Yeah, yeah, no, can I can I see this a little bit controversial, but I feel like I feel like cartoons are harder to draw Good good cartoon style is harder to do. They're realistic realism because I feel like anybody With enough practice can really get like life drawing down is that is that too far to say no anybody with dedication can do that But then to then take real life and caricature eyes it simplify it Peely way

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:52.821 --> 1:00:53.952]: 
  Because, top det менее, I typed...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:53.952 --> 1:00:55.994]: 
  It's like it's high from here to say no

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:55.994 --> 1:01:02.052]: 
  It's a very unique set of rules that you have to follow.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:00.786 --> 1:01:09.510]: 
  Yeah, yeah, me and Zach were saying that if you like spent your life become the world's greatest photo realism drawer No one would even care in the end because there's nothing unique about it

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:09.510 --> 1:01:22.892]: 
  That's what always gets all the attention on the internet. Like, oh look what I did. I traced and copied it. I'm going to give you a human photo copy or copy the photo. It takes a huge amount of skill, but no one will really care in the end.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:13.392 --> 1:01:13.999]: 
  Oh, look what I did.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:16.615 --> 1:01:20.327]: 
  You're dealing patters with gra Bong so that is like a serious

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:21.981 --> 1:04:13.566]: 
  I would honestly say there's only five art styles that I really like that I like artists to art styles wrong But that's a good art style. Maybe five maybe six tops But it's first like but you know, so I think it's hard to calculate stuff and simplify the way that's really appealing and aesthetically You know, it's nice. It's good. I'm just like yeah, but I feel like cuz that's just me though No, when I do it I do art and I'm doing like proportional stuff and I'm like that I'm like I don't want to do it exactly on model with a reference So I try to like cartoonify it so I have like this weird hybrid cartoon style because I because it's like Like I was saying like proportional stuff like when you see a picture of a certain angle Sometimes it just looks weird because you're not even though it's accurate Like if somebody's looking back and their head looks six times bigger than their fucking body You're just like that looks retarded so when people draw that same exact thing they'll make the head smaller because then realistically that's what you would think it would look like and Normal people would do that if they're doing like the sort of like Realistic thing they would do the big head thing, but I just feel Aesthetically it looks more appealing when you try it when you like exaggerate more and do more interesting stuff So cartoons are just like exaggerating feature I mean, I think it's safe to say that I've seen way more art styles that are cartoon world. Go that's fucking disgusting To my taste obviously that looks nasty Like you know, you want to pee yes, seriously there may be like three or four TV shows or like that's a nice own style So it's way easier to fuck up a cartoon style that is to because if you do a realism drawing and you kind of make a little walk It's like oh, that's pretty good. It's really hard to Royally fuck up a realism style Again, that's just me though, but it's really easy to have a really unappealing a severely unappealing Contour style. It's like oh, they made that they made these editorly facial details or they made the hands to me for something Details Bad and so to find a good balance of simple yet yet, you know, it shows what's going on It's hard. Yes, we're having like little things can really change like my my dad started drawing recently I used to stop now because he gave up But what he was like he was getting really at the drawing like portraits because he's watching this TV show That was like the X factor of portrait drawing my dad was like, yeah I'm gonna be a portrait drawer and you start sending pictures of like my sister or my teeth He put the lines in between each tooth so it looks like fucking creepy old lady and shit That was realism so it's still look when you saw it still wasn't like Proposals, that's not that but even in realism if you put like big black lines between each to you look like a fucking like You weren't like it's hard to like you know you've got it wasn't a very great drawing you're so like that still looks alright Yeah, no, no, but it's my point. It's way easier So makes me look like bad yeah with a cartoon so that looks bad They had to be like it's like any cartoon he had with the real thing here. So that's disgusting dad if you're listening I thought your pictures were great. You shouldn't have given up

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:10.859 --> 1:03:13.744]: 
  or they put specific details in the inspection lead.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:20.190 --> 1:03:20.460]: 
  He is.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:22.553 --> 1:03:23.295]: 
  estem

 SPEAKER_04 [1:03:41.453 --> 1:03:42.938]: 
  I want you to understand.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:42.938 --> 1:03:44.541]: 
  realism though so it's still low for you to

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:47.511 --> 1:03:47.950]: 
  But you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:59.577 --> 1:03:59.661]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [1:03:59.678 --> 1:04:00.944]: 
  Yeah, no, no, but it's- That's my point, it's-

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:13.667 --> 1:04:31.420]: 
  I feel bad for people who are super talented at making a traditional lifelike drawing and they're just, you know, they can capture your face but there's just no, there's nothing for them who can't pretend but like just with tech, technology, like someone who's really good at charcoal like they can't make a living I don't think

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:21.261 --> 1:04:21.599]: 
  Bon appetit!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:23.370 --> 1:04:24.653]: 
  they're playing this game.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:28.838 --> 1:04:28.872]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:31.420 --> 1:04:38.912]: 
  No. You also have to adapt too. So if you're not good at this, well then try to branch off to the closest thing that will get you a living.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:38.912 --> 1:04:47.451]: 
  It's weird too when people post something like that All the comments are like, you're so good You can make a living at this, like Do we what those again?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:44.751 --> 1:05:22.079]: 
  doing what though? I can draw a chair and make a quick a chair. It's like cool but I can take Photoshop and add a fucking sketch filter to it. Yeah yeah. By the way we're not fucking dissing you whole bros who can draw stuff good like but it takes a lot of talent, it takes a lot of skill but we're saying I'm especially so I'm not speaking for everybody but I think I think being able to draw a good appealing cartoon style is way underappreciated in comparison to drawing a really realistic style. No I agree.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:49.155 --> 1:04:49.763]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:50.674 --> 1:04:52.176]: 
  Yeah, it's like I can't take food.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:50.961 --> 1:04:50.995]:

What is your policy on Israel? Do you believe in the two-state solution? We gotta get more foot jobs, more foot job focused stuff there. Sir, what is your policy on the two-state solution? Do you support that or opposed to that? If they can only show their ankles, we gotta pass a lot of, at least, be able to show half their face.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:29.916 --> 1:06:31.350]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:59.160 --> 1:07:21.790]: 
  Mr. President, your adversary has said multiple times that you have caused $42 billion in debt for four years. How is that possible? What are the other ways you're going to? I spent some of that stuff I needed at the time. Like what? Part of them stuff.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:25.283 --> 1:07:25.317]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:40.015 --> 1:07:52.857]: 
  Sir, I'd like to point out, I think, Tan, on his question, sea levels are present 10 feet. Most of the floor is under water. Hold on. President Corey, how do you explain the shortage of Pokemon cars aside of the hedgehog figures? Wait, wait, wait, wait, look. Sir.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:44.841 --> 1:07:45.449]:

  Go on, check it out.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:18:41.785 --> 1:19:03.199]: 
  Mickey, talk about establishing yourself as an artist. Alright, recently I left my office job after two years and I did a lot of stupid paperwork there and now I'm trying to do art full time which I'm not really sure what that means but so far I've only done commissions and I don't like doing commissions. You're a staff. So I'm trying to figure out how to establish yourself as an artist.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:03.300 --> 1:19:23.365]: 
  What I first did when I started out, because like getting noticed and stuff, first of all, you're already established. People know your art. They think you're very good at what you do and people know and they see it. So you're not really in the area where people are still like, hey, look at me, you're out of that. But I guess establishing it now is kind of like making it fun.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:19:22.555 --> 1:19:27.398]: 
  Like how can I make enough money where I am?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:27.398 --> 1:20:33.700]: 
  I would say this like the first the hardest part is what you've already done the hardest part Let's use it our plans and analogy the hardest part is taking off once you get there. You're good You just need to stabilize it with them. Yeah, you're basically you've already established your brand of you pre-war I would just say here's what I'm holding like to come on what you're saying because that's a good analogy Here's where you basically are you're at that point where they're telling you you can turn on your cell phones and computers now That's where you are So you're at the top point where the flies just started now you can start doing shit You can fuck around now you can fuck some I would just say always be aware of This is a big problem with artists because artists are terrible business people terrible. I would just say Be conscious of what is going on and what's gonna keep you afloat But that also you want to do like a lot of people I'm joining examples a lot of people will refuse to Be consistent be consistent This shitty podcast everyone hates we should all kill ourselves I'm gonna buy a gun to kill myself in the mouth with a gun both can hit my brain kill me but do soft

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:38.181 --> 1:19:39.244]: 
  Yeah, you're basically-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:42.248 --> 1:19:43.159]: 
  I would just say here's what

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:52.508 --> 1:19:52.947]: 
  So you're

 SPEAKER_04 [1:19:57.638 --> 1:19:58.448]: 
  I would get

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:58.448 --> 1:19:59.427]: 
  I would say all

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:06.092 --> 1:20:06.109]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:24.435 --> 1:20:24.773]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:20:30.527 --> 1:20:43.150]: 
  Wait, wait, wait, wait, before that, I think it'd be really funny. What are those contractions called, where it's like you set one thing off and it's like... Jeff, also there's a lot of types. Jeff Suicide. Yeah, go for it. That would be very funny. That's Jeff Suicide. The root goldberry.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:37.497 --> 1:20:45.934]: 
  I thought this was a lot of times. Jeff Suicide. Yeah, Goldberg we should go. That would be very funny. That's Jeff Suicide. That's the Root Goldberg, isn't it? Is that what it's called? What? The Root Goldberg?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:45.934 --> 1:20:49.512]: 
  I think... That's what they named the guy that invented it, I guess.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:48.870 --> 1:21:37.302]: 
  But anyways, my point is, we release this podcast every Friday. I would say that's the first step is being consistent. Then I would start to branch out once you have consistency. Once you start getting money from doing the thing consistently, start finding other ways of becoming it. Use that income to start branching out. Hell, where you can. I think that's important. So just branch out and don't stay stagnant. Don't just plateau. Yeah, expand. If you plateau, you're gonna stay plateau. You might even lose some money. Yeah. For instance, I used to, back in the day, specifically use YouTube only. And YouTube in new grounds, I use nothing else. And only recently, maybe like a few years ago, I've gotten in Twitter and Facebook and Tumblr. And I use all that stuff to expand my art. And it helps because it gets more people. Because some people don't use Twitter a lot. Some people use only Twitter and don't use Facebook.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:10.302 --> 1:21:10.437]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:21:10.437 --> 1:21:10.977]: 
  If you'd like to

 SPEAKER_03 [1:21:13.525 --> 1:21:13.879]: 
  Here.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:21:36.930 --> 1:21:42.752]: 
  So how would I use YouTube if I just draw like I don't I know animal

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:39.951 --> 1:23:17.370]: 
  I don't I don't animal for you. I think it's an example. I would say whatever find the equivalent though. It's so basically Look what you could do and then grab that look look over here could do if you expand it So you think of what you would do if you're going to expand Yeah, for instance if you did an art thing you did a big art thing people sometimes want to see the process of that like Shad uploads speed arts all the time when he gets a chance and people like seeing that you upload that to YouTube And you can put the art stuff on your like site You want to do and then if you had a consistent art because you were very fun like cartoon style and you could have a site where you Have people do comics and stuff and stay consistent and then people could look up specifically stuff from you You could do stuff on your Twitter and just interact also I'd like to point out to a shed shed man. Yeah a good friend of the podcast you Mm-hmm. Whoa you fuck off I'm sure But what he'll do is he'll Probably you do put speedpates. Yeah, that's him drawing and do a tie-lapse through Yeah, so there's a lot of ways you can do I would say don't don't think it's like the box thing of it What ways can I expand? How do I get to those goals and how do I keep from fucking imploding myself? Cuz once I say if you get to me if you crawl out of the swamp and you fucking stabilize in the air You gotta keep going you have to keep getting momentum. You can't just stag late That's the most important thing I would say is establish yourself, but We can I think we could all talk about to even the first step of how you establish yourself a lot of people can't make it that far That's that's hard for a lot of people too. Yeah, I guess Yeah, I also kind of establishing yourself is doing that thing that's

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:52.439 --> 1:21:52.523]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:30.188 --> 1:22:34.440]: 
  А теперь я к Блешке не 어떡аюсь

 SPEAKER_03 [1:22:34.440 --> 1:22:34.457]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:18.012 --> 1:24:40.159]: 
  Kind of doing something that makes you stick out. Yeah. Like, not even, I would say be original. Be original. No, no, yeah, yeah. Because like, Shad, Shad does lots of, Shad does art of all categories. He does, he doesn't have like, cause, and I'm kind of the same way. I don't like the idea of doing boring art, like porn and stuff, anyone else can see. Anyone can see a girl fucking a guy. Anyone can see a girl with a big old titties hanging up. Anyone can see a dude sitting there with a thick hanging out. But then there's specific things people want to see that nobody sees. And it's like, I want to do that. I want to make the stuff that nobody sees, but wants to see. And you know there's people out there who like that stuff, but don't want to say it. So you do that, and that establishes you as like, oh, he's not, he does this stuff. And then that kind of explains, but that's more important. I would just say, as far as establishing yourself, I wouldn't, because that's a broad thing. If you're a cartoonist or an amateur or a musician, do whatever makes you unique. I would say don't try to be unique, just be yourself as gay as that sounds. Not to fucking Mr. Rogers it up here, but just be, just do what you want to do. Don't think, oh, my crap, parents are resolved, do those for now. Don't do that. Yeah, don't do stuff that's like- If you want to do parenties, you get a little bit of a bigger audience to start off, that's fine, but parenty stuff you like.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:32.768 --> 1:24:33.764]: 
  there don't you stop the

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:40.868 --> 1:25:53.025]: 
  Yeah, no, yeah. So don't jump on the fucking flappy bird because it's the hottest sleep of this week. If you're gonna pair any stuff or do anything like that to get a bit of light, that's fine, but just make sure it's genuine. Can you tell me back at five years of laugh at it? And actually, yeah, make it actually funny if you're gonna at least do it. Yeah, that's something we talked about. It's like, if you're thinking about it, and this is something that I think we talked about a while ago, that when you die, what do you wanna be remembered for? Let's talk about our shittiest cartoons ever and why we made them. The shittiest thing you've ever made. Oh. Oh, geez. What's the shittiest thing you've ever made in the story about a star? I'll say it, I'll say it, Cloud and Rubbery, I hate that. And we clarified, we put on this. All right. We answered this, Jeff did a great job with the clown. I'm proud of the admission I did that. I'm proud of everything except for the writing. The writing, that is filth. I hate the writing of that. And I think Jeff salvaged the best he could with his voice acting, but I butchered that cartoon so badly that I spent so long on it that I hated it. You're way too smart on yourself. Yeah, maybe I am, but. It's like, it's not bad at worst. It's not bad at all. That's my point, that's why I hate it. If it was like horrible, then you should kill yourself, but it's not bad. The fact that it's not even horrible and entertaining, it's also that great, it's like a one greater. I like it, it's not bad.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:41.290 --> 1:24:41.661]: 
  Oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:56.612 --> 1:24:57.034]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:25:07.446 --> 1:25:08.678]: 
  Shrees thing....

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:12.627 --> 1:25:14.939]: 
  I'm going to just go and go outside. Cloud Robbery, you'll see.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:25:36.100 --> 1:25:37.770]: 
  your way to farther than yourself.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:38.074 --> 1:25:39.188]: 
  Don't baby high up at l

 SPEAKER_03 [1:25:51.338 --> 1:25:57.480]: 
  I like it. It's not bad. It's still better than almost everything on animated on YouTube. It was because it was rusty.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:25:55.911 --> 1:26:15.773]: 
  It was because I was rusty I was trying to come back after like a year ago This would be come back video and it just fucking hit it's really weird coming back from not doing this I mean, I was just like oh, so you do videos right? My feedback was alright, but it was one of those things where I was super insecure with the small things Yeah, so the one end of like every thousand comments. I was like the writing was terrible. I was like oh

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:03.893 --> 1:26:06.205]: 
  That's what I mean, I was just like, oh, that's what you do videos, right?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:16.448 --> 1:26:17.444]: 
  You're fucking all over me.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:29:34.999 --> 1:29:35.944]: 
  Who knows?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:29:38.273 --> 1:29:43.335]: 
  What's something like that? I wish I had not done that. Put that out. Is there something you've done where you're like, I should not have done that?

 SPEAKER_04 [1:29:43.335 --> 1:29:49.950]: 
  No, I try to stay away from that. I try not to offend people. She's so upset.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:29:46.896 --> 1:29:47.942]: 
  I try not to offend her.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:29:47.504 --> 1:29:52.448]: 
  Oh, thank you. Oh, look at you. Oh, look at you. Look at you. Look at you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:29:49.950 --> 1:29:57.072]: 
  You know it's something you did. That you thought was that big. She's not just drawing all of us, like, dead half the time all day.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:29:52.448 --> 1:29:54.642]: 
  She's not drawing all of us.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:29:58.827 --> 1:30:03.450]: 
  Whatever. Wait, wait, can I say one thing? No, one two things. OK, wait. Two things. Two things. Two things.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:29:58.894 --> 1:32:53.264]: 
  Whatever. Wait, wait, can I say one thing? No, one two things. OK, wait. I thought two days ago they turned it off. One thing, uh. Wait, I was in a Skype call. I did it, I did it, I did it. Should I talk? I did it, I did it. Fuck. I'm sorry. I want to say it. Zach, many years ago, I was in a Skype call with you. I said, Zach, I can do a perfect Vegeta impression. And I did it. And then we both wrote a really stupid script. And then we made it into Dragon's Ball P, right? No, it would happen. It was a little bit different than that, slightly different. You were like, yeah, go Vegeta, whatever you did. And I typically, whether they produced it or not, I was like, you did it. You animated it. It was like four lines. Yeah, it was the super same. And you turned that four lines into a whole cartoon. Yeah, right. So that's how that came. And I liked the first one. I really enjoyed making it. And then I started making the second one, because I always wanted to do something with Frieza, because I love Frieza. But the second one didn't turn out how I wanted it to. And Zach saved it. Zach wrote the ending to a Koosie Genius. Oh, fuck. What the fuck? And Goku came towards the end. That's when I was visiting Ireland. And I was like, you know, get on the endless. I was like, what if, you know, Goku's face gets really big sometimes, like in the clouds. Yeah, I was like, yeah, Goku's face will smile down on them. And I was going to write another joke for that. But then I had the perfect ending, so I did that. But what I'm starting to say here is I enjoyed making one. Two, I got stressed out about making it. And I started not liking it. And then when I released it, I was like, I'm not happy with it, except Zach saved it. I feel like the first half of what's bad with the second half is good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The first half is kind of weak. I'm just trying to say, I didn't mean for it to become this fucking plague of YouTube icons and fucking. I already knew it. I didn't think the same when I. Right? So I just want to say something about Dragon's Ball P. I was on some video, I was going through weird, deep, deep, deep videos I was kept going through. And I got to some weird eugenics debate. And one guy was like, I was really as cocky as he was like, all the neighbors in the country must have heard. And he had a fucking Dragon's Ball P icon. Oh my god. Should I say anything? I'm not done yet. Wait, I just wanted to say, I'm glad people like it. But it's one of those things where it got too big. And I don't like that. Because now that's what I'm known for. And everyone grows. Everyone grows away from things. I've grown away from that now. When people come up and say, I love Dragon's Ball P, I don't know what to say anymore, because I don't think it's very good. It's funny now. I like the first one for being funny. And I like the end of the second one for being funny. But what really pisses me off, what really infuriates me, OK, that's the same thing. But what makes me sad. That would be too. Upsets you. What upsets me is, Leviosa 1 was the same deal. I thoroughly enjoyed making that. And I liked the first one. And then the second one was so super tri-hard. And I was like, yeah, she pretty much gets raped. And I thought it was funny at the time. Your original version was really creepy. It was worse. It was worse. If you could believe that, his original, you don't be. I was like, Chris, that's too rapy. Yeah, no, no, it was. I remember in the original one, she actually pretty much gets raped. So in the new one, I made her enjoy it. She's light-heartedly. She's stop. Yeah, yeah. All it took was the. Before she was screaming, stop.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:29:58.995 --> 1:29:59.940]: 
  Whatever.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:30:03.535 --> 1:30:03.855]: 
  Well

 SPEAKER_02 [1:30:20.714 --> 1:30:21.085]: 
  its on real

 SPEAKER_02 [1:30:30.923 --> 1:30:33.623]: 
  It was like four lights, but it was the super-share.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:30:35.580 --> 1:30:36.677]: 
  Yeah, right, so that's how

 SPEAKER_04 [1:30:47.882 --> 1:30:51.882]: 
  What the fuck is going on?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:30:48.692 --> 1:30:48.794]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:31:20.502 --> 1:31:20.957]:

  I like the

 SPEAKER_02 [1:32:34.482 --> 1:32:37.064]: 
  It was worse. It was worse. You could believe that his original

 SPEAKER_02 [1:32:48.674 --> 1:32:49.669]: 
  É, é.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:32:49.669 --> 1:32:49.956]: 
  예예

 SPEAKER_04 [1:32:53.264 --> 1:32:58.950]: 
  No, no, no, all it took, all it took to change it was a facial expression.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:35:09.715 --> 1:35:11.301]: 
  Something I regret making.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:35:11.234 --> 1:35:15.503]: 
  like no the people over quoted a lot he's like oh god I wish I would do the first technique

 SPEAKER_03 [1:35:14.676 --> 1:35:25.662]: 
  The first techman cartoon I made was quoted a lot. I can't even fucking remember the lines now. It's like, ah. Damn, gotta be a dad. Yeah, gotta be a dad. Yeah. Let's just shoot my dick on. Ha ha ha ha.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:35:20.380 --> 1:35:22.371]: 
  Damn, gonna be a dad.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:35:25.662 --> 1:35:33.475]: 
  Oh my god, that was crony. I love, I love Stapley. I love Stapley. Stapley's parody was the best because it was stapley and pointless.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:35:28.379 --> 1:35:29.914]: 
  I love you. Yeah, stay up.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:35:30.893 --> 1:36:08.474]: 
  because it was stupid and pointless. I got really weird too because people got too popular for its own good on Newgrounds at the time where people started getting mad and just like, oh, it's just a bunch of dick jokes. And then they start making these hateful parodies of it. And then one night, this kid sent me this hateful parody. And clearly he was just trying to take shots at me with it. And it was like, I'll show you how to do a hateful fucking parody. And I made one poking fun of myself even harder than he was. And I sent it back to him. Like, no, this is how you make fun of me, asshole. And then that ended up being almost as popular as the original one, which is even weirder.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:35:52.864 --> 1:35:54.450]: 
  I'll show you how to do a hateful fucking parody.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:35:54.450 --> 1:35:54.822]: 
  and I

 SPEAKER_02 [1:35:56.762 --> 1:35:57.235]: 
  I'm just one of myself.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:35:59.800 --> 1:36:02.955]: 
  I said it back, I'm like, no, this is how you make fun of me.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:36:09.908 --> 1:36:13.637]: 
  It was the one where the characters say nothing but cock and balls the whole time.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:36:10.482 --> 1:36:10.887]: 
 會爆

 SPEAKER_03 [1:36:15.190 --> 1:36:22.699]: 
  Cockin' balls, cockin' balls, cock, cock, cock, I don't know, it just went on and on and just... Anyway, it's probably not even funny anymore.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:36:22.480 --> 1:36:26.260]: 
  Where's the big trilogy about the third one?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:36:26.513 --> 1:36:50.104]: 
  You know, I wrote several more and I started making it. But it just got... I ended up being like 15 minutes long and I'm just like, this is... I kind of quit making them because... It started to stress me out because I felt like I wasn't getting better as an artist making them because... Because of simple characters? Yeah, they're so limited and simple. I'm just like, shit, I'm not really getting any better here. So even though people like them and I liked writing them, I...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:36:42.494 --> 1:36:43.455]: 
  Yeah, they're so nice.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:36:44.687 --> 1:36:46.949]: 
  Shit, I'm not really getting any better here.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:36:46.223 --> 1:36:47.370]: 
  So even though

 SPEAKER_01 [1:36:50.425 --> 1:36:54.981]: 
  Is that the goat you think people say when they meet you? I feel like culture. Oh, the creator takes me. Uh-huh.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:36:54.914 --> 1:37:15.417]: 
  Yeah, not anymore. I don't know. It's sort of, at this point, they're kind of fading into history, as they say. A lot of people still remember them, but I haven't made one since 2006. I made the first one in 2006, and the last one was 2009 or something.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:37:07.924 --> 1:37:09.122]: 
  By the law of pain.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:37:10.590 --> 1:37:11.451]:
