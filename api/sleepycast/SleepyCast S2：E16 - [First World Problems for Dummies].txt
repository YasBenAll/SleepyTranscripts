 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:00.497 --> 0:00:22.992]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense. A world enveloped by a seemingly unending ocean of forests. Very deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little cabin. And in that cabin...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:22.992 --> 0:00:44.271]: 
  Welcome to sleepycast. I'm Jeff. I'm here with Nile Chris and Corey or as I call them my friends Cringe autism lord universe What's new in cringe news this week?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:39.546 --> 0:00:41.554]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:44.929 --> 0:00:52.236]: 
  This week on cringe. What new shit is out there that I don't want to watch? I actually, I've looked at it in a cringe video in a while. I usually, oh, uh...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:48.557 --> 0:00:58.952]: 
  Actually, I looked at it in a cringe video and I usually oh probably go animate videos. Those are pretty good They're they're very new. It's like four years. That's like five years ago before you had a

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:54.615 --> 0:01:02.327]: 
  They're very new. That's like five years ago. Before he had a weird little marathon there last week, we were over at Nick's house.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:01.433 --> 0:01:06.445]: 
  We did a discovery, a little discovery. In case you know, there is a subculture.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:06.445 --> 0:01:12.149]: 
  First you got to start off with this it was me you and Shad You know we were all looking at go anime because we're all huge faggot

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:12.149 --> 0:01:15.507]: 
  Don't include me on this, I always- Cory, you were the one who fucking started it!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:15.507 --> 0:01:18.443]: 
  It was your idea to ring the go-item.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:16.317 --> 0:01:17.481]: 
  She is the reason for one of me.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:18.443 --> 0:01:24.045]: 
  No, my idea was Roblox Law like Steve Horton of you. That's what I'm saying! You always start with the...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:21.869 --> 0:01:51.619]: 
  I love you! That's what I'm saying! You always start with the gayest phrases Roboxxolxd Funnyhaxd Try not to laugh It's always you starting this shit You just go home So then Shad is like We're all watching these gay ass videos That are horribly unfunny and terrible And then Shad's like When there is their GoAnimate fetish videos It's true, yeah So then we started to Google or you know Of course you did Yeah So guess what we found? Well, uh, tell me why Instead of fucking fetish videos We found a whole subculture of People against GoAnimate fetish videos

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:39.047 --> 0:01:39.621]: 
  It's true.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:41.342 --> 0:01]: 
  Of course you did.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01 --> 0:01:42.220]: 
  here on ABC ST Butterpomb.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:50.657 --> 0:02:14.721]: 
  Just like a really rant videos about why fetish videos are weird with animated and go anime Oh, no, they were just people either I think some of them were but they were like they show the videos in question That are the ones that are bad and it's just like these like girls walking to room and like yes. Yes. Yes. Yes Yes, over and over and like Microsoft Sam. Oh, that was fucking titties and ass circles. Oh, that was like there's

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:06.925 --> 0:02:07.515]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:08.714 --> 0:02:09.996]: 
  Microsoft Sam.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:09.996 --> 0:02:10.452]: 
  What's this?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:12.021 --> 0:02:47.779]: 
  Oh, that was it. There's circles on their bodies. Nobody listens to this. I don't even understand what you're talking about. Okay, GoAnimate is an animation program for dipshits. It's for little babies. It's worse than the Simpsons cartoon studio. You drag little characters across the screen and make them always do the same expressions where they wave their hands in the air and pretend to dance and shit. But what we're saying is we found a subculture of people extremely aggravated. They're filming vlogs about hating GoAnimate. No, not just GoAnimate. GoAnimate fetish videos. So they're... How do you animate fetish videos? You make these big fucking default circles grow around their ass areas so it looks like their ass is expanded.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:16.139 --> 0:02:16.594]: 
  Okay, go ahead.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:19.345 --> 0:02:20.425]: 
  It's for little babies.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:22.737 --> 0:02:22.889]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:28.221 --> 0:02:28.677]: 
  Right.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:38.886 --> 0:02:38.954]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:47.779 --> 0:02:50.783]: 
  It's very juvenile and poorly done. Or you make them fart.

I was driving down the street. I saw a bunch of old men wearing their gigantic fluffy St. Patrick's Day hats. Yeah, that was very, very effective. It's playing back. Yeah, which is a Scottish instrument, by the way.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:24.861 --> 0:04:27.257]: 
  It's like a skateboard. It's St. Patrick's Day today.

  Did you get it?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:38.749 --> 0:04:58.982]: 
  Did you get pinched for not wearing green? No. I didn't want any association with those guys. An old man or a saw walked up to me and pinched my foreskin really hard. Yeah, he's like, you're authentic Irish. I ain't just gonna walk in the right direction. No, I'm serious. Like, where I come from, it's like you get pinched if you're not wearing green. I didn't know if I was like a thing. It's a salt. That's like what I heard. You can get away with it on St. Patrick's. Jeff, excuse my... excuse my...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:41.331 --> 0:04:43.187]: 
  I don't want any association with those guys.

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:46.394 --> 0:04:49.532]:

  That's it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:57.632 --> 0:05:18.895]: 
  Excuse my excuse my little throwback, but that reminds me get away with holding there reminds me of something that I heard Recently was that if you go to a furry orgy? Yeah, and you're not wearing a first suit. They'll hiss at you Isn't that like terrifying? It's actually really scary. That's terrifying. What is that? Who would do that? I don't think I don't know. I'm just gonna be felt up, but not wearing your furry suit

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:59.792 --> 0:05:00.704]: 
  That reminds me of the last one.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:00.450 --> 0:05:02.172]: 
  way with holding something.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:11.537 --> 0:05:14.339]: 
  What does that have to do with St. Patrick's? I don't think I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:16.515 --> 0:05:24.329]: 
  Why did they... they hiss at you? They hiss at you? No, I heard this. No, I think that's like a small group of like mouth-breathing retards. Yeah, right.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:24.194 --> 0:05:33.610]: 
  I don't know how we went from St. Patrick's Day to Furry's in like three seconds. Yeah, literally the fastest. Well, I made the comparison there between like them pinching you for not wearing the green and the sun's red.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:26.759 --> 0:05:28.497]: 
  Yeah, literally the fastest.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:28.497 --> 0:05:29.729]: 
  No, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:32.766 --> 0:05:36.951]: 
  Now had a nice conversation talking about sewing places.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:36.951 --> 0:05:42.452]: 
  No, we were talking about how depressing it is walking into, like, you know, Michael's Arts and Crafts stores, or just Arts and Crafts stores.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:40.866 --> 0:05:46.789]: 
  Just arts and crafts Well, I told you it's because like just these old people are knowing Wait, what? I'm making this a lighting What? Is it depressing?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:44.444 --> 0:05:58.551]: 
  Wait, what? I'm not gonna say lighting. What? Is it depressing? I think it's the lighting. I'd like to also talk about the atmosphere of these arts and crafts places. You walk in, harsh lighting, old ladies, Hopery, It just screams death. It looks like a place.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:55.412 --> 0:06:09.621]: 
  It just screams death. It looks like a place where old people go to die. They curl up in their felts. And then they're made into fucking knitting dreams. They dry up in the back, they mummify themselves prior. Like old monks did. It's hard to go in there because...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:01.369 --> 0:06:03.462]: 
  They curl up in their felts and then they're made into like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:07.343 --> 0:06:19.645]: 
  It's hard to go in there because they have like if I want to go for art supplies or get something framed or buy like a brush I have to walk through a literal forest of fake awful potpourri

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:17.924 --> 0:06:25.365]: 
  Yeah, it's true. Yeah, you can't everything there is just it's like impossible to find just like a small combination of everything but I think it's a lighting that's

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:22.800 --> 0:06:31.913]: 
  It is a combination of everything. But I think it's the lighting that's depresses me the most. Just that harsh fucking solid tone lighting that's like... I never realized that until you mentioned it. Yeah, it's disgusting.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:28.791 --> 0:06:29.129]: 
 .

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:30.832 --> 0:06:47.944]: 
  Well, I said like the lighting is like in the back it like starts getting darker and more scarier and in the front It's like lit up and that's what I said like people go back there And they don't come back because like there's no one's going back in the area with the fake brushes Like put is that potpourri where it's like this like weird shit. Oh, please the little leaves you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:38.494 --> 0:06:39.844]: 
  Like people go back there and they don't...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:47.944 --> 0:06:50.509]: 
  break up and it smells good. Why'd you laugh at that?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:49.497 --> 0:06:56.365]: 
  Why'd you laugh at that you freak? Because my mommy's to put popery around the bathroom. Oh, okay mind this thing. It's like an old quaint thing. I don't know, popery, like me. I don't know, popery, like me.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:52.855 --> 0:07:16.986]: 
  Okay, mind is like an old quaint Now we're just saying the other day we went to a Kmart and we walked in we're like this is really depressing But then the more we walk through with the less depressing it got that's because you saw toys you like that's true Kmart is like a halo a life-size halo toy, but whenever I walk into Aldi like I don't like going shopping Aldi was one that I could never walk I don't like going shopping because it makes me depressed because you walk into Aldi and it's really depressing

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:02.980 --> 0:07:03.317]: 
  C'est bon.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:11.198 --> 0:07:11.603]: 
  I don't like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:14.961 --> 0:07:20.884]: 
  It's like orange and there's like drains everywhere

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:18.082 --> 0:07:37.574]: 
  There's like drains everywhere. You know what's fucked up about Ali when you walk in the door They force you to go through the first aisle to get into the rest of the store And the first I was really depressing because it's just all this cheap-ass shit Well, it's awesome in some ways because they have all their own brands that are a lot cheaper I love the rotting fruit that they leave out for days at the time. I don't buy fruit there man. I remember I used to go to all these

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:29.423 --> 0:07:31.701]: 
  Well, it's awesome in some ways because they're all

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:31.448 --> 0:07:31.499]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:32.629 --> 0:07:33.591]: 
  I looked through Roddy's

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:34.452 --> 0:07:52.997]: 
  I don't buy fruit there. I remember I used to go to all the space with my dad and he would give me a quarter and that quarter would be mine. I would get to put the quarter inside to pull, because he put a quarter inside to pull out the cart. The cart. Yeah, the cart. And then I got to keep the quarter. So I would look forward to that because I'd be able to buy shit out of little stupid bubble machines.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:47.817 --> 0:07:48.357]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:52.997 --> 0:08:23.069]: 
  You could you hold you open to everything with a quarter. No, we were talking about a C more art stores Yeah, a C more Michaels those and Michaels is worse than a C more a little bit about dollar stores Yeah, it's the same thing. It's just the pricing to walk in I might that owns pounds like dollar shops yet in Ireland It's different though.

  like 40 acres. The front window display in this bug extermination building is a bug museum. But it's bugs that are in little glass cases that have been there since like 1975. So they're all faded and old. They're all bleak shins and stuff. Here's our termite display. What happens to shoes when they get termites?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:42.608 --> 0:11:16.341]: 
  There's another thing that always irks me. It's always been an issue, I've seen these fucking places that don't seem to understand that the sun is actually harmful to your products. These fucking idiots who have DVDs that have been there since the 80s. Yeah, yeah. They're just fucking sun dried at this point. Yeah. And they have this ugly sepia tone white and blue, just gross colors. Like no one's gonna buy, what's that movie? It's like no one's gonna buy fucking Sandlot for fucking the VHS. Nobody's gonna buy They're gonna have sun faded. National Lampoon's Christmas II. These are fucking movies. Anybody ever wants to own in their life? You have to save it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:44.684 --> 0:10:45.240]: 
  It's always been an issue.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:54.505 --> 0:10:54.944]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:54.944 --> 0:10:56.007]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:02.217 --> 0:11:03.094]: 
  I was gonna buy.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:09.878 --> 0:11:11.414]: 
  There's gonna be a high sunbathing at the moment.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:13.776 --> 0:11:19.193]: 
  Yeah, you have to say there's a little bit of charm in those old like video stores. Yeah, when they're not getting drive-by-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:18.029 --> 0:11:28.980]: 
  Yeah, when they're not getting drive by their son, but the funny thing is he he has these like disgusting old DVDs That have never been touched in years, and then he comes out with like new shitty DVDs

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:28.052 --> 0:11:39.662]: 
  is another place that should be bombed. And that's next to the one that has all the old man toilets in the fun story. Collateral damage of all the old man toilets. We have so many businesses in a row that should just be...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:31.984 --> 0:11:32.085]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:34.499 --> 0:11:35.123]: 
  That's so itchy.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:35.123 --> 0:11:43.088]: 
  All these collateral damage we have so many businesses in a row that should be toilets and worthless bikes The entire block should be set on fire

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:40.388 --> 0:12:12.957]: 
  The entire block should be set on fire. Can I just say one thing that really gets me down? Yeah. When I walk into a store and there's no music playing at all, and it's the most awkward fucking shit. That's depressing. No, it's not depressing. It just puts you on the spot, because then they notice you walk in because it's so quiet. Then all the tension is on you, and they're like, Hello, and you're just waving at them like a fucking idiot. That's the stressful part of going into small stores. Yeah. You walk in, you're the only one there. The owner has his eyes locked on you. There's no music. Oh, God. And now you're forced like, Oh, God, I have to like buy something. I like it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:44.033 --> 0:11:44.556]:

  Oh god. And now you're forced like, oh god. It's my worst nightmare. I have to like buy something. That's like a reason why I don't like going into stores that I'm not used to. Cause I'm really terrified of the first experience, like if they're going to be so on me. Cause remember when we ate at that Thai place and like the first time we ate there, these people were just like, my mom made that, she's back there, she wants to know how it is. They keep coming back and see how the food is. And she's like, off. It's like, you're going to guilt trip me so I never want to come back here. I don't want to go to your fucking clothes store with three racks ever again. Pretties you were trying to guilt trip me because your grandma died in these clothes. I didn't want to do it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:14.796 --> 0:12:15.842]:

  Niall, that's bad advice. There's probably some like deep rooted, don't kill yourself. Deep rooted reasons as to why people cut themselves. I know it's like that, but I always saw it as like a cry for help or it's like being unstable. Because it's like you definitely, how you feel back then, you never really know how to act upon things. It's like when people want to commit suicide, at the time they think it's a good idea.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:08.719 --> 0:32]: 
  When you're a kid you don't realize that like people can deceive you you think that it's exactly what it is That's why they have to start saying stuff like like if like if a dragon's flying around a room It's like dragon is not actually real. Yeah, so when kids don't fucking buy the toys

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:20.127 --> 0:32:20.565]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32 --> 0:32:31.349]:

  Build up your immune system. Actually just had a, you saying that I had a weird flashback to when my mom and dad got their Windows 95 and they got a new printer that was like top-end technology back then and I tried printing out a page of a thing I drew an MS Paint at the time. Yeah, but I was like I've got a great idea I'm gonna pull on the page so it comes out faster. I did it like ten times I was like I was like why is there's these white lines on it? So I printed it out over and over wasting the ink and breaking the printer And then they came in they're like this printer is broken. You didn't figure it out that like Paulie. I was a little kid I was like six. I figured that out.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:58.947 --> 0:33:59.909]: 
  I honestly just had a...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:08.245 --> 0:34:08.650]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:33.793 --> 0:34:51.478]: 
  I did pull it out but then after one time I had the like fucking brains to be like okay pulling it out fucks the ink up I got lots of memories like that where I was like I had a little toy of a robot And I just like scrape his legs across the bonnet of a character. I thought look cool. These are dumb

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:47.985 --> 0:34:56.440]:

I was in America No, no, you know like a Like Maggie Simpson has a dummy. I had one of those and I remember I remember thinking I was like in my head I was like if I throw this into the ocean will I cry? So I like pulled it out and I threw I went and I threw it in the ocean and then I cried I was like and then in my head. I was like, okay. I do cry when I Remember that in my head and then choking. No, I know I was like I was thinking of it in my style You were having like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:56.440 --> 0:35:00.220]:

  and then

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:38.273 --> 0:35:56.903]: 
  in my head. You were having like variable thoughts like fucking taking like the scientific method. I see where to go. It wasn't in those words but I was like. You were like my hypothesis. I remember wondering in whatever baby that I'm going to have in my head. You were smarter than me. I thought. It's like a science fair. I didn't even know about variables and hypothesis. And I have this other memory when I was like.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:41.817 --> 0:35:44.449]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:14.504 --> 0:36:19.195]: 
  I wasn't a baby like I know I was putting the voice on but like I remember

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:18.368 --> 0:36:25.995]: 
  I remember, I was like an old man who's like an old British man who's narrating a baby David Anber Yeah, Dave Nathburn. I wonder what would happen

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:23.549 --> 0:36:32.442]: 
  Yeah, Dave Nathburn was like, I wonder what would happen if I spilled the milk. I swear to God I remember that. Yeah, I got a bunch of weird really young memories too, but only little flashes of it. Why do you regret that?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:28.662 --> 0:36:28.864]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:31.463 --> 0:36:37.943]: 
  Why do you regret that? We're talking about the most biggest regret. Oh, biggest regret. Yeah, you're throwing my pacifier now. That's your biggest regret.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:35.445 --> 0:37:31.639]: 
  You're throwing my pacifier in the ocean. That's your biggest regret. I was a kid. I don't know how to do it. Mine was, I was coming out of pediatrician with my mom and I picked up a rock. I was trying to throw it over a car. It landed right on the hood of the car. Oh my god. My mom freaked. She's like, get in the car now. We're going. Get it. Get out. I was like, I still remember it. I was like, I feel so guilty about it. I didn't know. You just thought it was funny. You were trying to just throw it around. I was just a little guilty person. I don't remember how I looked at it. I remember stuff I did when I was 13 and 14. I tried to fit in with a group. And I really didn't like doing this, but I needed to fit in with the group, the cool guys. And they were all throwing little pebbles at cars. And I was like, this is fucked up. What's that to do? So I started doing it. And then I did it once. And it didn't hit. It missed the car. But then the car started chasing us. And the guy got out, found me because I was hiding behind a bush. Got me up like that. And he's like, I'm fucking taking you to a fucking police station. And I was like, do not cry in front of the cool people. Do not cry. And then I started kind of tearing up. I was like, god damn it. That's my biggest regret, I think, just doing that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:37.943 --> 0:36:38.955]: 
  Brett, what do you want?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:40.339 --> 0:36:40.947]:

  I didn't know. You just thought it was funny. You were trying to just throw a run. I was just a little kid. I don't remember how I was.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:10.967 --> 0:37:12.790]: 
  I was like this is fucked up. Well that's the way you, you were.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:31.285 --> 0:37:39.047]: 
  I have a story. Did I ever tell the story of when I pushed my sister off of like off of like a flight of stairs? Which broke her arm. Jesus. I know no

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:37.613 --> 0:37:41.292]: 
  Jesus, no. I've heard some of this, but I don't know if you told on the podcast.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:40.819 --> 0:39:29.950]: 
  Okay, well, that's one of the biggest regrets because I could have killed her so probably wasn't smart But it was like we were going I remember I was really excited because we were going for ice cream and my sister was running up the stairs And she pushed me first of all she's the fucking instigator So it's her fucking fault that I almost killed her but she was running up the stairs She pushed me and then I'm like ha so I push her back Then she fucking almost kicks me in the face running up You know she's like sticking her tongue out and I'm like you bitch and I run up and I shove her Then she comes back to try and fucking elbow me like this is like a street fighter going thing going up the stairs And so I fucking take her and I we did well first of all there wasn't railing on the fucking stairs Okay, so I fucking just pick her up and throw her off the side of the fucking stairs because we were going up And I just had the genius idea of shoving her off the side of the stairs I was only the biggest fear so she fell down and She was silent when she hit the ground. She went like Like clump like that and I thought the first thing that went through my head was I'm like, oh my god I'm gonna be in so much fucking trouble. I did not I don't think oh my god I killed my sister but then she's like started doing that one baby like And I'm like, oh, okay good. She's a lot So I was relieved by my mom. That was the maddest I've ever seen my mom like she picked me up by my hand Like one hand she carried me into the air. She basically threw me into my room like she was so mad She didn't know what to do first of all She was freaking out because she thought I might have just lost my mind and almost tried to kill my sister So she thought I was probably dangerous to everyone else in the house She threw me into the room and she pushed over a fucking like like Cabinet like a fucking bookcase. She pushed it over so I couldn't get out So the fucking thing was like that because there was no door on our wall So she put a fucking bookcase in front of me with like my stepdad and then she like was screaming I mean she's like you had no idea what you did She's like you you just wait till we figure out what happened and she was hyperventilating and screaming and I was just like What did I do? What did I do?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:10.013 --> 0:38:11.447]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:29.950 --> 0:39:37.493]: 
  in my room. For some reason though, when you talk about you being a kid, I remember I think of you with your exact head now on a baby's body.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:37.493 --> 0:40:16.795]: 
  And so now, if you're talking about stuff I used to do when I'm a baby, apparently I used to actively fall downstairs and laugh afterwards and try to do it again. That's real. That's not surprising. That's real. I remember my mom said she had those like one little jump stair things set up and I was screaming and like, you know like- What's a jump stair thing? They're like things that you put at the end of the stairs where kids like fucking hop and like- So you're a good idea. They're like that and then she went downstairs and she was doing something and suddenly she heard like a do do do do do do do do. And then I fucking like land down the ground but she pulled me up thinking I'd be freaking out and like- Wait. But I was like laughing. I was crying so hard that I was laughing. They made stair travel means- And I was like turning around to try and crawl up the stairs to do it again. They made like stair travel?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:51.077 --> 0:39:53.794]: 
  I was screaming and like, you know, like, jumps their thing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:57.625 --> 0:39:57.962]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:15.529 --> 0:40:23.646]: 
  They made like stair-travels. No, he's talking about those things. You hang wires from the roof with a little diaper at the bottom and you put your legs in and you bounce up and down. Oh, the little mobiles. Or not mobiles. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:20.744 --> 0:40:26.059]: 
  Oh, the little mobiles or not mobile. Yeah, yeah, I regret doing that because I could have those for a dollar

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:24.996 --> 0:41:13.680]: 
  Why don't they have those for adults? Those things are sweet. Yeah, they actually are. I'd love to get a one of them. Well, because they're like strangling your balls, though. That little harness is... Not if you have a little hole to put your wiener in balls at, though. Yeah, but then everyone would see the exact imprint of your wiener in balls. No, they'd actually see your wiener in balls to be hanging out of a hole. So that's... So, Kristen would speak English when he was a kid. Oh, yeah, I didn't talk proper until I was like four. You spoke Irish? No, no, I spoke gibberish. It was like... Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That was shit like that. There were videos of it. Four? Yeah. There was a video on YouTube of me talking about the Easter Bunny. And I'm like... And his Bishko did a scam. It was like... I was retarded. I didn't have any... Your little sister's like... Or your big sister. She was one year older than me. She's talking elegantly. The Easter Bunny is a mythical creature. Yeah, I'm like... A Bishko bucket stile. And then Kristen's like bluby blam, blam. My mom and dad don't even laugh or react because they were just used to it. They just like... Like horrified.

Well, maybe but we're back when we were like flicking the bean No, no, no, it just means kissing like making out with a girl the girl kissing Why is it called shifting?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:29.500 --> 0:42:30.445]: 
  I don't know if they do anymore.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:30.445 --> 0:42:30.715]: 
  Well, that's it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:31.980 --> 0:42:32.352]: 
  There's just like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:33.297 --> 0:42:34.326]: 
  No, no, no, it just...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:35.254 --> 0:42:38.140]: 
  out where your tongue kissing. Why is it called shifting? I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:41.582 --> 0:42:44.502]: 
  Biggest goal of a guy. I would not shift, Jeff. That was literally...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:43.877 --> 0:42:49.919]: 
  That was literally all guys ever talked about at school. Yeah, they just wanted to shift every girl. Shift anyone last weekend. And I remember it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:45.717 --> 0:42:47.809]: 
  Yeah, they just wanted to shift every drill.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:48.923 --> 0:42:54.846]: 
  I remember what happens whenever they discovered shanking is like throw everything off that they didn't get murdered

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:52.450 --> 0:42:56.567]: 
  Throwing everything off. That's murdering, Cory. That's killing people with a knife.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:56.483 --> 0:43:00.600]: 
  Well with a fucking homemade knife but a fucking bit of a mirror

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:58.677 --> 0:42:59.301]: 
  for that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:59.301 --> 0:43:02.423]: 
  Fucking bit of a mere shift them after you shake them. No

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:00.600 --> 0:43:00.617]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:01.731 --> 0:43:08.819]: 
  No, no, because that would be neck and field. No, I remember it was this underage disco.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:06.490 --> 0:43:11.687]: 
  I remember this underage disco make that popular you have to be 14 to get it

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:09.409 --> 0:43:12.700]: 
  You have to be 14 to get in. Shankin' shit.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:12.700 --> 0:43:29.052]: 
  Shaked shift. Did you get a shaked shift? Shaked shift or shaked shift? Shaked shift. Did you get meeted, shanked and shift at the same time? What is meeted? Meet is the same thing. It's just different areas of our knowledge. Why meeting? That doesn't make any sense. It's the stupidest word ever.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:15.720 --> 0:43:18.437]: 
  You gonna shift to Shank or shake a jigs?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:21.509 --> 0:43:33.338]: 
  What is the meaning? Yeah, what is the meaning? The same thing. It's just different like areas of our knowledge. Why meeting? That doesn't make any sense. I know it's stupid. It's the stupidest word ever. It's so confusing. Because then you're like, oh, I meet my friend after school. The actual term for meeting, then people are like, ah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:33.338 --> 0:43:35.802]: 
  Ah, you're shifting your friend. Yes.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:35.262 --> 0:44:02.481]: 
  Anyway, there was like under underage discos. I remember when I was 14. There was a I didn't get a shift yet There was this like mildly retired a guy called that actually I shouldn't say his name Call him Efron close to Michael Efron Efron Efron and he was such a fucking crazy Jebode I'm too lost now to continue my story. I don't even know what I was gonna say. His name's Efron Well, my first ever shift was with Efron was with Zach Efron from high school musical You fucking wish you could never get as good as Zach Efron

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:47.445 --> 0:43:47.850]: 
  And he was like,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:49.285 --> 0:43:51.630]: 
  F-R-O-N-G-O-B-O-D-E.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:59.663 --> 0:44:04.270]: 
  You fucking wish! You'd never get as good a Zac Efron. You had dopey Zac Efron with you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:04.270 --> 0:44:47.250]: 
  Anyway, uh, yeah, my first ever shift was a game of thruettin' there and I pretended all my friends I always get I was like I shipped everyone, but it was a game of thruettin' there. I saw my first pair of titties Truettin' there. Yeah, but it was the butch kind of dyke from like my neighborhood that I ended up shifting And then my friend thought it was funny that I was shifting hers So he kept daring me to shift her I was my first ever shift But then there was these underage discos called that millennium madness and I remember like the only people I'd ever get Cuz I was like this little short fat I was short until I was like 17 and then I just succumbed to being a fat a short fat guy I was like I guess I have to be the funny guy now because I'm short and fat and I have nothing else going for me So then I became 17 and I got like skinny and like tall But anyway, you'd shift all these gross skanks And you try to finger them on the dance floor and everyone would laugh at you and you get kicked out and that was shifting

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:11.982 --> 0:44:12.505]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:12.505 --> 0:44:12.792]: 
  Cheers.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:47.436 --> 0:45:13.255]: 
  We're talking about disco dancing. I think I said this before. When you were 13 or 14, did you ever go to underage ones when you were like this? No, the only time I ever went to the equivalents of dancing was when I went with my fucking dad to the comedy show and downstairs was a bunch of cougars and old people that are just... Did you ever go with a cougar? No, they're just downstairs dancing to fucking... Who started this? Or fucking... Superman! Or that one song by like, everybody in the... Ha, that fucking is wrong.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:49.967 --> 0:44:51.503]: 
  when you're 13 or 14.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:52.094 --> 0:44:53.039]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:12.749 --> 0:45:15.820]: 
  I'm like, yeah, everyone's just

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:15.027 --> 0:45:24.443]: 
  Yeah, everyone's just dancing to that and then like there were I don't like dancing. I hate dancing I have no weird doing I have no pep in my feet. I feel like a goofball

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:16.562 --> 0:45:16.883]: 
  And then like,

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:19.718 --> 0:45:21.540]: 
  I have no

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:24.004 --> 0:45:35.344]: 
  You ever have a gym class where they taught you square dancing? No, what? No. What is square dancing? It's like a Texan dance. It's like you don't fall in, you don't eat, they'll be like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:28.409 --> 0:45:39.192]: 
  No, what? Yeah. Wait, that brings what is square dances? It's like a Texan dance. It's like, yeah, it's like Conn and Joe dancing. I'm not even joking. Oh, there he is.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:37.538 --> 0:45:48.996]: 
  I don't know, I don't know. I don't remember. And you'd like put it around your arm. It's like do do do do do do do do do. It's like seventh grade or something. Yeah, the girls come in, you have to like hold hands and then swing them around. I don't know, I forget. It's like you skip around in circles.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:46.482 --> 0:45:55.459]: 
  I don't know I forget I think you skip around in circles in our other way sides in our bare minimum I was probably like way more like laid back for you the counselor the counselor

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:48.996 --> 0:45:51.342]: 
  We had the bare minimum

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:53.755 --> 0:46:57.947]: 
  The counselor the counselor like well, you know, what do you want to do? Like you have enough credits to graduate, but do you want to do any extracurricular activities? What fucking? I didn't know! Well, Jeff, you're from Philly, right? Yeah. You were like raised here. Yeah. This is a pretty kind of liberal state. Pennsylvania's like two-thirds liberal. Yeah, yeah. So you didn't really, you weren't really forced. Growing up there were three things you were going to do. What are you saying? If it was more, are you saying more conservative states forced you to... Do choir and like other fucking religious... Choir band. Yeah, there was that... Well, the only religious thing I ever had to do was I went to Sunday school for a little while. My friends... Oh, God. I never had to sit through church. I only sat through church once. My grandmother made me, but yeah, I went to Sunday school a few times and that was it. I don't know. I just don't... I don't like it. I remember I like... Because I grew up in Ireland in Christmas. We were like... Like we'd watch TV and you would hear about Sunday school and summer school, but I'd always be like, I'm in Ireland. Why does... Why do churches suck so much? Like why do churches... Why does the inside of churches... They just smell like pine salt and plastic and they just have this awful just atmosphere. Well, it smells like funerals because funerals are hell, then.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:02.192 --> 0:46:03.036]: 
  I didn't know

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:08.774 --> 0:46:09.044]:

  Well, it's...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:57.188 --> 0:47:22.045]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:39.737 --> 0:48:40.969]: 
 おい、これフ

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:41.560 --> 0:48:43.838]: 
  Okay, I'm- I'm- That's just not how it works! Well that's why I-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:52.579 --> 0:48:54.739]: 
  I remember being like, I want to listen. I'm sorry, Jeff.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:54.520 --> 0:49:10.838]: 
  Every time I was like I'm going to listen today, and I never did ever get kind of ignorant to this stuff But I just don't know what are these guys talk about for how long there's church usually every like 40 minutes I'm sorry say passages. It's only 40 minutes. Yeah, but when you're a kid. That's like six hours. Oh my even here is it was

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:57.102 --> 0:48:58.047]: 
  I never did.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:03.092 --> 0:49:07.024]: 
  like 40 minutes and I saw it and say passages only 40 minutes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:08.847 --> 0:49:14.449]: 
  Not even here is it was actually like an hour and 11 minutes. What do you talk about every week?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:14.449 --> 0:50:48.409]: 
  sing and fucking talk about passages. They say like five of the same prayers that we've got like Christ has died, Christ has risen, Christ has fallen. Christ has risen, Christ has fallen. Hail Mary, full of grace, Lord is with thee, blessed art thou. We have the same heart. Hail Mary, full of grace, Lord is with thee, blessed art thou amongst women. I'm just going to avoid, if I die, if and when I die, if... It would be important. I'm not, I just like don't even do the thing in the church, just go out in a field or something and say a few words and stir up your head. I will make sure no one goes to a church. Even like, I went to my grandmother's funeral and it was just the creepiest thing. Just the whole, you know, I probably talked about this before, but the way the guy just silently ate the wafer in front of everybody and drank the wine and... Man, the whole thing was just so awkward and then they start singing a prayer and then all her friends in the pews, they start singing along and it's like this... It sounds like a cult. Whatever, like if I die before my parents, whatever helps them, I don't care what happens to them. I was an altar boy, they never tell you. I was just like, I have to get out of here, I have to get the hell out of here. No, you never need to. I was an altar boy. Wait, you were an altar boy? They were like worshiped where I was, they were like... They were worshiped by the ministeries. I got screamed in my face because I forgot to ring a bell at a certain point. This fat egghead old shit came over to me and he's like, you forgot to ring it when blah blah blah. I was just like, sorry. And I never went back again actually. Dude, I remember thinking, this is weird, but I remember thinking back in the day, it's like only certain people were picked as altar boys. And I was wondering if it was only the ones with the priest. Only the cute ones. Only the cute ones with the little dimples. I had a bold haircut like I do now.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:20.929 --> 0:49:22.330]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:24.186 --> 0:49:26.447]: 
  We have to say that art is like a...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:33.552 --> 0:49:33.670]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:39.930 --> 0:49:41.078]: 
  Yeah, I know.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:03.842 --> 0:50:05.496]: 
  Whatever, like if I died before...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:07.200 --> 0:50:13.529]: 
  I was an altar boy never tell you like I have to get out of here. I have to get the hell out of here No, you never made it all their boys and I got my

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:09.951 --> 0:50:10.559]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:34.285 --> 0:50:36.259]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:40.613 --> 0:50]: 
  Only the one's the priest. Only the cute one.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50 --> 0:51:38.477]: 
  The ones with the little dimples. If I had a bold haircut, like I do now. If we're going back to like when we're talking about like being in church, I remember just being in church and just this one dude just fucking smiling and looking at me the whole time. I was there when I was little and I was just glaring at him because I didn't know who the fuck he was. The same situation happened when I went to church last time. I was just sitting there and my, everyone's dressed in their finest clothes and I'm wearing my patented fucking Shadman shirt and my fucking jeans. Oh, Jesus. But I had a blue hoodie so you couldn't see anything. When were you last in church? When were you last in church? Last Christmas time. And I was sitting in there and this guy was looking at me. He's like, just look at me for like 10 minutes. And he's like, do you like peppermints? And I'm like, no, that was the end of that. And he kept on like fucking looking at the kids while they were just tearing the fucking altar apart just like destroying everything. And then by the end of it, he gave, he was like, you guys want peppermints? And he gave everybody peppermints. I had a sneaking suspicion that they had fucking clover for him. Apart from like funeral. That's how I was in church. Clover runs a gap like seven years.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:08.457 --> 0:51:10.870]: 
  Oh, Jesus. But I had a blue hoodie, so you couldn't see it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:10.448 --> 0:51:11.629]: 
  So you couldn't see anything.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:14.852 --> 0:51:14.937]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:14.937 --> 0:51:15.494]: 
  and I was sitting there.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:35.085 --> 0:51:54.711]: 
  Apart from like funeral last time I was in church. I thought Clorum's a gat like, well Clorum, hey if I walked into any church around here on Sunday and just sat in the back, do you think everybody would look at me like you're not part of this? No, I don't think so. Yeah, because then I'll be dark skinned. Me and Chris, we're talking about like, we really want to go to like, you know what, like a black gospel kind of church. So it's about to say, if you went to church, we just like, you really go white chocolate.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:38.494 --> 0:51:38.562]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:44.181 --> 0:51:45.615]: 
  No, I don't think so.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:45.615 --> 0:51:47.455]: 
  because then all the dark skin...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:50.897 --> 0:51:58.761]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:55.673 --> 0:52:02.018]: 
  I like the music. Yeah. Yeah, but I want to walk in fucking the pale white Irish people like they'd look at us

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:01.613 --> 0:52:05.292]: 
  You think they come in and they have their own Bible where they talk about the white bottles?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:04.684 --> 0:52:11.907]: 
  Christmas fucking church you guys was the bane of my right on in Christmas church. It's actually way longer. It's like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:06.861 --> 0:52:08.414]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:10.624 --> 0:52:14.185]: 
  That's what I'm saying! We went there when it was Christmas! Yeah, it's like an hour and a half.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:12.582 --> 0:52:57.942]: 
  Yeah, it's like an hour and a half and in our church they do a thing every year I'm not sure if this is normal But they they'll sing segments of the Bible and I think it was kind of improv So the organ player would be up there playing a really really really long chord and like like And it's making more slow and boring. No, it's because how else are you gonna do this? So then he's going to and then a lady's gonna be like Like they just sing for fucking it was the whole story of Jesus being respected Fucking stupid who's like who goes like this is cool. This is no nobody Everyone's just afraid of hell. That's all it is. No, everyone's afraid of hell So the reason why else they're fucking God fearing like all people can't we just have like Greek statues everywhere like I'd be neat. Why can't you?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:26.639 --> 0:52:28.225]: 
  and it's making more slow and boring.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:32.950 --> 0:52:34.502]: 
  Then he went to the thing...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:40.982 --> 0:52:42.501]: 
  This is fucking horrible.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:42.501 --> 0:52:43.210]:

  That's what it is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:48.492 --> 0:52:51.833]: 
  No, everyone's afraid of hell. So, the reason why elsewhere's you go.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:57.942 --> 0:53:00.945]: 
  Why can't church just be like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:00.945 --> 0:53:08.354]: 
  Why do we have the depressing Jesus shit like why can't we have statues of Zeus and other gods and everywhere?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:06.666 --> 0:53:16.690]:

  So thinking about opening

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:30.612 --> 0:53:48.735]: 
  PS2. The worst part is when you want to go somewhere and it's just like you're sitting there knowing that this isn't gonna be You see you look at you know the worst part is when you look at the pamphlet And there's like 40 million songs and passages you have to look through and you're like oh We're almost done and then you realize that it's an older version So they like skip the few and then there's actually still 16 more things to see through

  They're not fucking being able to right with their left hand.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:54.666 --> 0:55:05.483]: 
  There's something weird about in the religious circles where they feel left-handers are evil. Left-handed people are wrong. You have to use your right hand.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:05.162 --> 0:55:08.470]: 
  So they just slap the ruler even though he has to somehow learn their hand.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:07.187 --> 0:55:11.339]: 
  They beat your hand until you started writing with your right hand.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:11.069 --> 0:55:38.946]: 
  What if you wrote shitty? Do they slap your hand for having bad handwriting? No, then they just say practice more. So nobody fucking wins? I don't know. Getting slapped for ruler. It's like cruel and unusual punishment for something you can't help. It's disturbing and I, yeah. That's like smacking someone in the face with like little ticks of Tourette's. Like someone who's like, who has to like tick their head. You're like fucking hit him with a newspaper. I just throw those nonsettings downstairs. I wouldn't care. Nonsettings. That's like removing a woman's ovaries because you don't know how babies were. You're like, she has a Satan in them. What is this thing? Guys don't have this. Get rid of it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:49.495 --> 1:03:17.507]: 
  Is it like Super St. Patty's Day in Ireland? No, it's not. America celebrates it way harder. Here's more. It's America's fucking excuse to be like, Oh, we're not the Irish, but they all get drunk, screaming at each other, pour beer on each other, and act like fools. In Ireland, they do that every day anyway. Look, I don't want to be a party pooper, but I think you should all be fucking ashamed of yourself. Well, actually, the whole concept of St. Patrick's Day is that St. Patrick got rid of the snakes in Ireland, which is bullshit anyway. So the whole idea of it is bullshit. Don't leave the snake in the first place! Anyway, this has been SleepyCats. Take it away, St. Patrick.
