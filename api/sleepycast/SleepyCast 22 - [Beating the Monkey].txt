I actually, when I was a kid I had a blanky, but now I have a pillow that I have. It's the only pillow I can sleep on. It's the hentai one. It's not the hentai one, but it is what I use. Like, I smell it when I'm jacking it off. Really? Like, I don't know what it is about the smell of it, but I know one, like, sometimes... Maybe your drool, like, smells like hot women. Maybe. It does. It makes me horny, either way. That is my scalp, Dandruff, makes me horny. Okay, so, evolution at work. Makes Spitz on his dick to jerk off. Then he sleeps on his drool-y pillow and gets horny. Oh yeah. It's evolution. That's absolutely... I could see that. It's evolution. Can it happen?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:29.822 --> 0:04:54.814]: 
  I'm actually lying. Oh, I'm cutting that. I'm keeping your make-a-wish shit. I want to see a good-looking act. You were great. I believe you. Thank you. But the real first question is from Make-A-Wish. What does Make-A-Wish ask? He says, will my cancer go away? You know, that's an interesting question. It's not a good wish. What do you think? I'm not a doctor, kid, but...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:37.872 --> 0:04:38.817]: 
  I believe you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:40.994 --> 0:04:43.289]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:55.776 --> 0:06:36.975]: 
  I talk to the doc you're gonna die dude, but you know something at least you have this podcast Yeah, you know I'm saying yeah, and he got his shout out to yeah, you got your shadows you remember Oh death boy. No, I knew a woman who I cancer and she went to the doctor and he injected medicine to her arms She got better. Yeah, you know cancer is a weird thing on it. No, I'm gonna eject this medicine What kind is being it was the plus sign the plus sign. Yeah the medicine sign. That's HIV positive Chris The AIDS key gets about the cancer. Oh, no, that's how they did it I think that's actually I think that's a true way of getting rid of something I did Cancer is to get HIV there was something it's a candle all that way to take there was a thing where I'm doubling down your bets at this point Someone either cured AIDS or cancer by injecting something bad into them to cancel it out And then they cure the other thing too. Well with with cancer for sure radioactive treatment Yeah, is already pretty bad it like destroys your immune system it f's with your bones I thought if you like walking the Chernobyl you get more cancer That's true or you get superpowers so that they find a way to make radiation Minus cancer. Yeah my healthy radiation. Yeah healthy Basically when you if you get cancer your options are pretty much Definitely die of cancer or maybe die of chemotherapy. That's the case then why don't they put a big because most people who get cancer die of chemotherapy They don't die of the actual cancer really? Yeah, but your options are like I said, definitely die of cancer or maybe die of chemotherapy Oh, yeah, so which one do you choose? I choose the healthy option

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:01.649 --> 0:05:01.682]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:05.142 --> 0:05:06.964]: 
  You got your shadows. You remember his name?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:22.287 --> 0:05:22.455]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:28.075 --> 0:05:28.665]: 
  I guess I...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:33.846 --> 0:05:40.157]: 
  You're getting- No, not cancer. No, it was cancer. I read that. I did. That's the secret cure. No. Google it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:42.537 --> 0:05:43.566]: 
  It's a cable!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:45.203 --> 0:05:46.182]: 
  and saying words like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:47.211 --> 0:05:48.004]: 
  This boy.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:48.004 --> 0:05:50.249]: 
  I think someone cured those kids

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:05.318 --> 0:06:05.790]: 
  I thought it was

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:08.305 --> 0:06:08.575]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:09.959 --> 0:06:10.499]: 
  So that they

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:09.992 --> 0:06:10.634]: 
  so that they find

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:14.599 --> 0:06:15.747]: 
  Yeah, healthy.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:15.443 --> 0:06:15.510]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:21.805 --> 0:06:22.497]: 
  If that's the case.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:34.022 --> 0:06:34.191]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:37.784 --> 0:13:39.795]: 
  Like Steve Jobs did. You know what actually, you know what's funny about that is that a lot of people do say like in order to fight cancer like they do these holistic things where you just jog more and do yoga and listen to Kenny G and eat vegetables. I think the issue comes when people try to do that only like Steve Jobs did. Yeah, yeah, yeah. See he was a moron. But he didn't even do that. I thought he just ate apples until we died. He literally, yeah, he was. He's like, I have cancer. I'm going to eat apples. No, I'm not going to listen to you. No, are you kidding? No. The creator of the Apple computer only ate apples. It's the most ironic death that you could have. That is the silliest thing is that in order to combat cancer. To my knowledge, the doctors, if I fuck up on this, please do put your trust in me. But the doctors came to a pretty, like he had pretty great cancer, which was pretty much a death sentence, but they came early enough to where they were like, we can do surgery, we can do treatment options, and he basically said, fuck you, and it leaves off the trees and then he took a bite of an apple and then he set it on the table and it was the perfect silhouette of their logo. By the way, he didn't invent the Apple computer. He would wait. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I thought he just revolutionized it. No, I think he did create it. Okay, that's fair. I'm pretty sure he did. I was getting ready for an onslaught murdering people, running at me saying that I got it wrong. Did he make Pixar or did he just help fund it? Yeah, I think he had a stake in it. That'll take him. All right. So, Make-A-Wish, Deathboy69, a no scope, got his question asked. Now we've got a question from, oh, here we go, one from Curtis Arnott, aka Takahata101. Oh, oh, skip this one. Shut up. That put a bad fucking taste in my mouth. Something's just pissed me off and that's one of them. You know what? Your username is psychicpebble. Say his name again. I want everyone to hear this fucking ass-mouse name. We all got shitty username. Don't say it again, Nick. His name or his username? His username. You know what I mean. Takahata, Zach is the best. Okay, that's a little bit better. Okay, we did the question. The question is best era of music, but we're only given, hold on, we're only given five options. Okay. So, you can't go any far back then. Yeah, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s or modern, which like you can't say Bach. You can't say anything back in the day. Wait, so, did he go 90s modern or 90s 2000s? No, 90s and modern. So that's like 15 years though. Well, I'm going to get the assumption that it's from 2000. All right, we should practice this with music is subjective. Of course. Everyone's taste. Dude, Tumblr isn't watching our podcast. I know, I was just saying. I post about music playlists to Twitter and people were like, fuck you. You see? No, they didn't. I did. I was even looking surprised. People get furious over musical choices. Your music's not. Do they really? Yeah, furious. I think the most labs you get are music labs. People who don't like your taste of music. Oh, you listen to this? I hate talking to people about music. Some of us walk around eggshells. What about you? Do you feel like you have very strong opinions about? No. I think music is the most subjective thing out of anything. Because it's just, do you know what music is? It's just like frequencies. It's just frequencies you like to hear. So if you like... It's like whatever instruments you can get to make those frequencies. It's not like you can welcome someone to say, I fucking hate the bamboo flutes. Like why? I hate the sound of it. Well, okay, you can't blame them because maybe they don't like it. But then it's like, it just depends on what kind of instruments, what kind of genres and shit. There's no way to say if it's actually good or not. And it's also what you're used to too. I think subjective is the perfect word mainly because all artists are subjective. But what sounds you're used to are the sound. You'll never get most of India to music that's not... Yeah, exactly. They love that shit. Holy fuck. No, I'm just saying, I'm not saying that's bad. You pissed off on a one-idve viewer. No, but like for them, they love that shit. And you know what, the Chinese opera and shit? Yeah. It's like, ta-ching-dang-boing. You know, like they've got their own, like fucking, they've got their own thing and I'm sure there's people sitting back being like, oh yeah. By the way, this is my view. I wasn't trying to do like, I wasn't trying to... I wasn't trying to be racist. I was trying to be racist. There's later me out. I was not trying to be racist. They've got different scales. They've got different ways that music works than we do. And I don't get it. And smaller brains too, you think. Smaller brains, smaller faces on smaller heads. They're small, they're small humanoids. Small primates. Anyways. But what I'm saying is, yeah, like everything, like if we grew up there, we'd probably love that shit. Yeah, no, no, no. But it's weird because like, the weird thing about bringing that up is because I listen to older stuff. Yeah. I don't really like a lot of older stuff. I don't think it's because... I'm not... I get labeled with some music. Like, what, you think music does it sucks? It's like, no. It's just like older music. Some people attack me for liking older music because they think I think older music does it suck. I do think music do they kind of suck to be honest. Yeah. Like, I'm sorry. Like that Anaconda ain't got none unless you got buns, huh? That kind of stuff works. It's a mix a lot and I have to enjoy it because he's from Seattle and I have to. Every once in a while, I'm on the radio and like, you know, look at that. No, no, no. I meant the Nicki Minaj remake of it. Oh, she made a remake of it? Yeah. That's the thing. She just took his music that it was already good and she made it worse. I think the idea would say for music... I think she's a decent hip-hop artist, but I don't like it when they do that so much when they take other shit. Not like sampling. But wait, I was about to say, I think music is kind of nostalgic for everybody. No, I disagree though because I didn't have a taste of music until I was like... Well, that's fine. 17 or 18, maybe 19 even. I think nostalgia is a part of it, but I do think that like, there's a lot of people that later on get into things like these rockers. Yeah. But your taste will change though. Yeah, absolutely. If you hear a song from your childhood, you're not going to go, I hate this. Oh, no, definitely. Like if your dad was singing songs, you'd be like, hey. Whatever you hear like a shitty, cheesy night, these songs, look at all. And it kind of makes sense though with music especially because not only is it accessible, but so many artists today I feel are influenced by past artists. Yeah, definitely. That if you like something, that there's a very good chance if you backtrace it, you're going to find like the roots of some other music. Oh, absolutely. And you're going to be like, oh shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then they got inspired to make shit. This is what, you know, it came from. But I feel like too, like you said, like it's a nostalgic thing. It's a little bit of a nostalgic thing. Oh yeah, it's not totally. If I was 50 years old and heard like this Smash Bros song, I'd be like, what the fuck is this? I'm not like, I only heard so much music when I was a kid. Yeah. Right. You have to discover new music too. So to answer the question in a roundabout way, I personally really like it, it's music. I like the way it sounds. It's that nice period for me. It's a nicely transitional period where it's kind of sydney and like that weird techno we saw. Yeah, but it's not too. It's like dubstep or something, that kind of techno we kind of stuff. It's that nice kind of like weird cheesy. I don't know. Yeah, I like the aesthetic. But I wasn't, I didn't really live through the 80s. I wasn't alive. Yeah, I was. So, but so I have no bias towards this. It's like I was a Stalgic 4 or anything. I just, I grew to like.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:38.106 --> 0:06:38.967]: 
  You know what actually

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:50.391 --> 0:06:51.218]: 
  I think the issue is that

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:55.994 --> 0:07:03.435]: 
  He didn't even do that. I thought he just ate apples until he died. No, no, no, we didn't. Yeah, he was... He's like, I have cancer. I don't have to eat apples. No, listen to me. No, are you kidding?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:03.435 --> 0:07:04.431]: 
  No! That's actually...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:08.025 --> 0:07:09.139]: 
  That is so good.

  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, your taste buds.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:21.192 --> 0:12:22.221]: 
  Yeah, absolutely.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:24.550 --> 0:12:27.014]: 
  Like if your dad was singing songs you'd be like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:31.030 --> 0:12:31.907]: 
  And it kind of makes

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:47.719 --> 0:12:48.360]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:52.005 --> 0:12:52.309]: 
  We'll see you next time.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:57.017 --> 0:12:57.945]: 
  Yeah, it's not too loud.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:05.910 --> 0:13:06.366]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:16.997 --> 0:13:17.419]: 
  He's got their.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:18.212 --> 0:13:19.259]: 
  See ya in the next video.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:19.917 --> 0:13:22.195]: 
  So it does simply so that kind of...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:22.904 --> 0:13:23.359]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:31.679 --> 0:13:32.775]: 
  Yeah, I was.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:40.639 --> 0:15:48.096]: 
  That kind of stuff. You know, it's kind of funny because I grew up in the 80s But one of my favorite generations of music over time because during what during the 90s We had like the alternative breakout with like Nirvana and the Soundgarden and all you know all sorts of shit And that was what I listened to however As I've gotten older I still love a lot of that stuff Yeah, but the 70s actually became something that I really got into with like Led Zeppelin And even though the doors are kind of out the door at the time and and listening back I'm not so much into the doors But like there were plenty of bands in the 70s that I feel like influenced that 80s sound That's the thing too is it's kind of it's obvious that I see it's a bit It's really fun to kind of go back from songs. I was doing like these things since like the 60s up until like the 80s And 90s. Yeah, it's funny. It's kind of slowly see it progress. I've always enjoyed that What would people call Frank Sinatra's music would that be 60s? Yeah I mean he was around for so long that it's gonna I guess you yeah, you could see people Maybe the heyday of that was 50s probably yeah 50s. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense I just think it's cool that you can find something good in all music Yeah, yeah, like like if you listen to it like a weird creepy you song from the forest you can still find something good Absolutely, I love there's a lot of like aboriginal like tribal stuff that I love there's a lot of like you know, I Renaissance you know, I really music actually enjoy I've really enjoyed your boring chance I for some reason I don't know why and I think it's because I don't know if I've grown used to it I remember but I watch a lot of documentaries, but for some reason Soviet music is really appealing just because it's a guy It's really really appealing really it's a huge choir of guys see I don't know why Right on require I mean would you want to be a part of that fuck no I would never want to live there, but I just it's it's really fascinating Would you like to sing with them? I there's no way I kids I can't sing by myself would you if you had a choice between hiring a deaf leopard cover band or a bunch of Russian dudes to sing at a party if I could if I could

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:17.258 --> 0:14:17.849]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:52.814 --> 0:14:53.759]: 
  Absolutely.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:01.116 --> 0:15:02.196]: 
  and live music

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:30.934 --> 0:15:31.255]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:45.177 --> 0:15:47.539]: 
  If I could, if I could, if I could.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:49.193 --> 0:16:11.417]: 
  I feel like you can get away with the second one. With the live I think. Don't you? You have a fucking family that's singing! That's true. Okay. We got bellies. Fucking... What was I gonna say? I was gonna say it's cool that you can have an artist write a song and it's good, but then someone in the future will make it way better. Yeah. Like Mad World. Like you were here the original version of that? Yeah. It's like... Udub Udub Udub Udub Udub Udub Udub Udub!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:04.380 --> 0:16:04.600]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:07.907 --> 0:16:08.515]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:12.126 --> 0:19:39.317]: 
  Then it was nice But I Declosed on I don't I wouldn't I feel like I Don't really feel like I could say music today is bad or worse. I don't think I could say that no I think there's always been bad music. I always think there's always been bad movies I always think there's always bad literature, but we just were the good stuff But I would say the only the only thing I would say objectively of a music today that could be considered worse is I Feel like 30 or 40 years ago. Yeah, there's no way to cheat the system, right? You could be a bad see the now it still be popular. Yeah, that's the only thing I know today, and that's why I would say that today more than any other time I mean boy bands It's good. It's good. It's so we don't cuz anybody could be big right you could be big now I really don't like that pop music mentality where you go into a club and they'll play be playing all the music that just came out Yeah, and in a month. It's forgotten forever. I called you all This is always this is kind of culty in a way it is a little bit I never thought of it that way weird, but it is like programming like you know listen to it in your car And I'll go to the club listen to it again Yeah, and it's like a re it's like a remixed version of it But it's still the message and it's still the same like basic principles of the song. Yeah. Yeah, yeah So I would say it's like big difference today Yeah, I mean there's still I mean like you were you're right though in the other generation has It's pros and it's cons Listen to the radio there's always a bit of that's a nice song And I but you know but I would go to my way to listen to it radio is just so hard though radio Yeah, to me. It's like not only is it a dying medium to a degree to a degree. I mean relative It's a shifting what I would say it's something else. It's more veins of but the the radio has a problem And the problem stems from how the model works in where they play shit until you hate it Yeah, yeah, they'll take a good song. You'd be like, yeah, I like this song two days later Okay, shut the fuck up like can I hear something else? I can't drive yet, and I don't have a radio song I don't have to deal with that yet. You would Whatever high school and I used to use to drive to high school My driver's a little longer because they were to move out of district or whatever But we say I still went to that school through some weird loophole So think of 50 20 minute drive ever every day I would listen to the fucking radio for 20 minutes and then you're the same yeah songs ever station Which is fine. Yeah, I think I think it's like why the TV model doesn't work because on a radio Whatever's there you have to listen to it. Even if you don't want to it's a TV It's like oh I can either watch I can watch go until seven o'clock and wait till my shows on yep We're good at flicks. Yeah, so I feel like more people use their cell phones with the Luxora cable now That's exactly used to use the radio really Yeah, you think pop music's more like catered towards girls so girls are more into the I would say girls I would say the younger audience general but like I don't remember dudes listening to that stuff when I was actually really I'm thinking about it now in terms of pop music You think about all the pop stars that are like really big right now You've got like people like what maroon five or Taylor Swift or yeah, or whatever it does really seem more Oriented towards the girls. I would say it's like 75 I don't know I feel I feel like that probably changed like the 80s or 90s. Well here Well, that was a name name a pop star today that you think has more of a male fan base

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:24.799 --> 0:16:25.137]: 
  Nah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:46.872 --> 0:16:48.998]: 
  That's the only thing I think it's for today.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:53.335 --> 0:16:54.533]: 
  So it's good, it's good, it's all good.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:56.845 --> 0:16:57.908]: 
  You can be big now.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:04.675 --> 0:17:05.940]: 
  It's cycled here.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:05.940 --> 0:17:06.784]: 
  It's weird.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:14.512 --> 0:17:14.631]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:23.018 --> 0:17:25.431]: 
  principles of the song.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:37.446 --> 0:17:38.492]: 
  What are good music coming from?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:38.492 --> 0:17:39.454]: 
  out now.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:52.887 --> 0:17:54.321]: 
  It's a shifting word, say it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:10.960 --> 0:18:12.833]: 
  Can I hear something else? Please drive.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:15.162 --> 0:18:19.330]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:15.719 --> 0:18:16.005]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:52.860 --> 0:18:53.181]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:57.417 --> 0:18:57.957]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:04.437 --> 0:19:04.470]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:09.280 --> 0:19:09.854]: 
  It's actually

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:26.189 --> 0:19:27.488]: 
  I think it's because they really...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:31.150 --> 0:19:33.006]: 
  Oh, here, that was a bulldog.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:40.684 --> 0:24:13.030]: 
  I don't know, I don't know, I don't really know what kind of pop stars are on it, I hate to say it, I'm not really... Yeah, because I feel like back when you had like Michael Jackson and stuff. I was always griffin' Michael Jackson, but it was so much a problem. Yeah, and I feel like there was plenty of guys and girls that really liked him, but I'm trying to think now. But like a lot of his songs weren't just about like love and like fucking girls. Yeah, I mean they weren't about love, they weren't really about... I don't know. I feel like it's the core of most songs because that's like the most hear-the-ever about love. It's the easiest thing to write about, which is why it's been written about so much. Yeah, yeah. It's like why movies have it too. Almost every movie has a fucking love interest story, because it's relatable or whatever, you can just easy, you can just do it. Everybody gets that, but it's risky to write a fucking song about a Tupperware, I don't know. You know, it's hard to... I used to do it. Same thing with movies, you could do a really good song about Tupperware, I'm sure, or a really good movie about forks, but... You know, you could do something weird, but it's hard, it's way harder to do that. Brave little toaster made a good movie. Yeah, there we go. That's true, that's true. So what do you think, Chris? If you had to choose between 60, 70, 80, 90, or modern, what would you choose? I'm the worst person to ask. You have to choose one. Choose one. The guy asked the question, you fucker. The most... let's see. Peel-a-gee-you. Best era. Look, that's the thing, right? I don't listen to any of this music. I like... Pig it! I'm weird. Listen to me, I like Game Center tracks. What's your favorite music? I like Game Center tracks, I like Movie Soundtracks, I like catchy songs, but that's the thing, right? If I was to actually say which is the best, even though I've got no interest... What's your favorite then? What's your favorite game or movie soundtrack? What decade produced the most interesting best soundtrack? I like the Back to the Future soundtrack, that was 85. What cup also? Rotobocop was a great soundtrack. But like... It's all 80s too. They're not asking that. Okay, so which decade had the best music? I would say the most... What's the word? Timeless? Probably the 70s. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of stuff was rooted in that. 70s or 80s, I would say it's a tie. I said 80s before, I still think 80s... You just threw a tie in there, just kind of off the cuff, like... Like I said, I think it's hard to do the 60s... I would prefer music from the 80s, but I would say that the 70s would be... The 80s definitely has a feel to it, you know what you're listening to? Yeah. If something from the 70s you could go, what else fits on genre too? You know what, fucking idiot, I don't know what to say. We're all idiots, that was the whole point. This is the most subjective shit ever. It's true. So, here's another question. This one is from Phil Sutfin. And he had... This is actually kind of a long one, I'll try to blaze through it. What's it like going to a con as an E celebrity? For example... Okay. I remember Chris. The Chris, Oni Nji, right here. This guy right here? This is very rude. He's picking his nose? I remember picking his nose in a Batman shirt. I remember Chris telling a story in a stream about a surreal moment at a con. He said that someone in an elevator, full of people... Yeah, Zach was like... Zach was apparently there, shouted, Oni cartoons! Yay! No, no, no, it wasn't like that. It was weird, it was weirder than that. It was way weirder. Zach stepped into the elevator, we were like... You're the back of it, Zach. We were crushed against the back. It was full of like 30 people, and the doors closed. And then somebody was just like... What is it like Chris O'Neill's panel line? And I was like, wait, what? And then someone was like, Oni cartoons, yeah! And then like two other guys said, Oni cartoons, yeah! And I was just like, what the fuck? And then I stood out of the elevator, and me and Zach looked back into the elevator, and everyone was looking at me, but no one knew who I was. And then the doors closed, and I was like, what the fuck? There's a bunch of people started saying it as well, but none of them seemed to know that Oni was actually there with them. It was a really odd experience. I don't know why it was so weird. That sounds very bizarre. That sounds like a scene from a movie that is kind of like, you know, the slice of life of like YouTube animators or something. It was like that almost. You're like the mall rats of like animators. You're in an elevator of people like, you know, using your catchphrase, and then you stand in front of all of them, and you're like, you know, a single one of them even knows who the fuck you are. What I think might have happened was I stepped in, and some guy might have been like, was that blah blah blah? Never mind, but then he asked the question, you know? Right. So the question is, what's like we do at convention? Yeah. Oh, uh... It's, you know, for people like Chris and I, it's not really a big deal. We don't really get... I preferred it like a few years ago when it was fresh.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:48.548 --> 0:19:48.936]: 
  I was going to say.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:50.151 --> 0:19:51.417]: 
  Yeah, I feel like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:00.023 --> 0:20:00.749]: 
 ...sry

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:48.454 --> 0:20:49.770]: 
  You have to choose one.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:01.380 --> 0:21:04.536]: 
  Like, pick it! I'm weird. Like listen to me. I like game soundtrack.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:07.624 --> 0:21:07.709]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:14.340 --> 0:21:15.437]: 
  What interest?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:21.664 --> 0:21:21.850]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:30.051 --> 0:21:31.283]: 
  So we're... You're right.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:37.020 --> 0:21:37.257]: 
  Mm-hmm.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:39.636 --> 0:21:40.041]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:45.188 --> 0:21:45.964]: 
  Well, you...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:50.200 --> 0:21:50.520]: 
 どう?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:53.406 --> 0:21:53.440]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:57.186 --> 0:21:57.524]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:29.535 --> 0:22:30.329]: 
  This guy right here?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:35.340 --> 0:22:35.678]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:43.575 --> 0:22:45.398]: 
  I was there. Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:49.364 --> 0:22:49.954]: 
  Yeah!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:53.481 --> 0:22:54.561]: 
  It was just way, Gonzaga.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:56.029 --> 0:22:57.042]: 
  We were like, we were like, we were like,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:21.679 --> 0:23]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:28.564 --> 0:23:29.205]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:30.589 --> 0:23:30.623]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:32.530 --> 0:23:33.239]: 
  Let's...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:34.740 --> 0:23:35.112]: 
  That's...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:40.579 --> 0:23:43.937]: 
  YouTube animators or something. It was like that almost.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:43.448 --> 0:23:43.499]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:03.057 --> 0:24:03.124]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:06.212 --> 0:24:07.005]: 
  Oh, uh...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:10.144 --> 0:24:10.684]: 
  We don't really get to see that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:13.637 --> 0:24:48.940]: 
  And also we were a little bit smaller back then, so I was a little less overwhelming. When you see the actual, like the actual internet celebrities like dealing with people, oh my god. I've er, you know... Like the face people. Yeah, like John. Yeah. John Tron. Yeah. It's kind of hard to talk about. Whenever we go to a convention with him, good lord is he's... What's really creepy, this is incredibly unsettling to me. It says fucking shirts on my spine. People dressed up as John. The last thing I said I went to. And so I was, but I kept thinking, I was like, I came with John and he was like, we turned around and he was just some fat lesbian. I was like, oh god.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:18.143 --> 0:24:18.379]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:25.703 --> 0:24:26.884]: 
  Like the face people.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:30.799 --> 0:24:31.862]: 
  It's kinda hard to talk about.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:50.745 --> 0:28:13.414]: 
  Maybe it was John. No, it wasn't John. It wasn't that lesbian. But um, I was gonna go to tea. Not yet. But anyways, I was like what the fuck? It happened like four times! Then it kept on getting heated. The more it happened, it got even more... There were four lesbians dressed as John-Kron? No, and probably two lesbians and two suspect guys. There's like a weird sad truth to it where you want people to come to your panel? Because like that's why you go. It's fresh to see people at your panel. But then if someone comes up to you at any time other than your panel, you're like, you should have come to the panel. But then if there's people stopping you for a photo every minute, it's kind of annoying. Like in a perfect world, where you had all the time in the world and you had nothing to do, it would be great to take photos and sign autographs, have a five minute chat with everybody. It would be great. But I could imagine that once it happens too much, it's just like... Oh, what? I've gotten to the point where if I continue to do what I do, it will get to the point where it's going to be annoying. Right, but what's funny though is from the other perspective, none of these... or not none, but a lot of these people don't know what that experience is. So for them, every time they meet you, it is the first time. It is like so fresh for them. For you, it's like, dude. And it's not like you can't relate. I think when you say annoying, it's not like annoying like they're approaching you. No, no, no, no. It's great. No, it's awesome that they're approaching you. But it's annoying when they stop you when you're in the middle of something or if you're eating dinner or something. I think eating these is a thing. Or if they're like, give me a picture and you're like, dude, I look like shit. I've been walking around for like six hours. That's what I expect. I mean, it's probably something weird to do on that perspective because we're just... It's also hard to know if that's like a douche from talking with this kind of stuff. Yeah. Well, no. We're not celebrities. We're just... Some people notice who we are sometimes. Yeah. Luckily, not me that much, but I'm feeling it. Yeah. It's like, oh, I remember John... We were in New York and John got seriously recognized multiple times a day. Yeah. And it's like he... The guy couldn't just go out and get a carton of milk or something. He'd go get a water until he couldn't walk in his butt, you know, that box. But he's fucking pajama pants. Yeah. He had to look picture quality every time he went out. And it's like, dude, that's... Because of that. Because people would snap off. If you didn't consent to a photo, they'd take it anyway. He had to like, he had to put Jack on his fucking shoulder every day, walk around the city. He had to walk to his theme tune. He had to carry boom box. Yeah. He was fucked up. Wait. What? No, it's not true. Oh, okay. It was like the boom box. Boom box sunglasses on. Yeah. But, I mean, from my perspective, who I've said before on the podcast, I've said before just other places, I don't like those encounters. Not because I don't like the encounters of songs, but I don't like what's behind them. I hate the idea of celebrity, like of celebrities and being a celebrity. I'm not a celebrity, but say I hate the idea of it. I really, really, really don't like the idea of pictures. I don't like the idea of autographs. Because it's me confirming that I'm worth an autograph or a picture. Yeah, but... That's my perspective. So people... Okay, so there's celebrity culture, and then there's just someone who genuinely looks up to you as an artist. I get that, but I guess I have a weird skewed perspective. Because if I saw Larry David or somebody, I would never be like, hey, hey, hey, I've never asked anybody for a picture ever. Right. And that's just me. If I ever met somebody I'd like to be like, oh, I try to treat them like a person. Even if my heart was beat-o to go, God, is this person? Yeah. And that's just a human reaction. I would still...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:55.977 --> 0:24:57.141]: 
  I was gonna show a T. Not yet.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:03.435 --> 0:25:04.262]: 
  There were four of them.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:07.064 --> 0:25:07.502]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:07.502 --> 0:25:08.397]: 
  Back guys.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:22.167 --> 0:25:22.656]: 
  Yeah.

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:09.947 --> 0:27:11.955]: 
  No, it's not true.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:14.453 --> 0:27:15.449]: 
  We're like so glad

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:15.449 --> 0:27:16.478]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:48.034 --> 0:27:48.456]: 
  to people.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:14.039 --> 0:28:55.450]: 
  This is me hanging out at magfest together a lot and and a couple of them And I'm curious now that you mentioned because I know it like your thing with photos Were you asked to get photos a lot? Uh a couple people asked me before and then what did you say? I said I'm sorry. I don't really like doing that. I but I could do anything else for you. I can suck a dick I can suck your boss. You're putting an original make to me and you But no, I just I don't like the idea of that because it confirms that I they're like, oh, yeah I'm worth an autograph or I'm worth a fucking picture I But see It was there for you to make that judgment for them now because because what you're doing in that in that moment though What I what I what I know what I'm saying is I'm not saying

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:14.410 --> 0:28:15.405]: 
  This is me, I am picking you up.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:31.825 --> 0:28:37.900]: 
  Suck your dick. Suck your balls. We're not original making you. No, I just, I just...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:46.017 --> 0:28:46.894]: 
  It was like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:51.822 --> 0:28:52.463]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:56.445 --> 0:30:18.947]: 
  I'm not trying to deprive anybody of anything I'm just saying, you got the wrong idea. Your image of me is not what you think it is. You feel guilty, kind of? I feel guilty. If I sat down with lunch with somebody and they'd expect me to be off the walls, I'd be like, yeah, so I was listening to NPR earlier in the evening. Expectation is different than what people feel when they see me. I get, look, my perspective is, if people like my work, that's great. That's what I want. I want people to appreciate my work. But the guy behind it is a boring fucking guy. Don't do the thing. I'm an average guy and I say that seriously and it's obvious, but people really, really think I'm off the walls and I'm like, no, I have a fucking boring- But what if they want your autograph? Because of the body of work you've done and the joy you've brought to them. And not because you're so crazy off the wall. No, but people do it because they idolize- I understand. There's another aspect to it where I get really guilty feeling when someone comes up to me and says, I'm a really huge fan of this cartoon that I personally hate now because, like, do you ever make a cartoon you grow so far from it? You're like, I fucking hate this. I hated dot dot dot about a month after I made it. Right, so when people come up to you and say- It was literally what Tom Folt would introduce me to people as he was like, this is the dot dot dot guy. And I was like, Tom, so when people come up to you and say, I love dot dot dot, you're like, that was the first thing John said to me. And then he was like, oh, oh, make it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:05.642 --> 0:29:07.127]: 
  But you didn't tell somebody.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:13.962 --> 0:29:14.502]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:29.335 --> 0:29:30.938]: 
  Don't do the thing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:38.616 --> 0:29:40.455]: 
  But what if they want your autograph?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:44.556 --> 0:29:45.974]: 
  though people sub people

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:47.965 --> 0:29:49.095]: 
  I understand.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:01.650 --> 0:30:01.684]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:04.097 --> 0:30:05.397]: 
  Right, so when people clicked you and

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:08.265 --> 0:30:08.805]: 
  That's good work.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:17.057 --> 0:30:17.800]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:18.947 --> 0:30:22.120]: 
  me dot dot dot I love dot dot dot

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:20.483 --> 0:30:46.015]: 
  So you just feel bad about it. You feel kind of guilty because you've grown out of it and you're like you can't escape it, you know? Yeah, that's what I mean. It's like that people go, well, what do you try to hide it? So you've not tried to hide anything. Yeah. I've already been out there. People know my phone name. It's like I'm trying to hide anything. I just I don't like the idea of it. I don't like the idea because I'm not fucking... It's not even that I'm not worthy, but I'm not. It's like I just I think it's pointless. If you want to appreciate anything, if you want to say anything,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:46.690 --> 0:32:15.554]: 
  do it about my work. I am not a celebrity, I'm not a goofy off the wall guy. What I make is what I want to be out there. I don't want to be the spotlight because I don't deserve to be the spotlight. But do you feel like you've put, fine. I think that there's a distinction though between those people who feel like they're celebrity, therefore they propagate that image and they promote it. But I do think as far as the effort that has gone into avoiding that. It's not effort, it's the opposite. It's a lack of effort to do the, to do the other thing. I've never made an effort not to do that. I've made an effort to not, basically what I'm saying is I've never made an effort to not put myself out there. I've just never put an effort to put myself out there. It's a lack of effort. A lot of people will go, I want to be that face. People walk down the street and they go, oh, it's you. I don't want to face the right thing. I want my work, everything should be different. I'm a guy who practiced something and maybe I'll get better at it someday but then that's it. I practice that, that's all it is. I just do stuff. And I'm not purposely being hubby. I really, really, really hate the idea of idolizing the people behind the work. I really don't like it. So it's not about you putting an effort not to put yourself out there. Right, I'm not consciously going to say that. So like if a camera was on you, it's not like you wouldn't take the effort to walk away from the camera or put like a mask on. I'm not gonna screw you all the way. I went to a panel for God's sake. I was like, oh yeah, I feel like doing it. You went to one of them.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:55.650 --> 0:30:56.292]: 
  I understand.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:06.332 --> 0:31:07.109]: 
  I don't do pi...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:01.800 --> 0:32:01.952]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:09.833 --> 0:32:10.440]: 
  February 11

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:10.440 --> 0:32:10.862]: 
 これを

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:12.752 --> 0:32:13.056]: 
  like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:14.440 --> 0:32:15.284]: 
  Well you went to one of them.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:16.465 --> 0:34:39.261]: 
  I was gonna say so I don't think you're right. No, that's my perspective effort in I don't know if you put yourself out there people like you more for doing it for a reason I don't know that's what I that's either reason I don't like it I'd be there so many fucking parties where someone like it knows you like these snobby Hollywood fucking okay That's a good one. They know you because they don't know you look like that's exactly You look like you know my point Zack saying that you can see the true person if they don't know you are for my point I've been to so many places where I've been a circle people talking and they're like, yeah I was I would do this. I'm just sitting there like I say something You know, they're like look at me look away and after like an hour in conversation Somebody walks. We're like, oh, this is you know, he did this and this and I'm meeting these ass kissers That's why I like it and makes everyone see I want people to see me who for I want to be a regular person Who's treated like a real person? Yeah, I hate the fucking thing of like, oh, you made this you get these leeches these fucking bottom feeders Yeah, I hate that so here's here's an interesting parallel right because I'd be a fucking per you a big interesting parallel is when I was 15 I was very overweight. I was very overweight for them for my entire youth and then I Over a course of a summer I did a lot of unhealthy things and I lost a Stupid amount of weight. I went to the hospital because my immune system basically shut down They fed me intervenously through my knuckle for about a week and a half And I lost a ton of time away and then when I was in the hospital I lost even more weight because I was just being fed like NACL. What is the sodium? They're just being me fucking Gatorade But then when I got out Yeah, because this was the international school. This was in Malaysia. There wasn't a whole lot of people It's a pretty small circle of people Yeah But the exact same people that I remember making fun of me while I was drawing in my sketchbook I had headphones on but I was switching tracks like you know bouncing through tracks So there was a dead space in my tracks I could hear them talking about me like while I was and these were my quote-unquote friends like these were the people but I mean It wasn't friendly banter you were the fact it so I was I was like yeah I was the fact kid of the group I guess so they always needed like a thing I guess But I didn't know that was a case gonna never hurt it to my face. You know, you always kind of felt things so anyways But I got back

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:17.292 --> 0:32:19.047]: 
  A part of YOU.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:22.540 --> 0:32:22.860]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:25.645 --> 0:32:26.590]: 
  effort in

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:29.442 --> 0:32:29.729]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:36.968 --> 0:32:39.634]: 
  Okay, that's a good point.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:40.714 --> 0:32:44.005]: 
  Exactly. Exactly. Because you keep writing what you look like. You know...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:47.093 --> 0:32:49.877]: 
  They don't know who you are first. Yeah, this is my point. I've been to so many places.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:17.215 --> 0:33:17.519]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:19.493 --> 0:33:20.674]: 
  I'll be right back.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:22.328 --> 0:33:22.716]: 
  You would be.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:26.226 --> 0:33:26.715]: 
  I would

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:25.726 --> 0:34:26.301]: 
  He was

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:27.330 --> 0:34:28.225]: 
  I was, I was like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:39.869 --> 0:39:44.192]: 
  and after a number of unhealthy choices, I had lost a lot of weight. And you know, this is when you're 16, so like, you know, 16, 15 period where your puberty is really hitting. So you grow and you change fairly quickly. You got a big dick. I have big dicks of that health. Yeah, okay, wait, let me go. So anyways, what ended up happening was all of them all of a sudden liked me. Yeah. I was a sophomore, I dated a senior, and all of a sudden, like within several groups, I was in a heavy metal band all of a sudden. I was like, I was the lead of a couple of like plays and things that we did. My circle of friends was awesome. I did really like them in retrospect. They were great people. However, there were so many people that I wanted to be my friend that I realized after I'd lost the weight. They wanted to be my friend. I hated everybody. Yeah, I couldn't trust anybody. Then I went to Japan after Malaysia, hated everybody. Anyone who liked me. Well, that too. No, a lot of more international. When I went back to Seattle after that, hated everybody. When I say hate, that's a bad word. I was always suspicious. I could never look at anyone and think, you actually like me. Because of the transition and how quickly it happened, I distrusted everyone. Because I was like, if you saw me two years ago, if you saw me three years ago, you would be fucking making fun of me right now. You would not be my friend. I dated girls, that's what I thought. I went out to parties with people. That's what I thought. I was invited to shit. That's what I thought. I had this disdain for everybody. That's actually a big reason why I'm as nice, quote unquote, as I am. At least I try to be positive and everything is because I spent a huge chunk of my life. Like the most, as far as parties and friends and all that between 15 and 22, that's kind of like a big high school to college party time, where I just looked at everybody with this second eye or this third eye of just disdain. Because my eyes are so small, they only count as half. So you have to combine them to create one. So my second eye. But yeah, so when you were saying that about going to a party and hearing what people think about it. That feeling in your stomach, that fucking fire you feel, when you're like, I know you're disingenuous and you're a fucking snake. That is, I've experienced it several times, where people flattered at me at these parties, or fucking parties where people congregate of like, you know, other quote unquote, E-celebrities, maybe the higher up people than that. And you just get them and it's like, oh, what did you do? You get this snobby fucking dead look in the eyes and you really have to be like, I made this and they're like, oh, oh, oh, immediately these fucking worms. I don't know, it really makes me sick. So that's another reason too. It's like, let's see if you really are. I think it's so much more exciting to like become friends with somebody, like over drinks and stuff. And then while you're talking, then all of a sudden they're like, oh yeah, and I do this thing, you're like, oh, what did you do? And they're like, oh yeah, they drop a name or a project. Like, wait, what? You guys are already hitting it off. That's funny. Look, I've met people who have been like that with, right? Most of you guys have been that. I've met people who have been great, who didn't know who I was. It treated me nicely and then I told them who, you know, we exchanged. Oh, you know, you did this, that's cool. That's good. But I'm saying I've experienced so many times. I seriously, for one instance, where I was flattered ignored in a group of talking. I remember that. Yeah. And they were just like, these snobs, because they were talking about pitching shows. Yeah. And I was like, you know, I did that. So I'll pitch in my two cents. Throw your two cents in. Yeah. And they ignored you while you said it. I think I had more than two cents in this situation, because they hadn't pitched yet. So I was like, oh, this is my experience. And they're like, oh yeah. And then one of the people, the host of the party, walked over and was like, oh yeah, this is Zach. He made a help enters and this and that. And oh, you made it. And I was like, I never felt more dirty than that time. And immediately they all focused. Good day, sirs. While we're on the subject of this question, can I just say one thing? Because I didn't get a chance to earlier. Is you know what I was saying? That if you like, like, you know, you reach a certain point of internet celebrityism where people will come up to you. I didn't mean to say it like it's annoying if you do that. It's just it depends on the situation, I guess. Like, so say John, for instance. I think the interaction is important. So, for example, we saw two guys who stopped over like, hey, can I get a picture with you? And that stuff is fine. But the one guy at the coffee shop, it was the coolest interaction I've ever seen in my life. Guy at the coffee shop, we were leaving. The guy was like, oh, hey, John, I saw your bumper video. Great stuff. And he shook his hand. And he was like, yeah, he was cool. That was it. That guy is fucking cool. And I remember that guy way more than anybody else. Yeah. Because I mean, I would just say this. If you see somebody you look up to, just remember they probably get stopped every day, multiple times a day. And just be conscious of that. Just appreciate that. They're not being they're not being dicks because imagine imagine you're trying to go imagine you imagine all the stress everybody listening has right now in their head. I took a look at the penis bill. I have to go all this co-workers being a dick. I mean, my dad has cancer. Well, imagine you're being stopped constantly. You have to be. It's flat. I didn't expect you to talk about John's dad's cancer. It's one week. Well, no, but seriously. So is that to say it's it's weight doesn't have cancer. Go on. It's not it's not.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:50.702 --> 0:34:51.764]: 
  She got a big dick.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:52.996 --> 0:34:53.639]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:31.709 --> 0:35:32.451]: 
  What's the use?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:32.451 --> 0:35:32.957]: 
  like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:52.431 --> 0:35:54.119]: 
  If you saw three years ago

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:57.291 --> 0:35:58.270]: 
  That's right, that's right.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:32.729 --> 0:36:33.960]: 
  Good luck.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:35.614 --> 0:36:36.104]: 
  is half.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:42.735 --> 0:36:43.562]: 
  That feeling.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:28.669 --> 0:37:32.685]: 
  What? Yeah, exactly. And you guys are already hitting it off. That's funny. Oh, that's funny. That's funny. Look at that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:34.120 --> 0:37:34.896]: 
  With Wro8 You

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:50.640 --> 0:37:52.210]: 
  Yeah, I remember that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:58.690 --> 0:37:58.774]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:59.095 --> 0:38:00.360]: 
  Throw your two cents in.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:00.360 --> 0:38:02.234]: 
  Yeah, I think I heard it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:02.976 --> 0:38:03.094]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:22.585 --> 0:38:22.652]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:33.165 --> 0:38:34.499]: 
  Internet celebrityism.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:34.499 --> 0:38:34.752]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:43.206 --> 0:38:43.223]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:59.474 --> 0:39:00.503]: 
  Yeah, he was cool. Wait, what was this?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:00.503 --> 0:39:01.347]: 
  I was like, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:04.435 --> 0:39:04.620]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:36.295 --> 0:39:37.459]: 
  It was a slick.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:40.716 --> 0:39:41.813]: 
  Cashier war

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:42.994 --> 0:39:44.040]: 
  It's not, it's not.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:44.834 --> 0:41:29.172]: 
  I would say it's pestering, I would just say be conscious of what that person's going with, everything in their head they're dealing with, plus you interacting with them. And it's not to say they're going by you or they don't appreciate it. I didn't mean to say it like that. No, and I think actually what Chris was saying is kind of right though, as far as like, it's not, you know, like as far as like the whole annoying thing, I do think it's not so much annoyance, it's just more about what's a tactful way to approach people. If you want to interact with somebody that you like, it's fine, but if they're eating and you walk up and they have spaghetti in the middle of the night. Or they're taking a piss. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just to be appropriate, I would say. Let's see what they would say. Yeah. I have a situation where somebody's been eating. I think that's not what they should bother somebody. Yeah, that's just fucking bullshit. Eating, don't bother somebody. Yeah. Wait until they pay the bill or something, on the way out and say, hey, I like your work and shake your head, that's it. So you gotta do. Yeah. In New York there is occasionally you'll see celebrities walking around, and that was always kind of my thing too. I was never an autograph guy, but. Yeah. If I ever saw them. If I saw them in the corner and I knew it was them, and they'll make, you know, they're trying not to make eye contact, but as soon as they kind of do, kind of, I'm like, oh shit. So I'd just be like, love your stuff. Yeah, exactly. That's it. In the back of my head, I was like, if anybody in the real country was gonna say, you know, hey, to work. I mean, I've always liked people coming up to me. Yeah, it's always like. It's cool. It's always like. The way it happens that kind of shows what. It's not the act of you approaching it's how that's handled. Yeah. Right. That's all I would say to clarify all of it. Yeah. So. That was a good question. Yes. Yeah. Next, we've got Ben Van Kamp. He asks, I'm very curious about what your answers are going to be. You might have to think about it. What's the worst gift you've ever gotten? Oh my god. I know it off the bat.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:52.394 --> 0:39:52.849]:

  Yeah.

  Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:13.259 --> 0:41:13.461]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:29.796 --> 0:42:13.958]: 
  That's a good question. Oh, actually shit. He said the worst gift you've ever given I want to know what's you both. Let's do both. I'm curious Okay, the worst gift I ever got from my aunt on Christmas Day from my dad's pound shop that he owns It was a one-pound toy from my dad's pound shop. What I don't know six. Oh wait She was working there so she got it for free and they gave it to you even though you probably had all of them If I wanted that I didn't want it because it was like from the pound shop I don't know my dad. Oh, I know the worst gift ever gave I was like seven or eight And I stole my dad six pack out of the fridge Like two months before his birthday. How old are you like seven probably seven? I should have done that. No, no, I saw this. I stole the six pack

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:37.795 --> 0:41:38.487]: 
  Okay, we're skipping.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:45.220 --> 0:41:45.962]: 
  How are you?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:54.906 --> 0:41:55.682]: 
  왜 Creation lizard

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:10.313 --> 0:42:13.334]: 
  the section had done that

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:12.507 --> 0:42:16.928]: 
  I saw the six-pack. Fuck you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:17.181 --> 0:42:25.399]: 
  I saw the six pack and I wrapped it up and like two weeks later I gave it back to him and he was like, oh it's what are you gonna wear this with? You know it was fun, for that point it was fucking bold to eat. I was an idiot.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:26.496 --> 0:42:53.361]: 
  There's a bite that likes beer. I'll just give it his own beer. It's a better gift than that. Of course you'd suspect this fucking 70 year old sub-retainer. Oh my goodness. What was the worst gift you ever got? You know, it sounds like a lie, but I don't think I've really ever gotten a bad gift before. I mean, obviously it's like whenever you go to your to your family's house or something they give you like socks when you're a kid. It's always kind of late, but that's not what everybody gets. I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:55.352 --> 0:43:12.329]: 
  I guess I'll pass. I don't have a good answer. Yeah. Um... hmm... I don't know. No! Alright, fine. We'll just assume that the truth is just so dark that it can't be shown into the light of day. Look, I gave the one A!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:04.482 --> 0:43:04.499]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:13.358 --> 0:43:49.184]: 
  Um, so as far as the worst gift I ever got Um, I don't know if it's the I'm pretty thankful for everything I've gotten. I guess the worst one was Somebody got me when I was a kid. So when I was seven years I I never met my I met my dad once. Yeah, I was a kid when I was seven years old But he left when I was like one years old and I guess I got two worst gifts and they were actually both from him and this isn't like a vindictive thing I actually couldn't give a fuck about him. I I don't know where he is. I don't know what's up with him or anything

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:31.752 --> 0:43:32.072]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:50.297 --> 0:45:36.323]: 
  He's alive? Yeah, oh yeah, he's definitely alive. I'm pretty sure he's alive. He'd be about the same age as my mom. They met in high school, I think, in Taiwan. Yeah, they were a young couple. Anyways, so I got, I was seven years old, and my biological father stopped by. He already had a new daughter, Ashley, who was like just a few years younger than me. We went out, I think we went to Seattle Center. I can't remember the day very well, and he brought his other woman or wife or whatever she was at the time. And when we got back, it was for my birthday, and then when we got back, he gave me a present. And it was trivial pursuit. Now, I don't know if you guys are familiar. Every seven-year-old's dream. First of all, I can barely fucking read. Let alone play trivial pursuit, which was given to me in the early 80s. Now, you gotta remember, trivial pursuit's based on factual information throughout. So, I don't know who the prime minister of the previous Soviet Union is. I don't know who the World Series top batting average guy was in 1964. I bet you he fucking dug through his closet and found that. It was like a regift. Yeah, it was a fucking regift. It's exactly what happened. But there was like, I can barely read. I remember honestly, as far as trivial pursuit, what I did with that mostly was chew on the pieces. Because there was like the little like little pie pieces. I'm pretty sweet. I would chew on the little pie piece things. So, your dad gave you the gift of almost choking. Yeah. I never even thought of it that way. Yeah, and then when I was 11, I got another gift from him, which was a $20 check, which ended up bouncing. Whoa.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:50.331 --> 0:43:51.006]: 
  He's alive.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:03.619 --> 0:45:04.446]: 
  Т.г. Бlessly with bullshit bullshit.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:04.446 --> 0:45:04.800]: 
  Thank you very much.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:06.522 --> 0:45:09.222]: 
  It was a re-gift. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:18.621 --> 0:45:20.207]: 
  Yeah, we have to trust the beat, exactly!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:37.369 --> 0:45:57.704]: 
  What the fuck? Check that alone is a red flag. Yeah, but the fact that it bounced that was here. His character is a check. I know, who's a check too. It was because he knew he didn't have any fucking money. So he did the check just as like a oh I got $20. As far as the worst gift I gave

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:37.724 --> 0:45:38.837]: 
  man bootyz win

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:40.322 --> 0:45:41.115]: 
  Эй, эй, эй!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:43.073 --> 0:45:47.359]: 
  His character is a check. Well, it's the senti-vigil. I know, who's a check too.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:58.851 --> 0:46:30.677]: 
  God I the nut no gift comes to mind is like wow this was a terrible gift Yeah, that's a hard one to answer. Yeah, I'm sure I mean Applies you'd have to go out of your way to yeah Yeah, well, I mean I guess the idea being that you knew that you you couldn't do any better You gave you straight up just didn't do better. You really failed in that department. I can't really think of much I Don't know. I guess the worst gift is like forgetting someone's birthday. I've done that. Yeah What what type of Christmas when I was like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:15.625 --> 0:46:16.435]: 
  Yeah, you gave, you gave

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:31.302 --> 0:48:30.996]: 
  I was old enough, I was 15 or 16. This isn't really, it's a good gift, and a bad gift. My family used to do, they still do these, they used to do Christmases like in the grandmas. So like 20, 30 people or whatever. And I had like 40 or 50 bucks in my, in my, to my name. So I went to the Dollar Tree and I bought everybody a $1 gift. Which is a nice gesture I think. It's also a $1 gift. So nobody, not one person was ever super stoked. It was like 30 people who were very underwhelmed. Oh a spatula, thank you. I actually, while we were talking, I, this wasn't like a birthday gift, but it was a thing I gave someone. Wow, it's honest hour. When I was 14, this is right after I was, right around when I first got to Malaysia, there was a girl, I think her name was Lauren, I don't remember her last name. She lived down the street from me. And I had a really big crush on her. And I don't know what I was thinking, but I ended up taking one of the vases that we had. It wasn't a big one, it was kind of small. And I remember going to her house and telling her that it was my great grandma's. And that I wanted her to have it. Good Lord. And yeah, I mean, not a whole lot happened, obviously. You're up there with the rapist of murderers. I don't know, I just wanted, I wanted to believe I wanted to give her something that I thought she would think was important, but in retrospect, I just think about how cringy and like how awkward it would be. She probably didn't buy you bullshit either. She was the only one who didn't see this before. Yeah, I mean, what did she even do with it? And she just fucking threw the trash. Like, what the fuck? Yeah, no, that was a different time, obviously. Young and stupid. Trying. If I ever get a base from y'all, know where it came from. If I tell you it's from my great grandma, know where it's really from. Fucking target.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:33.884 --> 0:46:33.900]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:41.055 --> 0:46:41.393]: 
  give

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:51.400 --> 0:46:53.948]: 
  Which is a nice gesture I think. It's also a wood dog.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:38.498 --> 0:47:38.835]: 
  Hmm

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:59.490 --> 0:48:00.300]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:06.983 --> 0:48:08.147]: 
  So, all you have to do is play the game.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:12.990 --> 0:48:13.952]: 
  Fuck it through the track

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:22.997 --> 0:48:24.044]: 
  If I'd be the best for you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:27.503 --> 0:48:28.752]: 
  I don't even know where it's really from.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:32.279 --> 0:49:33.484]: 
  Uh, yeah, so that's the worst and best I've done. Alright, so there are a couple more questions we've got here, but I actually... We were talking about this a little bit earlier, and I just wanted to recap a little bit on, um... Your guys' adventure at the zoo. So you guys were talking about the Philadelphia Zoo, and how it's really poo. Not Zach. Chris went to the zoo. I excluded Zach, because Zach is a dickhead. I said, here in the attic, I played with models. You're banned from the zoo after the incident. I went with my parents when they visited. Yeah. So what do you want to know? I want to know why you thought it stunk so much. Like, you were talking about, like, the animals and stuff. Okay, so, uh, backstory. I went to Dublin Zoo when I was 17. Yeah. What did you think of the zoo then? Exactly, right? So I went to Dublin Zoo in Ireland, where usually, I'm sorry to be mean, usually stuff in Ireland is not as good as stuff in America, because there's more people here, and shit gets done faster. I don't know. Everything's more...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:51.263 --> 0:48:53.625]: 
  I did. Not Zag. Chris, Chris went to the zoo.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:55.887 --> 0:48:56.157]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:59.093 --> 0:49:00.544]: 
  Look out at the city from the end.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:01.287 --> 0:49:01.945]: 
  I want my-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:01.776 --> 0:49:03.042]: 
  parents when they visited

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:04.392 --> 0:49:04.459]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:15.681 --> 0:49:16.947]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:30.700 --> 0:49:31.763]: 
  know everything's gonna be fine.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:34.193 --> 0:51:29.753]: 
  What do you call it? Better? I guess. I mean... Diverse. What's technologically advanced? You're saying Irish has... I wish I had fucking flatheads of the antitholic brows, is what you're saying. It's not what I'm saying! I'm saying that... America gets shit first usually, so America's usually ahead a bit. Okay. So when I went to Irish Zoo in Dublin when I was 17, I walked around. I saw... Silverback Gorillas in a fucking 10 foot room. Looking like they were gonna blow their brains out. Second I got a gun. I saw drafts. The monkeys just like staring at you like... You were saying look, no, I'm going... What? If you ever see the view of the gorilla walking on those back legs, it's the scariest fucking thing ever. Yeah, that was me in a suit, but um... We were in Dublin's suit. The gorillas wanted to kill themselves. Everything wanted to kill themselves. I've never seen a more depressing atmosphere in my life. And it didn't help that it was Ireland, so the day was gray. So everything was bad, but I recently talked to my mom and she said that Dublin Zoo is really good now. But anyways... Oh yeah, so she had just gone to Dublin Zoo a few weeks ago. So she was on a zoo kick? Uh, I like it. Yeah, pretty much. She went to Dublin Zoo with my little cousin. They said they had a great time. And then we went to Philadelphia Zoo and it was worse than Dublin Zoo somehow. Did she admit that it was worse? Yeah. So it was fucking tiny. We walked around the entire zoo within like half an hour. Half the animals weren't out, even though it was like the nicest... It wasn't too hot. Were you there the other time there was a dead monkey? Yeah. He fucking fell backwards. A monkey was like a bull, a monkey was like a top of the tree, it was screaming. Yeah, everyone was screaming at it. He was throwing coconuts at all the fucking park people. No, no, no, he had his arms back against the wall on top of it. He was breathing really heavily, looking down. And his eyes were bulged. And then the monkeys were pointing and laughing at him. He fucking jumped. And he fucking splashed. Yeah, you fucking cracked his skull open. His head hung back looking towards the people and his mouth was open. And his flies.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:41.112 --> 0:49:43.137]: 
  You're saying I was-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:46.005 --> 0:49:46.478]: 
  It's not.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:10.997 --> 0:50:12.280]: 
  Hey look, no, I'm going!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:57.977 --> 0:50:58.332]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:06.719 --> 0:51:07.394]: 
  backwards

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:13.654 --> 0:51:14.565]: 
  No, no, no, he was...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:22.935 --> 0:51:23.661]: 
  I just play you!!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:30.951 --> 0:52:44.256]: 
  It was awful. It was horrible, but what I'm saying is, Philadelphia Zoo, half the animals weren't out, their enclosures were even somehow smaller than Dublin Zoo. But I'm not saying Dublin Zoo's bad anymore, I'm saying when I went it was fucking shit. I would say Philadelphia Zoo shit, it's also super expensive when you go in there too. Yeah, it was really expensive, and all the animals that I saw didn't look happy. It's weird, because I've always thought, there's something really fucked up about having the really kind of like, self-aware animals there. Like, you can kind of get everything if there's a stupid fucking lizard walking around, but like, if there's a monkey with a human sad eyes, like, ooh. Yeah, that makes me sick. You're like, oh my god, you know what he's doing? They have like their hands, like their palms on the glass wall. Yeah, they're too smart to be there. They're trying to make contact with you. They're exactly depressed. But you know, it was really fucking weird. Do you remember when we went in there, we saw the orangutan sitting out in the grass? Yes. You know what, do you remember that, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. They looked sad, except they had the biggest enclosure at the time, right? I went back there with my mom and dad, and now there's like ducks there. Oh no! They gave these weird, stupid animals like ducks and fucking like, all these shitty animals, the biggest enclosures, and they gave the big animals the smallest enclosures. It was weird. I think it's, you should be able to have monkeys trapped in a fucking,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:47.708 --> 0:51:48.012]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:59.318 --> 0:51:59.554]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:59.504 --> 0:51:59.689]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:09.224 --> 0:52:11.451]: 
  You're like, oh my god, you know he's in the side?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:11.451 --> 0:52:12.767]: 
  They have like their hands.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:14.657 --> 0:52:19.079]: 
  Yeah, they're trying to make contact with you. They're jackal and depressed.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:38.519 --> 0:52:39.160]: 
  It was weird.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:45.150 --> 0:52:59.039]: 
  So I'm curious about- I'm not the kind of guy who breaks into fucking labs or like- No, I know....this thing skill, but- Zach, tell us the story about your dad looking at the gorilla. Oh yeah, there's a lot of gorilla- You know, you're not supposed to look at gorillas in the eyes, because there's, you know-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:48.981 --> 0:52:50.601]: 
  No, I know. Thanks, Gil.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:58.988 --> 0:53:00.659]: 
  Oh, the challenge. It looks like you're...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:59.865 --> 0:53:21.449]: 
  It looks like yeah, he challenged me. There's a big sign on one of the zoos we went to that said don't grow the eyes And being my dad what does my dad do? He looks at the girls on the eyes. He stares at him Yeah, they're all going there goes whoo-hoo Like that. Like that one. Ooh, look at the eyes of these eyes being like the girl It was one of the scariest things ever the girls were screaming picked up a huge a huge fucking branch through it at the glass

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:07.932 --> 0:53:08.117]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:22.562 --> 0:54:55.999]: 
  My dad never did that again. There was one of the scariest things ever. The look in the grill's eyes was like, oh, he looked like a fucking serial killer. It was the scariest thing ever. Yeah, he did that. I was like, I was like, dad, don't do these. It'll be fine. It's funny. Trust me. I'm curious at this stage where we are, I'm wondering if in the near future we'll have zoos of like hybrid experiment animals. That'd be cool. Because we've already seen, like, you know what? I don't think zoos are too good at it for much longer. I feel like I feel like they're actually. I really don't think they're a good idea. Like, I like the idea of preserving some like an ancient species and shit. But I don't know, something just doesn't seem right. It doesn't feel like it's preserving in some ways, though. Yeah, when you're keeping an animal in a fucking room its entire life, it's kind of fucked up. That's like putting someone on life support. Like, they're not really alive. Yeah, you're just. You're sure they're hard-speeding, but they're just fucking. I mean, if you look at the monkeys, you really see depression. Otherwise, some zoos would ever have big things where the monkeys would just scream and fucking kill them. Gorillas are my favorite animal. And when I see a depressed gorilla, it makes me fucking pissed off. You just have to have like that really positive gorilla in there that's like, Oh, laugh at me. Guys, it's not as bad as you think. Things like, hey, we got food, we got a place to stay, we don't have to be. There's no poachers coming after us. Come on, guys, cheer up. When you see a zookeeper walk into a gorilla enclosure with a big machete, it's sort of hacking off gorillas. That makes me sick, dude. Dude, I saw one of those, I was fucking up. I saw a gorilla smiling, like I started throwing peanuts at him. He's smiling, laughing, clapping. The zookeeper ran with his stick and started beating it in the head. Why? Because he wasn't allowed to smile. The gorilla couldn't smile.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:55.553 --> 0:53:55.992]: 
  reach

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:55.992 --> 0:53:56.346]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:02.455 --> 0:54:03.585]: 
  It doesn't feel like...

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:05.425 --> 0:54:05.492]:

  Yeah, you're just...

  No man!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:34.804 --> 0:54:36.323]: 
  There's no poachers coming out.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:36.964 --> 0:54:37.960]: 
  Guys, see.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:42.516 --> 0:54:45.334]: 
  That makes me sick.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:57.619 --> 0:55:29.682]: 
  He wasn't allowed to smile. Why did he take the peanuts? He threw them to the alligators. Have you ever been to a medium? A medium? Yeah, and they're like, I'm gonna read your hand now. Oh, like palm read your hand? Yeah, one time I saw a medium in a gorilla enclosure, because the gorilla was depressed, and you wanted to know what was going on. She was like, the medium's arm off. She looked at his lifeline on his hand, and she looked at him and his big, real eyes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:22.932 --> 0:55:22.999]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:30.644 --> 0:56:52.724]: 
  She said I see death and he went You fucking grabbed your hand and ripped it off and started with the glass Yeah Why are you girls so funny? Cause you're so close to us Yeah, I think monkeys, oh my god we had this They're just to form people Should we save this for the New York one? But we had Chris and Charlie and I, we had this fucking running joke the whole time We was fucking swaying us Just do it You can always come back to it I think, okay, I think I hit upon one of the funniest things ever Foreign people in distress, foreign accents in horrible distress I was doing it yesterday, I was talking about an Indian man like watching his son be killed in the goat attack I was making myself laugh but like, we were doing this, we were doing this thing where it was like a man from Africa And it was like the whole joke, we did it like over and over Okay so the story is always, this is always the joke, is there's the stressed African man in the jungle recounting a story of a monkey that walks into the village and he recounts how they killed the monkey and why So it's like, one day I had been back to reach a monkey come from the woods and he walked like that I see the monkey, I beat him with his teeth, his brain come out, the monkey never come back

  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:53.500 --> 0:57:15.690]: 
  We kept changing, we were like, we were like, what day I was in that village and monkeys come out. I looked at them, they challenged me. I hang them up like Jesus Christ for all the monkeys to see. The monkeys, the monkeys never come back to that village. Oh my God! I just kept doing... Amazing, Sam! One day I was digging a pit in the village, where I was...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:15.437 --> 0:57:17.007]: 
  What a big fucking monkey!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:17.007 --> 0:58:05.809]: 
  walking from the wall. We see a monkey trying to fly a kite from up above the tree. We throw a sword at the monkey, the monkey come down. Monkey, don't come, we do the village. They flew a monkey right on the kite. Can you tell, can you tell the, wait, can you tell the Jesus story with the Jesse Ventura accent? Oh, I mean, Jesse Ventura's accent is the one. Well, basically, okay, so I was, I was shooting there and a monkey just happened to walk in probably from the Builder Book Group. Those guys were always up to something, trying to steal all guns. And a monkey walked right in and I started beating it with a gun because I'm allowed to have my rights. And the monkey died, of course. Dude, I was showing.

  village with a big fucking monkey. I always imagine this like happy playful monkey just like dancing through the building.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:32.539 --> 0:58:33.822]: 
  I always imagined this like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:35.087 --> 0:58:36.944]: 
  You're just like, dancing through the building.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:40.774 --> 0:59:20.684]:

We just kept doing this shit. We was like, we'll say we'll say John John Show me here again. I'm excited for that. What are we gonna try to get him out here? He's in LA for a couple weeks. We can have a little bit of a day comes back Do you think of a zoo where to host some like human-made hybrid animals that animal rights activists would come out and try Definitely like if they if they were to be like the ender thaws if they

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:56.991 --> 0:59:00.940]: 
  I'll say that for the very first time. John will do the fucking thing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:03.707 --> 0:59:04.787]: 
  What are we gonna try to get him out here?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:16.482 --> 0:59:16.937]: 
 拜拜

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:16.937 --> 0:59:17.224]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:21.460 --> 1:00:08.963]: 
  Then why aren't they fucking protesting shit now at zoos or do they? Yeah, I saw a protest during that at the zoo. Yeah, and if seriously, I don't really protest a lot of that kind of stuff. You know, not a vegetarian or anything of that. Yeah, you know, you know, you know, Colt, he's not good, but I'm not really an activist or anything. But I think zoos are probably not a weird thing. Those are not a good idea, I don't think. I think about like Tumblr and like some of the things that have come up in terms of like, you know, being in social issues. Like I couldn't make my gender rock type or whatever shit like that. Not yet. Not yet. But like all of a sudden, but then like things like zoos, they're like right there in the middle of the city. Yeah. And it's like such- In the heart of the city, these monkeys are a big fucking cement cave. They're like sitting in piles of poop. Yeah. The zookeeper's dropping cinder blocks from 20 feet up on through the cave.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:24.480 --> 0:59:25.004]: 
  Do that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:25.004 --> 0:59:28.227]: 
  I saw a protestor say that at the zoo.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:38.942 --> 0:59:40.292]: 
  He's just gonna weird me out with him.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:52.155 --> 0:59:54.569]: 
  Yeah. Shit like that. Not yet. No, not yet.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:59.985 --> 1:00:00.070]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:11.680 --> 1:01:45.724]: 
  and beating the mistakes. And it's like, it just, I don't know, it just surprises me that these people who have no problem like speaking out about things, I don't know, it just seems like that would be such a much, that's an obvious visual, like, I don't know, in some cases of travesty, when you see these sad animals. I've always thought that the people who are like, who feel really, really oppressed because fictional characters dress the way they don't like them to dress, they feel more oppressed with that. Then like a woman in Afghanistan who leaves the faith and gets killed, they feel way more oppressed, which is baffling to me. And I know it's not like, oh, there can't be different problems to worry about, but if you're worrying about a fictional, the way a fictional character dresses, you don't have any problems anymore. That's it, if you're down to that, if that's the big issue of the day, you're good. You're good, I promise you, you're good. What's interesting to me is like, a lot of those opinions and like how strongly people feel about it, I wonder like in five, six years, when they look back at themselves, do they think like, wow, I was dummy, you know what I mean? Because like- But I feel like some people grow out of it, I think it's a phase, I think that kind of group of people really thrives off the younger people who are like 14, 15, 16, who are really trying to find themselves, maybe try to find their sexuality. No, and I understand how it happens at that phase of your life, absolutely. So I would say maybe, but I feel like maybe that also, maybe people can grow to be adults who end up pushing it forward, I don't know, probably a little bit both. Hopefully, I'll,

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:46.905 --> 1:02:17.297]: 
  a chunk of people grow up, grow out of it, I think, I hope. What's really weird is you see communism is a big thing on Tumblr. They really, I've seen posts of the same people who do the same thing, because they really think communism is like... But that's such a high school thing. It is a high, that is all it is. That was such a like the principle of like, oh yeah, everyone's equal and we all do the same. Exactly. And everyone's like this is pure. But then you wanna shake it and go, you're a fucking idiot. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:05.181 --> 1:02:07.105]: 
  It is a high set, it's always...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:07.898 --> 1:02:09.619]: 
  It is.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:10.530 --> 1:02:12.437]: 
  Exactly

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:18.124 --> 1:04:12.975]: 
  There's not been one scenario where communism- You can't say what. Anything but fucking corruption and death. Not one communist country. I mean, even a place like China is not really communist anymore. It's not. They're really pseudo-communists. They're a lot more capitalist. Yeah, they're communist in just they pretty much at this point. Yeah, pretty much. And I do think at times they use the communism when they need to like- When they need to take arms? Strong or something. Yeah, when they need to make something happen. But for the most part, they've been very good about- Look, if they were truly this quote-unquote communist nation, they would have never lent America money. You know what I mean? That would not be the case. They're not. My point is like, it's that weird phase of like- Yeah. I'm gonna be a communist. There was a point where everyone on fucking Reddit and Tumblr were like, look how cool Vladimir Putin is. He's like riding horses and shit. And then like- Do you remember people were obsessed with him? Yeah, he was the huge man. He was like, he's awesome. And they look all these pictures with him with his shirt off and stuff. Yeah, like he gets people to take of him like fighting bears and shit. It's fucking- It's honestly Hitler level stuff. I'm not doing that because I know that's really like the easy run. I'm not saying he's like Hitler. I'm saying like Hitler never like wanted himself to take pictures with his hands in his pocket. Really really really really cared about his image. A lot of- Most leaders, all leaders do care about that, but Putin was like a different level of propaganda when it's like him with his shirt off, him with a big fish- Yeah, flying a plane, him with bombing bears in the ocean. Karate and so forth. Yeah, seriously. You're gonna blame bombing bears? It's a whole different level. Have you heard about that thing where world leaders want to have- There are basically the camera when they do a handshake. There's really weird levels of that. So that makes sense, but then Putin's on a different level I think. Yeah. Compared to what other people have. So what would you think of Obama in terms of his- What do you think his concerns about public image are?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:21.415 --> 1:02:21.432]: 
  Thank you.

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:41.935 --> 1:02:43.690]: 
  Like, strong something, yeah, with confidence.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:54.254 --> 1:02:56.194]: 
  like that would not be the case.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:03.535 --> 1:03:06.100]: 
  There was like an orchestra where like, you know,

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:06.100 --> 1:03:06.302]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:12.867 --> 1:03:16.613]: 
  Do you remember people were obsessed with it?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:18.132 --> 1:03:18.942]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:24.713]:

  Mm-hmm.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:46.229 --> 1:03:52.050]: 
  Yeah, flying your plane, him and bombing bears. Karate and so forth. Yeah, seriously. He's the plane bomb.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:50.937 --> 1:03:52.455]: 
  You're eating a plain boning bear.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:06.242 --> 1:04:06.529]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:13.650 --> 1:04:59.534]: 
  Cool, baby. Yeah, I think that's about it. I feel like he wants to appeal to the youth and I think honestly He's literally a job with that. He's appeared a lot of talk shows. He's done. He's on Kimmel and stuff He's on you know, he's on he was on between two ferns. He's was on Buzzfeed I think recently. Yeah, every every time it's for the plug to help you I think but he I mean, it's not a good job With that he knows what he's doing. Yeah, as far as that goes I wish he was like doing his job and not like on TV doing all these YouTube videos I Recently I think recently it's in his last I think I think he realizes in the last two years He doesn't really have to win another election. So he's doing a little more stuff. Yeah the Cuba thing I'm glad I cut this up. This is all callous. No, because this is political shit. Don't be what's dear about this I'm glad I'm glad with the Cuba thing. I think he's done good with that Dear Randil for now. It's probably a fall apart though

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:15.996 --> 1:04:16.570]: 
  I feel like

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:27.741 --> 1:04:28.062]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:38.406 --> 1:04:39.014]: 
  I like videos.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:52.514 --> 1:04:52.834]: 
 うん

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:00.209 --> 1:08:10.829]: 
  Yeah, they seemed like they were actually on board, which was a surprise. I think I think his foreign policy stuff. And I think he's he's read some I think he's made some big decisions incorrectly, but he's also made recently. I think he's made some good ones. That's very interesting, Zach. Oh, all right. Said Nick, let's get to another question. I'm just curious. There are a few in here that are there are kind of softballs that I think would be kind of fun to answer. I don't know how you guys are answer this one, though. Who's your favorite superhero? This is a question asked by Caleb. Do you guys have a favorite superhero? Not really. Hmm. Trying to think. Probably just Batman. I'm fucking stereotypical. I like that. Spiderman. You know what? I do like Spiderman a lot. You too. Spiderman. There you go. Do you think so? You know how there's kind of like this hatred for Superman because he's got all the powers. He's like a five year old. I'm kind of part of that. I don't like Superman. But do you think it'll ever come back? Like, do you think it'll ever circle back? They did something really cool with him in that game Injustice where they made him the bad guy and it was the best idea ever. How was he a bad guy? He sees Lois Lane get killed by the Joker and he just fucking loses it and becomes like Hitler of the world and takes over. And then he's like killing off any superheroes that oppose him. And it was a fucking amazing idea. That's great. Because he's overpowered. I think if you do things like that, it's interesting. But it's just like. When you overpower the villain, it's always cool. Yeah. Well, then it makes sense when you need everybody to band against them. Yeah. That's the only time I've ever liked him was in that game because he's a dick. I think that's the most interesting way to go with Superman is that he becomes an asshole or he gets cocky. That's an interesting way to do it. It makes more sense, too. He came from another planet. He comes to Earth. Yeah. And he's fucking invincible to everybody at Earth. Yeah. I never really liked it. Yeah, that is interesting. That he is, as far as villains are concerned, like the fact that he has one weakness. But all the strengths, he is actually set up to be more of a villain. I never even thought of it that way. That'd be a good movie idea to play with. They should honestly make a movie of infamous. Or not just this, not infamous. I don't think any superman movies done that tackle that aspect of it. But that's struggle between them. But then I'm also curious. Spiderman 3 tried to do that. Oh, that movie sucks. Did you ever see those old Superman cartoons? Those are awesome. Where he was in Japan and he was beating up all the Japanese people during World War II. He's throwing tanks around. And there's the big bucktooth Japanese ones. They're like, oh, it's so familiar. They all actually talk like that, too. Yeah, they do. And they have the big buck teeth and the really slanted eyes. But you're talking about Superman as a villain. I'm sure they may have a Japanese version of Superman where it's like super evil American man. Did you ever see the Popeye one? Your sap, Mr. Jap? What? That's a real thing. I swear to God. It's pretty funny. I'm sorry. Mr. Jap. It's like Popeye is like, hey, David, there's no getting his engine back, guys. And they do the same thing. It's like, oh, hello. And they give him a piece of a guy by himself. He's so excited. They fucking look like Nakamura and the head of shit. It's the funniest thing ever. For all the wrong reasons.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:35.984 --> 1:05:36.152]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:42.177 --> 1:05:42.345]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:50.496 --> 1:05:51.880]: 
  He's like a five year old being one.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:52.994 --> 1:05:53.365]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:56.622 --> 1:05:58.107]: 
  over circle back, you know.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:16.669 --> 1:06:18.914]: 
  That's great! Because he's overpowered and not...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:20.550 --> 1:06:21.445]: 
  But it's just like...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:27.368 --> 1:06:27.857]: 
  Ja.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:37.982 --> 1:06:38.455]: 
  It makes more sense.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:43.500 --> 1:06:44.732]: 
  to everybody that hurt.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:46.639 --> 1:06:47.129]: 
  Yeah, there is a...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:57.895 --> 1:06:58.907]: 
  Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:59.987 --> 1:07:00.527]: 
  That'd be a good one.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:01.169 --> 1:07:02.147]: 
  I don't believe you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:18.972 --> 1:07:20.220]: 
  Those are awesome.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:23.595 --> 1:07:24.929]: 
  during World War II.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:26.025 --> 1:07:27.021]: 
  He's like throwing

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:31.476 --> 1:07:31.949]: 
  Bam!

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:47.153 --> 1:07:47.372]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:54.224 --> 1:07:54.645]: 
  I'm sorry.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:54.645 --> 1:07:55.084]: 
  Sorry.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:11.925 --> 1:10:25.204]: 
  World War II propaganda is seriously one of the funniest things because they just didn't give a shit. Yeah, they didn't fucking get her That's wild. That's true. All the there was like, you know, cuz they were you know with Pearl Harbor and everything else It's like, yeah, they're only like culture that point to attack the US. Yeah ever and at that point you better be ready Yeah, yeah, it's interesting though I don't feel like you could ever have that happen nowadays like even if we kind of do it like not on a government We definitely have a personal other like I think like what I'm just a lot of Americans hate Russia's that there's a lot of like Fuck Putin and others that is a lot of like fucking America stuff in Russia. It's really weird Right. I think I read the poll that tensions between the US and Russia between the populations It's the biggest mistrust since like the 80s. It's the Cold War. Sure So that's always weird to be when you see that but do you think of something happen in America now? Like if there was some like major conflict with another country and we made some cartoons or major studio released cartoons Or whatever that straight out did stereotypes It made fun of them that that that would actually get published because I feel like there's so much dissension within the country It would be hard to differentiate between on an individual level and a you know, yeah Oh, it's just a medical because for example 9-11 a lot of like South Park did that episode of Bin Laden That could be perceived as insensitive like 50 years Sure, like cuz he's like, oh, you know, he looks like this or whatever, right? But it made sense of them. Oh, so it'd be weird like oh, there's 50 years people could say oh Comedy Central must have funded that by the government. It's like no even Disney did those fucking propaganda videos. I'm saying talking about yeah Yeah, Disney Warner Brothers. Yeah, yeah, so I mean I Definitely think on an individual level like if the US got attacked again or there's another terrorist attack Or even during 9-11 there were so many people within America that were like, yeah, we deserved it Ah Most people got those people were good. There's some truth to that but not I went to NYU dude It was a very liberal school I had tons of not only students, but we had some teachers who were like well we were kind of asking for guys Really? It was like, you know, so I just feel like nowadays There's so much people wanna I mean it's guised as not compassion but like

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:15.621 --> 1:08:15.638]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:24.885 --> 1:08:25.510]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:27.990 --> 1:08:28.733]: 
  Ja.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:12.270 --> 1:09:14.937]: 
  I feel like there's so much dissension within the country.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:19.763 --> 1:09:19.814]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:43.252]: 
  That's what I'm saying.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:58.997 --> 1:10:00.111]: 
  That's what I mean.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:12.531 --> 1:10:13.020]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:25.845 --> 1:14:57.465]: 
  Empathy I don't know what it's guys dad's but whatever the fuck it is tolerance. Yeah It's guys just tolerance, but it ends up becoming intolerance to the other end of the spectrum It's like okay, it's really weird as a fucking journey liberal myself It's weird to see liberals be so afraid to touch my those at all extremist Okay, they're terrified, but they'll gladly shit on the Christian. Yeah, it's funny Everybody does it. It's like all you fucking stupid Christians believe you're not eight eggs or whatever fuck you whatever Yeah, or what are you stupid to got crucified you faggot? Yeah, it's like nobody We got nobody's gonna touch his so so so Yeah, joking so who's them are need a Anita Sarkeesian's kind of little puppet guy. What's his name? Fucking John McIntosh. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so John McIntosh or whatever his name is and when the French cartoon artist died Oh, don't even yeah, that's a great example. Yeah, I was so so it's like here It was like this time to you know, not just mourn but celebrate the work of this person and Notice right and the fact that he was not gonna be bullied by he was gonna have his own opinions You know, he was gonna speak out about things that if you want if you look at his cartoons They were actually very you know, I think they were fair a lot of the assessments they made Obviously, it's a cartoon. So you're making fun of shit But the fact that his death Then became a Twitter point for them to say. Oh, yeah, what was it? JC Charlie? Yeah, it means white lives matter Yeah, it was like What? Fucking that is that is so liberal. It's like in its own It's like what's weird is they have no problem doing it to everybody else. Yeah, I don't get it Yeah, and this like I said this could be for somebody who is a fucking supplicated asshole evil blows Yeah, it is it goes from like it just boggles logic and it's just so far out there and it's so Transparently just yeah evil I guess I would call that evil That's just that yeah that that's that is taking the death of someone who was making about them Yeah making about them and this is a person who was about free speech This is about person, you know a person who was an artist You'd think from like a liberal standpoint like they're kind of a poster child But no their death now becomes because they weren't someone from Ferguson or something and people were upset about it that And that's also to say that nobody was protesting or marching or caring about all the Ferguson shit That was all over the internet everyone was a part of that Yeah So the idea that it could trick that they could use that as a bullet point to trend to try to equate those in any way Yeah, just just shows how absolutely insane That far side of the spectrum is yeah Anyways, I mean that guy if I can say well, I see that guy also weirdly enough He has really weird communist ideas. I bet he does like he he's he's openly said like you know free free free speech You should free market. It's terrible. He's Wait, so wait what would without free speech then what I think you I think he's so far left He's he's just level which is fine But it's just it's weird to see that I was beyond free speech though basically say say what I like and I've got it Yeah, no that makes it shit. Well, that's actually how he works too because I oh, yeah, because there was a comment made about What was it there was there was something about blood-borne being too violent or something it was like yeah But I guess blood-borne's out, but it's okay cuz games or whatever you wrote And I and then somebody made a comment and I just wrote in a reply all I wrote was I think it's pretty fair to say that That this is clearly a parody account. Yeah instantly blocked. Yeah, it's really blocked They've got weird blockbots set up. Oh, my list. Oh, is there blockbots?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:06.780 --> 1:15:40.497]:

Yeah, you know what he must be started to his again with some of the dance that day yeah that bidee bidee bidee bidee Yeah, dude, I could imagine like after if there are blockbots or whatever that alone when something like that happens right they go They must be like full force blocking there must have been like 30,000 40,000 blocks It's like just like blocking everybody. Yeah, like if you wrote anything that had the word sock in it you were done. Yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:13.159 --> 1:15:13.581]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:41.982 --> 1:17:12.212]: 
  Fucking it's just amazing that these are the people who believe that in some way They don't believe they they they they or at least they appear or at least they say or at least they're putting on the image That they are in some way trying to be harbingers of a better future or of of some kind of cause when the truth is They're little fucking children who have no spines who feel like their opinions are more Important than everyone else and anyone with a differing opinion is a brute and a chromagnum beast Yeah, and and they just can't handle having any kind of actual discussion about it. I would discussion scary Yeah, I would if somebody has a different opinion. I would fucking love to sit down. You know me, dude I'm super civil man. I would love to just have an honest debate. I know exactly how some of these conversations would go I don't know but I kind of know from dealing with other people That seem like them that we could have the most I could go in with the best of intentions Be as patient as possible But if I was honest and asked direct questions that this shit would get so out of hand that there would be red-faced flush Flipping table angry. Yeah, and just be like you just don't get it. You know Fucking a racist. Yeah, like I can sense that from you know, you're a minority. So you actually you have a power of their voices It's funny, but I like they would say you're a self-loathe Asian. Yeah, something like that You could have er though me. I I love my Asian side when I say my totalized races when I go across

What's on this list? Okay, that's exactly what Aaron and Suzie did. Yes. So I showed them the quarry in Wexford, which is. So you showed them a big rock hole, OK? Yeah, we showed them Johnston Castle from the inside. So you showed them an old rock building, OK? Yeah, we showed them the outside of our flat, where you can see people fingering each other in the streets. That actually sounds pretty sweet. It's pretty sweet. Well, that's my mom and dad's dad's play basketball and play cards. All right. That was fun. You didn't take him to the Guinness factory? Oh, we went to Dublin. Went to Phoenix Park. We went on a shitty ghost tour that was horrible. Why was it horrible? Because, OK, this is, wow. Because ghosts ain't real. Never thought, even talked about this. We got on a ghost bus tour, where you get on a spooky bus, right? And this is a big thing to do in Dublin, apparently. Just so you know, I'm sorry, ghost bus tour sounds a little bit like ghost, never mind. I'm going to cut that out. What are you going to say? It sounds like ghost busters.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:01.782 --> 1:19:02.102]: 
  Okay, let's go.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:52.373 --> 1:19:53.200]: 
  Wow

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:08.978 --> 1:20:08.995]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:08.995 --> 1:20:09.450]: 
  say.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:12.893 --> 1:21:35.175]: 
  We're going to the ghost bus store. You're leaving that in! No, I'm cutting it. You're leaving. Cut it. Cut it. Okay, I'll cut it. I'm so bad with these stupid puns. Go on. Okay, I liked it. But, um, okay, so you get on the bus and they're like, we're gonna bring you to all the ghostly parts of Dublin, okay? So you get on the bus and they like furnish it from the inside so it looks like a ghost house on the inside of the bus. Okay. Of a double-decker bus. And they black out the windows and put curtains over it so it's fucking dark inside. Oh. And then this guy came on, he came up onto the bus, the tour guide, and he's like, hello, I'm going to show you around Dublin. And we were like, okay. And then he, okay. How many people were on this tour, by the way? Um, let's say 30. Oh, wow, okay. So, I know. And then, okay, so we get on the bus and they're like, we're gonna bring you around, show you the scariest places in Dublin. And then they drive you around and they park outside of hotels where you like look 50 feet across in the building and you're like, that's where someone died. And you're like, okay. And then you speed off. No, and then it's like, and then they brought us to this shitty graveyard where like a bunch of monks died here. It's like, oh shit. Wait, there's dead people in the graveyard? There's dead people in the graveyard? There's dead people in the fucking... Everywhere. But let's say Chris spilled the beans. Okay. Furnished that thought. There's dead people here. What?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:14.985 --> 1:20:15.998]: 
  No, I'm cutting

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:40.214 --> 1:20:40.585]: 
  So.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:24.814 --> 1:21:27.497]: 
  Wait, wait, there's really people in the back?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:27.497 --> 1:21:28.223]: 
  a bunch of bikes.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:36.998 --> 1:22:55.382]: 
  So what happens? Does that make me look like a serial killer? No. Don't put up. You know, it brought us to a monastery. I found the doppel bag. You found the doppel bag? I turned it up to police. Okay. Good. You know what's gonna happen to you, you fucking monster? Mm-hmm. Chris, Chris, the autopsy showed her trying to resist. I don't know what you did. Listen to me, I don't know what you did. But you're gonna be caught and you're gonna rot in prison, you fucking scumbag. Not if I keep this chainsaw. Turn that off. This is serious. This is to every viewer. I hope you know what the kind of fucking person I live with. Chris, I hope you stay up every night thinking about what you fucking did to ruin that family's life. I did it. So how was the rest of the tour? It was fine. I don't know what it was. It was shit. It's so weird because when I think of Ireland, I do think of castles. I do think of ghosts. My uncle works. I do think of all sorts of spooky-ass Celtic spooks. My uncle works at this really cool castle. He led us into it. I'm pretty sure you saw that too, Zeig. Eddie, don't quit.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:22:48.042 --> 1:22:49.712]: 
  My uncle works at this...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:56.209 --> 1:23:52.352]: 
  But it was because of the castle. Haha, Zack. But the- did you like the castle? Did you like Johnstown? Castle. Yeah, it was alright. See? Do they have the equivalent of London Tower where they have castles with torture chambers? There was a jam of goose in the front yard of the castle. That's the other thing we did. We looked at So Scrabby. What? What? It's like one minute away from where I used to live in town. And what was it? It was an old kind of a castle settlement thing where they had like- They had- Okay, so this lady was doing a tour and she was like, okay, so this is the entrance. When Vikings used to run in here in a bay, they used to get pots of fire and pour them people running in. Were you talking like that excited about it? She was delighted. And right in that door there was these like four tiny holes in the wall with bars in front of her. It was like, this is where they put the bad people.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:01.525 --> 1:23:01.930]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:12.089 --> 1:23:12.359]: 
  Game potatoes.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:14.502 --> 1:23:15.599]: 
  Oh, that's another thing.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:18.484 --> 1:23:19.125]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:20.695 --> 1:23:22.382]: 
  Is that anything you said?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:24.340 --> 1:23:24.947]: 
  And what was it?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:53.365 --> 1:24:25.613]: 
  like this. Arlen is cool. You imagined like the person before her got fired because it was like you're making this sound depressing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We need to be a little more excited. We have tourists here. We don't want people to go kill themselves after this. I remember the highlight of their trip to Arlen was when we went to the castle. It was me, Niles, Aaron, Suzy, and Barry and Jack and Patty. And we brought a football thing and Nile ran up to the football and he tried to kick it at the wall, but he kicked it into his own.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:02.612 --> 1:24:03.962]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:26.997 --> 1:25:30.210]: 
  He kicked the ball in his own face? How did he do that? That was the funniest thing. He's a real life Charlie Brown. That is gonna say it just like Charlie Brown. This is what he was also, was it he was on your Dark Souls stream or something like that? Did he like fucking face plant into the ground? He smashed his brain. That was when we were playing Resident Evil for Chris's channel. Yeah, he almost killed himself. He literally was like he's walking a fucking toddler and he just fell over. Okay, do you remember what Nile, I don't, is this mean to say when Nile was at his fattest? No, he's skinny now. He was 80 pounds. He was in good shape now. He was chunkier, but when he was at his chunkiest, he was adorable when he fucked up things. So when he fell on that floor, that was the funniest thing. Yeah, watching, watching, watching. It was like, it was like, fat people falling over is way funnier than skinny people falling over. Yeah, skinny people falling over, you're just thinking like the Holocaust or something. Simon Pegg's partner. Nick Frost. Yeah, Nick Frost, yeah. So when I saw that beautiful Nile Murray at his fat titties kicking that ball into his own head.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:34.995 --> 1:24:35.552]: 
  look consultation

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:38.185 --> 1:24:38.556]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:42.572 --> 1:24:44.682]: 
  He smashed his brain

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:58.485 --> 1:24:59.194]: 
  now... He was there, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:25:00.662 --> 1:25:01.945]: 
  He was a good shape.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:25:01.945 --> 1:25:02.282]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:25:09.994 --> 1:25:11.580]:

While grabbing its leg, it then pulls me up into the outer stratosphere. Mick grabs the small jewel in his hand. Yes. He's nearing the sun. He throws the jewel. It beats towards the sun with a thriving force, with small chunks breaking off now. Mick wakes up, he's shaking in his bed. His cock is lipped with his dry jizz. I must have passed out. Whoops. He had. There was no conclusion. It's not the end. Mick wakes up again. Oh, no. He wakes up again, except this time, he's standing over Zach's dead body. Who's again? Which is also paked in jizz.

This is when I was very young like three or four I didn't know at the time what I was doing, but I I would always play with Legos on my stomach You know what I mean? So like I'm lying on my stomach and I'm playing I thought you would you build sit on your seat? No, no, no, no, no not on my stomach I may have done that too though. No, I'm lying on my stomach on the floor Yeah, and I was building Legos, but I would always wear like sweatpants before I went to bed And I remember I'd always like kind of like rub my pelvis against the ground You fuck the ground while I was playing with Legos And I realized now that what I was doing was I was at a very even in early age. I was jacking off You were fucking I was like, yeah, I was like whatever And my grandma would always get so mad at me when I did it and I didn't understand why But she'd always be like, ah, you're always like Wriggling around on the ground. But she was doing but I think she knew what I was doing So she was like trying not to be like don't jack off. Yeah, don't jack off. That's really weird. Okay. Wait.

Is it real? Yeah. No, it's real. Okay. It's that it's like the same thing When I was younger, I have a very vivid memory of sitting in my grandmother's kitchen with my uncle My granddad my grandma my mom and my dad And I was playing I was no I was I was rubbing my dick through my pants like like pretty hard Just like rubbing my dick. Yeah, and I just remember everyone in the room saying Chris You have to stop doing that like you have to like yeah, but no one was telling you what you were doing They were just like, oh stop just stop but no, they were like Chris. You're not supposed to be doing that It's like this very dirty behavior. How are you? Fucking three or four. Yeah, but but but I just remember it's been like But I like the way it feels and there's like no Chris. It doesn't matter. You have to stop doing that But I just always just touch my dick in public like constantly. Do you know? No, I Touch my balls a lot with real I realize even just you're kind of realize you're Yeah, you know what though? I went through a phase where I was like really against touching my my junk like in public Yeah, and I don't know if it's just because I don't know what happened But I kind of like stopped caring about like I went through a phase where like I didn't want to do it Like I knew it was wrong and embarrassing, but now it's like if I gotta adjust my shit I'm gonna adjust my shit. How old were you? How old were you when you figured out the waistband trick? Oh, what was your first thing? Yeah, I was not subtle at all until I was like 13 or 14 I used to get erections like in class. Yeah the bell ringer. He was like I have to walk to the next class So I had to do one of two things it took you that long to figure out you could just like Well, you can't flip your dick up into your shirt while you're in class You can't be stealthy. I learned how to do it. My point is The point is there's two things I would do if I had erection I had to walk two different class One I would like try to put books or a bag like in front of me But if that didn't work, too, I would just put both of my hands in my pockets and lift my But then for you because I just look like you had erection is also walking like an idiot It didn't fool one fucking person

 SPEAKER_02 [1:35:52.847 --> 1:36:58.626]: 
  Yeah, no the waistband trick is good the only problem though is like we had I did the waistband trick in high school a long time ago And this is you know in high school. You're raging like your boners are bigger than I ever had. Oh it's really a fucking puff! It's like they hurt. They like it's like purple and it hurts. Yeah, it's like that. Anyways, I just remember I had one one time and I did put it in my waistband and I don't know if the waistband was like almost like a rubber band where it was like pinching it So it wouldn't go down like it just stayed hard for a while through like part of the day. Luckily there's a point where it's like 60% instead of 100 you can kind of push it back down. Yeah, but this was The reason it was staying around like the 80 90 oh my god So then eventually what happened? I do remember this we were in the cafeteria and we were waiting around and A friend came up and he was just like hey, what's up? And it was very casual wasn't like one of those high fives like yeah Like you know like the end of a cartoon or some shit. Yeah, this was straight up just to go Hey, what's up, man? And so I went up to give him a high five. No, it's safe in Malaysia We all have shorts and we have don't say it and we have a sleeve shirts. Oh, no, but I was you know, this is you know I was kind of

 SPEAKER_01 [1:36:02.837 --> 1:36:04.440]: 
  Oh, it's really the fucking puff!

 SPEAKER_00 [1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:08.001]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:36:08.001 --> 1:36:08.710]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:36:29.010 --> 1:36:29.787]: 
  Oh my god.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:36:49.227 --> 1:36:49.311]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:36:52.028 --> 1:36:52.939]: 
  Oh, don't say it.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:36:52.939 --> 1:36:54.897]: 
  And we have short sleeve shirts.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:36:59.267 --> 1:39:38.550]: 
  I was a little bigger at the time, so like everything's a little tight. I just remember going to give him a high five. Oh, don't say it. And I can straight up see the head of my- Cause like when I lifted my arm, my shirt kinda came up a little bit. Yeah. And you can straight up see just like the little head like poking over the fucking thing. Did you see it? Um, no, it wasn't mentioned. But I know- He saw it! No, he totally saw your dick. No, I just remember when I did the high five, cause I wasn't even really looking in his eyes. It was like a really casual like, oh hey what's up. So I was just kinda like looking down on my high five to him and I remember like as soon as that happened my shirt came up and I could see my dick hole just staring right up at me and I was like, oh right! And he never said anything. No one said anything. No one saw anything. Hold on, Percy. No one saw anything. Me, I saw it. The end. That's a huge fruit of life. Or like, or your pants are gonna fall down and the butter's gonna pop out. Yeah. It's fruit of life too. But now that I'm older, I'm like, I wouldn't mind if someone's- You know what I mean? It's like, if you wanna see it, go ahead. Uh, yeah. Do you guys remember when you were younger and uh, you touched the tip of your dick and you'd be like, oh I can't, I can't. It's too much. So you mean like the sensitivity of it? Yeah. Do you remember that? Or is your still like that? Cause mine's sure not anymore. No, mine's definitely not anymore. I can slap it around. I mean it's covered in calluses. I could punch it. It's like abs. I could drop a cinder block onto my tip and blow it up. I think, yeah, you just spend so much time with it, you're so used to it. But I think back then especially, I was getting boners all the time when I was a kid. I remember that. Like it was, I could get a boner doing anything. Watching anything, hearing anything. I still get boners doing anything. Really? If I see like one tit, that's it. No, no, sometimes if I don't jack off for like a day and I'm like on the subway or I'm walking somewhere and I see like a billboard of a girl like I need to jack off and I need to do it and it's just- It's weird like, you know, what switches that off? Yeah, if I- Would you watch- I could sit in my room for four days straight and if I don't see a tit, I'll be like, okay, I'm good. But then in a second, second I see a tit. Wait, do you mean like a bear breast? Yeah. No, if I see a girl like, you know, if I probably do it for a day, I'm like, oh, look at that, I need to jack off. What if Chris got out of the shower and it was really steamy, so it was kind of hard to see and you just saw his butt. You saw my curves. Yeah. Do you think you're gonna- Did you have a hot girl butt? Yeah, he kind of does. I do. I got a big fat ass. Not a big soul. I might feel really conflicted and then want to kill myself for a day and then I just jack off the next day and try to forget it. I was on the school tour in France and in high school, I was walking up the steps and some guy behind me was like, Chris, you've got a nice girl ass. You do kind of have a girl butt. I was like, thanks. Well, then- I didn't want to talk to him anymore. I would neither. Zach, you got a little boy butt. I have a flat ass. I have a white boy ass. You've got a dog ass.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:37:17.999 --> 1:37:20.749]: 
  I know He saw it He totally saw your dick

 SPEAKER_01 [1:37:37.928 --> 1:37:39.919]: 
  No one saw anything. What?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:37:59.612 --> 1:37:59.730]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_00 [1:38:09.619 --> 1:38:12.859]: 
  I mean, he's covered in calluses. I could punch him.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:38:24.368 --> 1:38:25.127]: 
  I do remember that.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:38:29.734 --> 1:38:31.675]: 
  I think this is a good bonus doing anything. Really?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:38:33.835 --> 1:38:35.657]: 
  I'm sorry. No, no, sometimes, sometimes.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:38:45.192 --> 1:38:47.385]: 
  Yeah, if I would you watch I could sit on my

 SPEAKER_01 [1:38:52.313 --> 1:38:54.456]: 
  No, that wasn't exactly it. Wait, do you mean a bit like a big...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:39:01.493 --> 1:39:02.640]: 
  What if this is a- What if this is a-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:39:15.027 --> 1:39:15.465]: 
  That's not a big deal.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:39:29.708 --> 1:39:30.045]: 
  Well then.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:39:37.251 --> 1:39:37.319]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:39:39.884 --> 1:39:47.646]: 
  Like shoulder no, but he's shoulder blades for an his butthole like sticks out stuff like this right now. This is not a joke

 SPEAKER_00 [1:39:40.170 --> 1:39:42.145]: 
  shoulder blades no but cheeks

 SPEAKER_01 [1:39:40.997 --> 1:39:41.436]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:39:42.145 --> 1:39:44.980]: 
  He's buckled, just like, sticks out.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:39:51.359 --> 1:39:57.518]: 
  Let's do baby fingers. We've been doing this for so long and it's been fun but I... Are you going? Are you done?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:39:52.067 --> 1:39:52.675]: 
  games a lot.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:39:58.632 --> 1:40:34.660]: 
  Aw, the poor baby. That's happy. No. Woo! Woo! Have you ever stuck your dick in a vacuum hose? I tried once when I was a kid. Did you really? Yeah. While it was going? Okay, this is what happened. I saw it in the movie. Yeah, that's what I... so everyone's seen it like in a movie or something. I saw it in the movie, I went to put my dick in it, and it didn't feel good to begin with, so I didn't turn it on. I did date a girl very sh... I didn't date her. I hooked up with a girl a long time ago who, uh...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:40:20.856 --> 1:40:21.008]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:40:21.008 --> 1:40:21.548]: 
  something.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:40:35.875 --> 1:45:49.564]: 
  I guess didn't quite understand the principles of a blowjob. Yeah. And, well, it's actually kind of got a little bit of a backstory only because so we were at a party, everyone was hanging out and we ended up hooking up. This is after I lost some weight. The party party. Yeah. Yeah. And she, I farted on her and then she was like, yeah, let's do it. So we went in, we were making out, we were doing, she was like grabbing my stuff and I was, you know, touching her boobs back then touching boobs was such a big deal. Now it's kind of like, I still like him a lot. No, no, they're really pretty and I think they're beautiful. And I, you know, if a girl, but from my experience, so many girls have been like, like if you suck on her tit or something, she's kind of like, eh, like whatever. Like they don't really seem to fucking care at all. Okay. I've had one girl in my life who genuinely didn't care and it really made me sad. No, like if you're stuck on a teddy and the girls doesn't respond, she's like, I don't feel anything. Then it kind of ruins it. I've gotten that more than once. And then eventually I just kind of gave up. I was like, well, I thought I was sucking this because you enjoyed it. Like, you know, it really just ruined my day. Anyway, so we were hooking up and she was grabbing my junk and I was touching her booby and nice dude. Yeah. That's up. And then eventually the pants came off and she did this thing where she was like licking, licking it like from the side. I thought it was very erotic at first where she was like kind of licking the sides of it and then she started blowing on it. Now I don't know if you know this, but if you know literally does that consist of I understand. I understand. So, so essentially I don't know if you guys can imagine this, but when she was licking it, it got very wet. Yeah. But then she blew on it, which made it very cold. It dry probably at some point. Well, it didn't, it didn't go on that long, but I just remember being so cold. Like it was all wet and then she's like, it was like, what? What the hell was she? Um, this was when we were 16. So maybe she, I'm not even trying to be funny, maybe she literally thought it blowed her was consistent blowing on a dick. Well, no, I didn't say anything to her at that point because I didn't want to be like, I mean, look, there was something happening. I didn't want to be like, you're, look, you're an idiot. Yeah. Stop doing that. Do this other thing because the alternative is what? Like, no, stop blowing on it. Like stick the whole thing in your mouth. Like at that point, I don't want to be like, but I was whatever at the time. I was just like, okay, whatever. Something. Yeah. It was something. Yeah. So anyways, I did ask her to stop and then we kind of finished making out and we kind of hooked up a couple of more times after that. And I think she figured it out eventually because that wasn't the case the next time, but I had heard from somebody else that she had asked about it before. Like she had told her friend like, yeah, he did this thing and it was, it was kind of weird. And it didn't seem like he liked it. And then she had explained that the first time she did think that it was sucking a dick, but apparently she sucked it so hard, it was like, apparently. So then that's why she thought she wasn't supposed to do it like that because it was almost like she was trying to suck the thing inside out. Like, you know, like there's, it's not like you're actually like, like a vacuum sucking. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like, yeah, it's not that. So I think that was what she did the first time and it was almost like, like pulling the fucking inside of his dick out through the dick hole. I mean, that didn't happen, but that's what it hurt. So then the next time she did it, she was literally, she was inhaling a dick. I don't even think it was inhaling. I think it was all just mouth suction pump. It sure did. But then the next time she did it was with me, apparently. So she'd just been starting to do it. But I mean, she caught on very quickly. But yeah, when we talk about the vacuum thing, I never stuck it in a vacuum, but my assumption is that that's what it kind of felt like. If you don't have a ton of experience and everyone's different on like how much like friction or how much, you know, tension they want. Like some people I've seen guys that are literally like, you know, tug it, you know, like smack the shit out of it. Can I say, do you ever get the feeling with your little girl if she's so stupefied? I feel like, let me, let me show you how it's done. Do you ever get to get to like, no, no, no, no, let me show you. But the exact same thing goes with girls. You're sitting there with your fingers just kind of like, filling it around and they're like, just chill out. Just sit, sit back. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I just, I'll do it. And it's weird because when girls do it, they always do it just like on the top part. You know what I mean? You're doing it just right at the very tippy top. But whenever you talk about like quote unquote fingering girls, you know, guys are trying to fucking like karate chop the inside. Yeah. Like just like, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. And it's like, well, clearly one feels better than the other. Yeah. So it's like, why would you even just tell me what to do? You finger the top to make her come, you see? Fast. Yeah. But the inside feels better overall. No, you stick your dick there and then you, you can finger the top part. One time I had sex. Yeah. It was good. It was good. That's it. With the gorilla who came into your village, he turned out as a fucking monkey. I hit the monkey with a stick. The monkey screamed. I kept hitting him. His eye come out. I screamed too. I put his dick in his brain. I twist, the monkey fall over. He died. The monkey never got back. And that was the first time Chris had sex. That's how Chris fucked some of his friends. Yeah, just stood in the tree.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:41:07.465 --> 1:41:08.950]: 
  And I was like, you know, there.

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:50:01.845 --> 1:53:32.547]: 
  I feel like it would be a lot more like a war of the worlds where like if we made contact like if they came to earth There would instantaneously be a huge outbreak either for them or for us It would really suck if like there would be a microbe Yeah, that we were carrying that would either wipe them out instantly or wipe us out a good movie would be like if aliens came Like a big warship, but they were peaceful that landed in like Iraq or something Oh god, that's a sweet movie. This comes from Angus T. Jones. All right, Angus. Angus. What do you guys think of my hit show two and a half men? Angus, is this really you? Is it the real I wouldn't be surprised. It's the real Angus T. Jones you guys fuck you Angus You're no fan of us Fuck off. What's the deal with the Big Bang Theory? How is that still a show? I've seen clips of it and it's absolutely the worst fucking thing I've ever seen honestly all it is is its parents Thinking that nerds are stupid and weird because there's a lot of young people that like it I really don't think there is there are but it's also people who it's people who don't understand nerd culture at all Yeah, they're the ones that look I've seen a ton of young people say they love Big Bang Theory nerds They also claim to be self-proclaimed nerds. They're not they want it's them It's them trying to live like vicariously through that show. Yeah, there's like yeah, I'm nerdy so you're not you're really not So yeah, I put all your dissolves like wow look at you. Wow good for you And it is mostly moms who are like my sons like that It's also parents working to feel connected to their kids Really if you wanted to feel connected to your kid kill it go in his room. You suck his dick Tell you what else is a boy gonna want you know this Yeah, that show is honestly one of the worst I've ever seen I just you know And I'm not trying to be like a hater It's just and maybe honestly because I haven't actually sat through a full episode so that that I'm speaking from a very You know sheltered place here But the clips that I see as like highlights like sometimes I'll see him on Twitter or I'll see like something Yeah, there is nothing that is I've ever seen a clip from that show that I was ever like wow That's even remotely funny. No, it's just it. It. I really in fact. It's quite opposite most of the time Yeah, it feels very You see you see the the big big fear without like a laugh track, right? Well, they just kind of cut out those and it's just really really a gun. No, I have well That's any show if you take away the laugh track like the timing gets fucked up I feel it not up But I mean like then you get to really see the jokes and then you then you could like yeah, that's fine We're something like friends or like side phones. Oh, okay. We got the lap track. It's uncomfortable But you can still see how the jokes work a little bit. Yeah, whatever But with that show it's like oh wow, this is actually nothing like the jokes are like I would play Super Mario Bros. There's a lot checking. What what did the ways of they because ever laughs after so There's a laugh track for that show. Yeah, because it doesn't look like it's shot like in front of a live studio audience No, it's not so why the fuck is there a laugh track? Oh, that happens a lot of shows now Yeah, there's a lot of shows like that. Yeah, like what I don't watch a lot of TV There's a lot of shows like I'm pretty like loads of old sitcoms do it I don't friends wasn't shot in front of a live studio. It was it wasn't Friends I thought it was I don't think so friends Seinfeld really I'm Frazier I thought I know I know fresh Prince was because I had that one job Yeah, fresh friends fresh Prince because they that one joke really it was really weird like a fourth wall joke where they Will sort of runs off the stage of runs through the audience. It was really bizarre Yeah, I thought a bunch of those were shot for a live studio. He's very stupid

  Valeu!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:52:59.792 --> 1:53:01.345]: 
  There's a lot of shows now. Yeah, really?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:53:17.579 --> 1:53:17.950]: 
 掰掰

 SPEAKER_01 [1:53:28.497 --> 1:53:31.855]: 
  Yeah, I thought a bunch of those were shot for live studio audience.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:53:33.222 --> 1:54:05.993]: 
  I think that's like a 1980s. But you know what? Even if friends wasn't though, but even if friends wasn't, the way it's shot, looks like it's really fun. They tried to emulate it. Right, but this show, this other one doesn't look like it's... 2.5 minutes too, it's not shot for real. I think it's how I met your mother. Do you ever see the compilation where it's like the laugh track? They repeat the same laugh track? Oh really? Where it's like, they say a joke and you hear one guy going, and then they do it again and again.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:53:35.264 --> 1:53:37.221]: 
  But you know what? Even if it wasn't

 SPEAKER_01 [1:53:40.208 --> 1:53:44.916]: 
  Yeah, it was like you tried to emulate it. Yeah, I tried to get that right but

 SPEAKER_01 [1:53:49.793 --> 1:53:50.569]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:53:57.572 --> 1:53:57.741]: 
  Please.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:53:57.589 --> 1:53:57.606]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:54:02.230 --> 1:54:03.411]: 
  It's a bit... it's a bit... it's a bit...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:54:08.963 --> 1:59:09.962]: 
  Like if he wasn't in the lap track you wouldn't be able to tell. You wouldn't be able to tell. It's fucking fun though. I think what they do is they give a group of people into a studio and just have them laugh and cry and boo and stuff and just use that. Yeah, but I'm saying with this other show, The Big Bang Theory, it's shot like a modern show. They stopped. They stopped. I think live studio eyes are stopping at 8080s. The purpose of a lap track most of the time is to make the viewer feel like he's part of the laugh. It's okay to laugh. It's like if you see stand up in your room compared to if you're in the theater or something, it feels it's a way different feeling because you have other people laughing with you. It's also like watching a comedy with friends or with by yourself. Right. Or if you're like a movie theater, if you want to go that simple, it's usually those experiences are better because you tend to laugh with the audience. I feel like the actual theater like Broadway is a much better example of that kind of infectious. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. You wouldn't clap maybe, but like all of a sudden four other people are clapping over there and then everyone starts clapping. The standing and then the laughing and shit. Yeah. We did it when we saw fucking the... when we saw Crystal and I saw Layme's in New York. Yeah. They had this thing... there was like... at the end of the year, it was like a weird... It was like a standing ovation for like 10 minutes and then the fucking actors came out like the Layme's actors came out and they were like, help us fight AIDS. They were like, what? Yeah. They never do that. They're like, help us fight AIDS. AIDS kills people because it's AIDS. If you buy this AIDS poster, it's like, what the f... it was really weird. Yeah. It really ruined the... the atmosphere was gone. It's a noble cause. No, it was... like I get it. It was just... it was... it was... it was jarring as well. It's the same thing as putting someone at the end of a fucking cashier. It's like they're helping you so you pay them. It's like, just don't do that. I'll donate if I want. Make it a way or some different way. I hate that shit. Yeah. Like I saw Layme's. I wanted to fucking feel like Layme's coming out of it. Not fucking fight AIDS. It is interesting that that's like the last taste you had. Exactly, exactly. It's like you ate this beautiful cake and at the very end there's like fucking penny. Yeah. And you're like sucking on a penny at the end of it. They should have done that before the show, really. Yeah, yeah. That would have been perfect. Yeah. Hey guys, AIDS is bad. Stop AIDS by stop fucking... Join the revolution. Yeah. Viva la... Whatever. And then they go into the show and they kind of... they kind of work it in. Yeah. I can't believe they did that. That's too bad. I'm glad we didn't pay 300 bucks for it. What? Oh, that's true, dude. We bought like 30 whatever dollar tickets and we all sat... we had really like shitty edge seats. Yeah. But like during the intermission... Everyone left. No, no, no. But in the middle of like the best seats in the house for like 300, 400 dollar seats, the top three rows were completely vacant. Yeah. And we were like, huh. Yeah. It was too... it was too like clean cut surgical for that to be like a group of people. Yeah. So we kind of made our way over there and sat down and these two girls walked over like when everybody was coming back from the intermission and they're like, did you buy... did you pay for these seats? And I was like, uh, no? And she was like, okay, that was a lot of good. So they were like, but it was funny. Yeah. So like by the time the intermission was over, like 30 or 20 people had done what we did. Like about three other people were fucking criminals like us. Yeah. And we just decided to... but it was a great show from the intermission onwards. It was a good show before that too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that was a really, you know... Before we fucking moved, there was these fat bitches who wouldn't shut the fuck up. There was these drug girls at a fucking Broadway show. They're like, oh my God, look at that. And there's a part where I was beginning where Val Jean like rips his fucking jacket off. He's just big... Yeah. That stuff and he's a big buff dude. And that girl went, eeeh. She's so kicking her legs. I was like, uh. Yeah. And when I... Oh, like she was like, like she was excited. She was crying pants. Yeah, like she was all juicing up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever was fucking, um, you're lipping her feet up over there. They started doing like conductor gestures. Yeah, they were like, do you have doctors? Can I just... I squealed at them. They seemed like, they seemed like a parody of audience people. Yeah, you paid to go see a Broadway show. Yeah, I ruined it for other people. What I think happened was, because I thought this would happen, that would have been a fucking Broadway show. I think what happened was they bought cheap tickets like we did. Yeah. They did. And then they got excited before they went and got drunk. Yeah. Like some bar or something and then they came and they were too drunk or something. I squealed on the mic. What did you do? I was a dirty little squealer. I ran out, the welder were being complete stupid bitches. Chris, what happened was, it was one of those weird things. Even without Chris saying anything, I didn't know what he did because he got through it. I was like, I think he said you're going to the bathroom. I think he even said that. Yeah. He was going to the bathroom but I didn't see him come back. And while Chris was still gone, one of the guys, the people that I walked over and was like, excuse me, could you please shut the fuck up, thank you. Whatever he said. And they're like, okay. And he just said, he stood up like a good five or ten minutes just watching him. And I remember being really comfortable. But he ended up leaving and Chris came back. Did they go back to their shenanigans? No, they stopped. I was just like, I knew Chris fucking did that. I fucking knew it. And after the show he was like, I schooled that up. And I was like, I fucking knew it. I knew you did it. Well, like I didn't want to sit there and ruin the entire thing. And I was like, Chris, those girls, somebody came over and told me quiet. He was like, really? He was trying to, he was trying to acknowledge you a lot. I was going to tell you, I just wanted to see.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:54:11.612 --> 1:54:12.642]: 
  You wouldn't be able to tell.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:54:18.227 --> 1:54:19.088]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:54:35.879 --> 1:54:36.199]:

  with the audience

 SPEAKER_01 [1:55:03.554 --> 1:55:06.017]: 
  over there then everyone starts clapping.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:55:13.392 --> 1:55:13.695]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:55:38.519 --> 1:55:42.383]: 
  No, it was like I get it. It was just, it was just the same thing. It was jarring as well.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:55:53.250 --> 1:55:53.571]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:55:58.836 --> 1:55:59.444]: 
  Exactly

 SPEAKER_00 [1:55:59.444 --> 1:56:00.304]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:56:06.818 --> 1:56:07.915]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:56:22.208 --> 1:56:23.018]: 
  I can't believe it.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:56:29.093 --> 1:56:30.814]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:59:11.430 --> 1:59:32.153]: 
  I just understood it though. It's true though. Those experiences, you know, for some people they can only afford to go to like, you know, one Broadway show. Man, I wanted to squint, it was like the one show I've ever wanted to see. It's a fucking Broadway show. It's lame-miss. Shut up. Me and Zac have been obsessing over it over like last year, and we were finally gonna see it, and then these stupid fat cunts walk in and ruin it. I honestly hope they DIE!
