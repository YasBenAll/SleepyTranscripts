 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:00.497 --> 0:00:20.494]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:20.494 --> 0:01:04.437]: 
  There's a bunch of guys, there's a bunch of bullshitter. Uh, welcome to the Sleepy Cabin Podcast, aka Sleepycast. Woohoo. Um... Ha ha ha. Woohoo. Okay, so this is, uh, the Sleepy Cabin Podcast, uh, the first episode-ish. We have, uh, more valid podcasts planned for the future, but this time around, we're just gonna sit here and bullshit for like an hour and... Test the waters. Test the waters, as it was, as it were. That's right. Already fucking up here. Uh, it's... Tonight is me talking, Stamper, uh, Johnny Utah Jeff, and Psychic Faggot. Psychic, Psychic trouble. Yeah. Uh, Zach, uh, Zach. AKA, Joey Jurson. Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:00:49.435 --> 0:00:49.941]: 
  That's right.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:51.021 --> 0:00:51.055]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:04.437 --> 0:01:05.550]: 
  Hey, give me more!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:07.778 --> 0:03:00.419]: 
  So, last night we asked Corey. Yes, basket. What, how he would solve the crisis of that rank? And I said, I said he could be any superhero he wanted. And he got greedy. He was, that was unacceptable. He wanted to be two superheroes. Put together. Two put together. So he wanted to be the flash, initially the flash. And the Hulk. He wanted to be something before the Hulk. He wanted to be the girl. Yeah, he wanted to be a... Jubilee, whatever you say. But yeah, it was the other girl. Miss, not, miss, not a mistake. Wait. The one that can walk through walls? No, the one that touches people. The one with the gray hair. The one... Storm. No. The one that's like dating Iceman. Rogue. Rogue, yes. Oh, is it rogue? Yeah, he wanted to be the flash and rogue. And I'm like, why? To take out, to take out muzzle extremists. Flash isn't an axe, man. And then he changed it. And they changed it to say he wanted to be the Hulk. And he would, his solution to get rid of these extremists would be heading children, was to go to Iraq and pound the ground and they'd come up from their holes and he'd be the flash and go and punch through the sky. He'd literally, he hit the ground so hard they'd fly up in the air, everybody. And then with flash powers, he would run to them really fast and then punch them as the Hulk. But he didn't explain how he would... Where does, I thought he said two superheroes. Where does the Hulk come in now? He changed it, he changed it from... Yeah, he changed it, he changed his answer. He could just be the Hulk. The Hulk jumps really high. And he can't be killed, pretty much. He's telling me in the car that the Hulk can only be killed by a black hole. I don't know if that's true. By a black hole? Yeah. That tells you to lie. Yeah. I don't know though, that... He's telling me how much he hated the Hulk and Superman because they're so powerful. Oh, because they're unfairly powerful? He said Superman is stupid because he can only be killed by a supernova. No, he can't. I don't even know where these answers are coming from. I think those books feel like a lie to me.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:12.149 --> 0:01:12.554]: 
  What you have.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:44.497 --> 0:01:45.460]: 
  It was a touchy-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:53.847 --> 0:01:55.128]: 
  Oh, yeah, he wanted to do it. He wanted to do it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:57.120 --> 0:01:58.032]: 
  to take out, to take out.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:12.713 --> 0:02:14.822]: 
  Did the flash go through the sky?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:29.402 --> 0:02:29.470]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:30.465 --> 0:02:31.225]: 
 �iz coşar

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:32.119 --> 0:02:32.136]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:34.634 --> 0:02:35.950]: 
  And you can't be killed.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:40.675 --> 0:02:41.839]: 
  Play a black hole.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:43.814 --> 0:02:43.949]: 
  it

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:45.130 --> 0:02:45.434]: 
  He's tired.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:01.178 --> 0:14:09.563]: 
  Can someone just grab you and drag him into a supernova? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know where you're just to find a black hole. Like, is that really what... He knows about Kryptonite, right? You can walk up to Superman with a pop-hole of Kryptonite and be like, just crumple. According to Cory, Superman cannot die by Kryptonite. It just puts him to sleep. It just puts him to sleep. Oh, it just knocks you asleep. Makes you tired? It's like it's like Nyquil for Superman? Yeah. Rocks and Nyquil. What's... What is... What's a supernova again? It's like when a star explodes. Yeah. Oh, so we'd all die. Yeah, he said... If we got hit by a supernova, we'd all be fucking dead. He basically said, yeah, it has to blow up the Earth too, and then it will kill Superman. So the only way to kill Superman is by killing everybody on Earth. Everything on Earth. But he flies around through space. If the Earth blew up, he would fly around. I was also asking if he went into the center of the sun, could he do that? Could he fly into the sun? Superman? Yeah. I don't know. And I mean, he's pretty much human, right? I've seen him go into space before. It's not like he's breathing up there or anything. No. Or maybe he is. He's not breathing. He can't breathe. There's no oxygen. You never see the impact that that has. Like, can you suffocate Superman? He can't choke him with his hands. No, I mean, suffocate him. Like, just like, take his mouth and no shut. Do his... No, because he opened his mouth and ripped the tape off. So why does he... Does he have lungs? My God, could you just... Does he have lungs if he doesn't need air? I don't know. Maybe his lungs run as if he's different. Like, super air? Yeah, super air. Maybe it's like self-circulating. Maybe it's like an internal system. He produces... He talks. He produces sound through his mouth, so he's using air against his vocal cords. So he has them. He was born with... Maybe his breath is... He can retain his oxygen in his lungs for a long time. Yeah, some of his internals run a lot. If he holds his breath when he goes into space. Oh, and he can only be out there for a minute. Yeah, it was like five minutes of the... Yeah, he's just sort of blue. And he's got like iron lungs, like oil drums, so he can't crumple into space. No, yeah, exactly. When I never be scary, if he... I always thought when I was in space, if he flies too far away from Earth, you just get lost and you can't come back. But he's a GPS. Oh, man. You can't find it. There's no GPS that says Earth over there. No, but it's like, what if he's like a pigeon that has that in his head? You know what I mean? Like, he just knows where Earth is. But if he just wants to go to Mars, and then he can't really... Well, then he's got to get supervision. Yeah, how long does it take to get to Mars again? With like our best, like 30 years or something? No, no. To Mars, it's like three months. I mean, two years actually. I think the fastest crack we have now, the fastest propulsion would be like three months, I think. If you go on the speed... If you go on the fastest speed consistently. It's like seven days. But I think right now it takes like a year or two. Oh, because it's like 15 minutes to... or 15 years to Europa, right? Yeah, it's... That's a hike. Yeah, well, we launched that spacecraft at like 2000... We launched the spacecraft at like 2005 and it's supposed to get to Pluto like next year. That's fucking amazing. They actually know how to get there. Yeah, yeah. And probably get back. And scientists are like, oh, it's a really simple theory. You just boomerang it around a couple of planets and then throw it back for it. Once you fly to like Saturn, break up. You should pay attention to math class. You know, my teachers would always say like, well, you can always see the spacecraft out so far because the signal stops. I said, why don't you say like five and they, you know, there's one or two. Do you mean a chain? Yeah, a chain of spacecraft. Oh, so they communicate with each other in the last guy? Yeah, one way or the other. They're communicating with each other. Why aren't you smart? Yeah, why don't you reach in your back pocket and give NASA the 90 billion dollars that's going to... Quiet. Well, somebody said no, I can do it. Well, somebody, it's like, I know, so instead of sending one billion dollars ship, let's send five. Well, then you could get, you could get signals out and then you could see empty space. Man, the public wouldn't like that. If NASA got up and they were like, okay, guys, okay, hear us out because this is going to sound a little lofty now. But so everything you have so we can put five space, got into space. What if they, what if they were really spoiled like children and everyone's like, no. And then NASA was like, do you want to go to space or not? You want to explore breaking your rules? We like to go right now or never. Zach, would you, would you prefer to have a cyanide? Would you go up to space with a cyanide capsule? Yeah, we just, in case if they went wrong and I had to kill myself so I could maybe, I don't know, if you kind of call it to die in space, I don't think anyone has yet. But if you went up into space with Cory, but there was only, but Cory like lost his and then he's asking for yours. I fucking opened the thing and pushed him out. Is it two questions? Is it true that no one's died in space yet as movies just like tainted my mind? Well, there was a Russian astronaut who was like, who's suit fucking inflated too big and he was freaking out because he couldn't get back in the door. Are you talking about like poetically dying in space, like sitting on the surface of the moon crying or like exploding? No, I don't think anyone's died. The Russian burnt sort of burnt up on the way back down. Yeah, no one's died in space though. People died. I think people have like, Columbia and, what was the other big one? Challenger and Columbia. Yeah, they both fucking burnt up in the atmosphere. I always keep forgetting about Columbia. Challenger didn't get to. I don't know what happened. There was fucking like pieces of writing down a taxes and people were finding like heads and shit. How many people died in there? Probably a dozen. I think the challenger one was worse because there was... No, that was 27 or something. It was big. Way more people were watching that one because there was a teacher. Yeah, there's a school teacher in there. Yeah. Oh, and second, isn't there an easier way to like suicide than cyanide? Doesn't it fucking like... Yeah, like, bolts in the brain would be a little bit faster. You don't want to sit there choking with like a foam pouring out of your mouth. No, pretty sure you have. All right. Big, bad bolt in your brain would do it a lot faster. Dude, that's not a very dignified way to go. The rumor is that Hitler did both. He took the pill and it just for safe measure blew his head off. Well, he's a smart man. Yeah. But I heard that... What do you think the most suicide you could do at once would be? Like, hang yourself and shoot yourself and take a cyanide pill and fall in the building? I think about that way too much. But no, it's... How many suicides it was just to make sure you could... I heard that cyanide is fucking horrible. Or it fucking burns you, like you're in science, right? Yeah, you swallow that shit and it's like one of the worst ways to go. Apparently pretty foolproof. Don't think... Yeah, I guess it's pretty strong. Yeah, I don't think you can get your stomach pumped from that. Look, if we got shit at vet's that could ease puppies and sleep... Well, they do. Have you seen those videos of people like Sweden who drink the shitty water and eat chocolate and fall asleep and die? They listen to like, Beethoven or whatever? No. They eat chocolate. What are you talking about? There's people, there's like these dead doctors and people like this... People decide to die. Like if they have cancer or something and they go to this place, the doctors like, drink this dirty water and they drink it. And then they get the taste of it and they're like, eat chocolate and they just fall asleep. And they poetically listen to whatever music they watch, you know, say the device. It seems like it seems like overdosing on like sleeping pills seems... But no, that never... It's like, it's a really low number of people who die from that. Like only teenagers dramatically go and drink all the Advil, you know what I mean? They're not trying to kill themselves. They're trying to kill themselves. This is a weird... This is like, is this an appropriate topic? We're just like giving... We're giving people... Kids, if you want to kill yourself, put your head up for the train track when the train comes. Oh yeah, no. Lay your head. That'll fucking... Yeah, you're not gonna wake up with your dad crying over your body then. Train is pretty foolproof. Yeah, you lay... Lay, drunk guys do it all the time. Lay... Lay on the train tracks. With your head on firmly on the thing. Do you see what it does to a penny when you put it there? Yeah. I end up on some shitty website where some asshole takes an iPhone picture of your dead body. And voila, it's done. Yeah, I'm not shooting myself in space because no of my luck, I'll be one of those retards where the bullet passes through my head and then I'm just a fucking walking mess with half my head gone. And then you're too afraid to do it again because if you fuck up twice... I think you should definitely lie your neck on the track. Don't jump in front of the train because then body parts fly. Yeah, no, they're... Yeah, they're gonna kill you. Your hand will hit somebody in the head. Yeah, just lay your neck on the rail. Lay your neck firmly. If you're listening. And then it's like, boop, problem's over. You don't want to horrify these innocent people with... Yeah, you always gotta worry about who's gonna find you. Yeah, yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I guess the best thing would be like being incinerated. You just get on a bus and like go to Kentucky or something and do it there. And then by the time your family sees you, some other poor guy that's completely unrelated to your family is already pick you up. I think a good solution is in Japan they have like a suicide forest. They just kind of... Well, yeah, the suicide forest. Yeah, it's like a park. That'd be a good place for if you're a killer, to go there and kill people before they kill themselves. Yeah, we talked about that. Maybe they'd be more lenient on you. You know what I mean? Like you go there and it's gonna kill myself. It's like, now I'm gonna kill you. Yeah, I don't think they investigate people out there. They just sort of just kind of go out there and hang yourself and... I would never jump off a bridge though. It's fucking whatever. It's artistic, but come on. It's not artistic. People like to do the dramatic... You're essentially jumping onto concrete almost. Yeah, but there are people who've survived it. They said the second they fucking fell off they regretted it. Like, they were like, oh... It's not a very foolproof way of going, jumping off the bridge. Because if you do... Because if you hit the water, let's say, worst case scenario, you break all your bones and just drown to death. Yeah, that would say... You have a lot of time to think about what you just did wrong. Especially as you fall. Yeah. I told you guys about my group Goldberg machine. I want to put a canvas on a wall. Oh, blow your head off. Yeah, blow my head off against the canvas. And then somehow I have a string attached to the gun. So when it falls from my hand, it somehow does this whole thing where it mechanically signs my name on the canvas and then dumps my body and then dumps their outback or something. You know what would be really shitty is if you fucked up somehow. Like, if you got a little blood droplet on the canvas. Yeah, that's a big fear. Like, what if your brain... Your head stopped the bullet and it never passed through? Yeah, a lot of people. Then you just look like a jackass. Everyone overestimates how much brain is fucking killer in the back of your head. Yeah, I don't want my skull fragments tearing into the canvas. Paper fucking up. You know what's his name? Do you remember that one guy that shot himself on TV? The... Oh, like the wire. Yeah, you remember when he just put it in his head and he blew the... Like, whatever. The top. But the amount of blood that poured out of his mouth and nose, if you put the canvas on the ground... Yeah, you know what? Just hang yourself like this and when you do it, it'll just go all over the ground. You kind of forget... When I was a kid, I almost imagined like your body is just filled. Like, any... Like, just... You cut somebody open and your blood will pour out, but it's really like... Yeah, it's like blood is in a very... People got so many... And then circulation system, it's like it's very contained, actually. You really have to like break that seal and then it just comes fucking pouring out. People underestimate how bad it is. People got mad at me about a clown video because they're like, why is the fucking hole in the lady's head? Like, it's like a little... It's like a little... At the entrance wound. Yeah, it's also a clown video. Yeah, it's a clown video. I'm not saying you're so adamant that like the bullet hole is realistic in this fucking crazy clown video. Yeah, realistically a bullet hole in someone's forehead would probably... It'd be really small, it'd be really gross and at the entrance point, all the bone around it would be shattered. So it would be like the soft spot on the baby's head that you pushed for fun. What do you think would happen if you shot a baby in the head? Would it be different? If you shot a baby in the head, this little thing would probably just explode everywhere. You think the baby's head would explode? I don't know, let's try. Let's go find a baby and just shoot it in the face. If it probably wouldn't crack, it would just be like... No, it'd be like shooting like an old peach or something. Yeah, it'd be like shooting a Jell-O moldy going.

If it didn't shut the fuck up, would you kill baby stamper God? No, Zach? That's a I'm really trying to think of a reason it's gotta be some reason out there What if a what if a guy handed you a baby and said kill this baby? We're only gonna kill your whole family or I'm gonna kill you Jeff I'd just be like he said fucking strangle the life out of it look at its eyes You can look deep and it's all when you kill it if I had to choose between myself and a baby I think I could just put your head over its face. Yeah, yeah What if it said dad, uh, and you figured out Jeff what if it called you daddy, then I'd be like Why am I holding a doll from the 80s? Pretty hot cliche Actually none of those dolls ever sit down What do they say? They say mama. Oh, yeah, I'd call it a baby. They pissed their little Yeah, and go What a pointless fucking doll have you worked you ever own a cabbage patch kid? No, I own the troll dolls though I did I want a cabbage patch kid. I think yeah, I think you got it out of a fucking like a Either just like you know like when you're kid and then you have like a cousin that just has a box of fucking toys or something And you somehow end up with a lot of toys that aren't yours. Yeah. Yeah, I had one of those creepy fucking things cabbage patch kids are nothing more than like Garbage pail kids without the trash all over them. It's essentially what they are They came I think the guy that the garbage pail kids came second. Yeah, so it's like the garbage pail kids Fash kids with dirt all over yeah, I just mean like that. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, the just a creepy factor Yeah, I was about to get what was the worst trend either of you ever a part of like What was the worst fat that you're ashamed of that you bought into? Jesus, I wouldn't say that. I was ashamed of popples. Oh, yeah I didn't mind popples though popples were cool They're just like they're they're almost like that the Pokemon back in the day Except you could fold them inside out they turn into balls actually pretty cool actually should bring those So yeah, so you have this like stuffed ball and it looks exactly like a soccer ball It's got a seam on the side of it and if you pull it apart fold it outwards like flipping inside out It's like a creature

  What was the worst?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:52.559 --> 0:16:52.947]: 
  If you pull it out.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:57.739 --> 0:31:59.489]: 
  Are they all circular shaped though? No, I don't think so. I think they're just like different ball shapes. I think there's like a football one and stuff like that. It's pretty cool actually. Yeah, it was just a fairly normal. Yeah, when you unfold them. I never liked Teddy Ruxpin though. That's the thing creeped me out. If you think about it, Popples were a really good idea. It's like a unisex toy. It's like a transformer almost where it's like it's two different. Yes. It's actually a really good idea. Yeah. Oh yeah, and Teddy Ruxpin. I remember that. Teddy Ruxpin. That was the one where you could put like the tape in the back of it, right? And he would read you stories and shit. He'd definitely talk. I can't remember what he'd say. There used to be a teddy bear that had like a tape deck built into the back of it. I do remember. Yeah, you could buy different tapes. Yeah, and then it'd be like. He would read you basically. Yeah. Was it like, did the voice match the teddy bear? Like fairy tales and shit. No, I think you just like, it was like a glorified tape player. But yeah, you bought the tape. The tapes were pre-recorded. We just read you a type of story about. Yeah, it's like a little arms and I think it's like his mouth like move up and down as the tape plays. Yeah. It's kind of creepy to imagine that like the parents are in the living room and the kid is in the bedroom with like a mechanical bear that's reading him stories. It's kind of like hollow and sad when you think about it. Have you ever heard that stupid story of, it's one of those horror stories, you know, the hook on that, it's one of those where it's like. And then the killer was in the house. Yeah, it's like this guy gives a little stuffed teddy bear to a kid and puts a radio inside of it and talks to the kid and the kid's like, the teddy bear said I should touch my vagina, mommy. And the mom gets creeped out and the guy tries to capture the kid. Right, because that's her son. That's why she's creeped out. Yeah. Zach, do you have a tickle me Elmo? Oh, I think I, no, I don't think I did. What was that big? Oh shit. It's like a decade ago, maybe a decade ago. I don't think I did. I think mid, what, mid to late 90s maybe? That's probably a little bit before my time, if not right at my time. What was the gayest toy? The thing I was into was Woody. I used to, I had this obsession where I, it was a really weird obsession because it was a little bit pseudo-chloric because I would always get these Woody toys and cut them into pieces because I like to see how they work. Yeah. And my parents always buy me a Woody doll, like a Woody, like a Woody doll or like an action figure or a stuffed toy, like cut it pieces. You were literally that asshole kid in Toy Story. But I wasn't though because I did with other people. Oh, fucking Sid, yeah. I wasn't Sid. You kind of look like him too. I wasn't Sid. I wanted to see how it worked. He took like baby heads and put them on my constructs like. But I did though, I was, I was in that creative, I just cut it pieces like, you know, laughed and I got my parents to buy me a new one. But then I cried because. You were exactly like the kid from Toy Story. He would do that with, in laugh, minus the creativity that came with it. I had to, I had some to tell you, Sid. Yeah. About my identity. Guess who I am. Oh. I've been hiding this for years. I thought you said about my daddy. You said about my identity. Yeah. Okay. And don't see it. Oh, you buzzed. You said? No, I'm Sid. Yeah. Oh. I tricked you for a second though. You thought it was Sid. Do you know what I did as a kid? I would. Did you kill animals, Jeff? No. Put their heads on sticks. Just, just insects. I'd have insect wars. I would, I would. Did you, did you ever get upset after you killed an insect? Do you feel bad about it? Only when I pitted them against each other, I'd throw in like 20 ants and one huge spider into a Tupperware container and then watch them fight. That actually, it's not really a fight though. It's more of like, it's like watching the, the Europeans fight the Indians, Jeff. It was kind of cool. I thought the spider might have a chance, but he never did. He, the ants always. Oh, the ants won? The ants were always the biggest stick heads. What is it? What is a spider gonna do? He's just gonna, he really couldn't do anything. Step on him with his hands? Yeah. You think because he's bigger, he's like a big, why don't you step on him with his hands? But he's, you're looking at this like a Godzilla movie, like the scale is like little people and he's a giant monster. Yeah, yeah, little teddy bears can step on him. It's like a bunch of Africans with machetes or if he's like an elephant or something. It's like, he just doesn't understand. Oh, I guess that's true. You put it that way. Yeah. Yeah, there's really nothing it could do. That's actually painfully accurate. What? Oh, so yeah, I didn't, I don't remember having any embarrassing toys when I was... Oh yeah, back to that. I had, I had sweet toys. I had GI Joes. I had Ninja Turtles. I had... I had GI Joes. I had a, I had like a big box of GI Joes and like, you know that little rubber band that holds the legs and the top, the torsos together? You broke it? Broke it. Some every now and again, like if you twist them, like the rubber bands, they pop. So those are like my dead soldiers. And I like... Oh, have you fucked up on the battlefield? Yeah. But if you work carefully, you could actually swap the legs on a GI Joes if you wanted. Oh yeah. They have a little hook holding them together in the middle. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, yo, yeah, some of my GI Joes had a hook in the middle there. Did you ever take different toys from different franchisees that have interact with each other? Like, did you ever have the Ninja Turtles talk to GI Jo? Most of my toys were He-Man, GI Jo and I had like a Voltron. I had the entire set of the Pirates of Darkwater action figures too and nobody even remembers that fucking show. I remember that show. Harry loves that show because it's like the last like high quality animation Saturday morning cartoon and then they just went to shit after that. Like Animaniacs. Yeah. Horrible shitty animation. Yeah, I don't know. That's a... You shouldn't bust on Animaniacs. I was joking. I said horrible shitty animation. It's really well animated. People love that show. Oh, okay. I was thinking about the weirdest GI Jo I had, which is Sergeant Slaughter. I never really understood why he was a GI Jo. He was just a wrestler. It somehow made us way into GI Jo. Yeah, it's a really loose acceptance for that military service. They're letting wrestlers in to hold guns and be on the battle for it. Yeah, like he's all of a sudden he was a real character in the GI Jo. Like no other wrestler was there. And that was his name as a wrestler? Yeah, he had Sergeant Slaughter. Do you think they put him in just because he was Sergeant? Maybe because he was a Sergeant. He was confirmed? Yeah, I don't know. I never really understood that. Maybe he was in the military first, then became a wrestler, then went back to the military. Did you ever have any toys that you thought were really inappropriate or that you thought were just weird and shouldn't be toys? Like my friend, I remember this very clearly, my friend had a bathtub toy he would play with. That was the Titanic. It was fucking breaking half. I just think it's so weird that like 70 or 80 years before it wasn't going horrible. I think it'll have 9-11 toys. It's a bathtub toy. So you float it around your bathtub and you crash it in your cleaner. He broke it half. But you have to say it's like having a Twin Towers toy that you fucking snap it half in crudble. It's just so weird. The Twin Towers Lego. Yeah, knock it down. Like they say time makes things less offensive. Like have you seen the Titanic slide? Is this real? Yeah. Is it like a flatable slide? Yes, the Titanic. Yes, it's like the boat is half sunk. There's a slide you can take from like the top all the way down. Do you think of Time Travers, Cape Hill? I think we were just big assholes for like 1913. And the funniest thing was this was not really funny, but the first time I saw the Titanic slide it was like right after 9-11. It was like the same, almost the same level of tragedy and here kids are riding it like a fucking having a fun time. People have September 11 slides in 50 years where you can slide out of the windows like we're the jumpers. Maybe, I don't know me. I guess they have to figure out a way to make two buildings and do a ride somehow. You could have little kids dressed as cute little terrorists or businessmen. It could just be like a trampoline that you jump on top of and with every jump it crunches a little bit. That's a good idea actually. No it's not, it's a horrible idea. Let's pet that. Let's pet that. Yeah, I don't know what kids are gonna think in 50 years. Is there anybody alive from the Titanic anymore? No, I think the last person that a couple years ago, when she was just a little baby. Can you think of it like this way, right? It happened in 1911. It means she was a little baby. She was a little baby in the Titanic and they pushed her on the water and she floated to. My time frames are messed up as far as I know. It's that happened not too long ago. Seven, sixteen. But I'm thinking of the movie itself. The movie came out in the 90s. But even then the lady was old as fucking that. Remember the main lady was really old. But that happened in 1911. So figure this is the same year 20 years old. That's pretty good. Oh 1911 really. So say you're 20 years old. You were born in 19 or sorry 18. Here we go 18. Let's see 1901 1891 right? 1891 right? Why are you asking me math problem? I'm the worst person in the world when it comes to math. Jeff what's 1911 but it's 20. It's 1891 right? Oh yeah yeah yeah. Yeah so at the end of the life span I think six or seven days he borned in 19 or 18. I really hope so. Yeah yeah 1961. So most people died in the 60s. Person who was in the Titanic. 60s, 70s, 80s and late the latest. That's why the lady so older than the movie from the 90s. What? 102 years old. What would you have done on the Titanic? Died. Any tragedy I'd be a part of like there's a zombie apocalypse people like to believe. Would you have tried to take a kid's spot? No. Yeah I would have pushed the lady out and got it started. Push that old lady out. I might do all right. I'll be the movie instead of her. I'll be some old man. You'll be the asshole that's floating on the board all by himself. Eating the kids. I would eat the kids the first second I got into the only way. Yeah everyone in the fucking every time there's a fucking like thought of a zombie apocalypse. Everyone's like I'd survive. I'd go to Walmart and it's like no you fucking walk in and say die. You'd be the first person to die. They'd be like I'll just be sitting on top of my garage just shooting zombies. Shoot no, hit no. Have you ever shot a weapon before? Fucking cut a target like from five feet away. Call duty. I can imagine you both you and Chris pushing women into the water to take their spot. I would. Dude I have a coward. I will push everybody out. Stamper would head to like the captain's cabin and just sit there with a beer. Yeah that sounds about right. I'd probably I'd be like I'd be fashioning my own boat on the other side of the ship out of like junk or something. You know I anybody I have no my moral goes away if I'm in danger everyone gets out. We're talking about this too. What situation would you be in? Yeah. Like if you were a walla stamper and there's some asshole with the gun came in would you be the guy would you be the brave guy who jumps to front of people? It saves people's lives. I would get the fuck out. I'm not gonna save anybody. I'm not gonna be hero. I think we've been over this. I really don't see any scenario where I'm diving. In front of anybody. I would either hide from the dude or I try to take him out. I'm not gonna like take a bullet. Yeah but my point is like you see these videos of guys like on live like running and like each shot in the face of the guy. Do the money still. It'd be super hard to tackle somebody with a gun. I'd take a bullet from my sister. I would for you though. Fuck no man. You'd take a bullet for you. I don't fuck you. You think it would be the other way around. I don't because you're a nice guy. It hurts. I'm not gonna take a bullet for anybody dude. I'm not gonna take a bullet for myself. If a dude came in a while with the pistol I would be like take what you need man because he's clearly he's not there for me. He wants money. What if he sees like I would be on his side so fast. I would be like listen cashier open that shit up give him the money right now. So what if he's like listen cashier. It was too slow. He blows her head off. I'd be like wow that was unnecessary bro. And he takes the lead by the heroin is like what's your name. Stamper. Tell me the reason why she let slowly live. Why I shouldn't fucking paint the wall with her brains. What is this a Wesley's night. Yeah it's guys a maniac. He wants power. Stamper. Give me a reason why I shouldn't kill this old lady. Please Stamper. My husband is waiting for me at home with eggs. Why eggs. Stamper please. I'd be like listen old lady. Bam. You lived this fucking life. She's dead Stamper. You killed her. I didn't kill her I was him. You killed her. So he gives you the gun. I would still sleep like a baby because I didn't do shit. I would get my sandwich and I would go home. All right he gives you a gun in your hands and makes you point there with your lady. He has multiple guns or he gives me his only gun. He puts a shotgun to the back of your head so it's like shoot the old lady or you die. So he gives me a gun and then walks around back pulls out a shotgun. Yeah this is shoot the old lady you're fucking dead Stamper. I'd be I'd be like old lady how old are you. And she'd be like 84 this Saturday I'd be like bang. I'd be. Clicks there's no bullets. He's like you would have shot all the lady you're fucking asshole did he leaves. The end. Oh that yeah I'd feel pretty bad. She's like you should be ashamed of yourself you'd try to shoot me in the face. What about you Jeff would you do this to Joyce would you shoot the old lady in the face. I would punch Zach in the mouth for asking stupid questions. This is gonna happen this is gonna happen. Zach was mad because the old lady at Wawa isn't nice to him. Is that really where all this comes from. Yeah it's all this pent up sexual fantasy. She's nice to me. Zach's like why is like I say hi to her. She just. Say hi to her. Oh you're talking about Linda. Is that is that. I always say hi to her. She was. Ehh. Ehh. She pukes her mouth over she sees me. The white the one with the white hair. The old white bitch. Yeah she's like really old. Yeah I see people coming and talk to her all the time and then. Yeah. Do you get a two though right. No I think she liked me at first but then I slipped up and I said something. What did you say. I said because everyone's like hey Linda she's like just a paper today and she's like yeah whatever and then I went up and I was like half drunk and I think she knew that I was that I used to smoke cigarettes you know put my water down or whatever I had and she was like is that it and I was like I'm good for now baby and her face her face just went dead like she did not appreciate me calling her baby. Maybe she doesn't like me because she knows I was associated with you. How do you how do you how does an already pale person get in pale or somehow. She was she wasn't like horrified she she got mad like she was somebody's grandmother. Yeah I think it's weird like there's like there's a guy in front of you a guy behind me. She hasn't been called baby since like 1913. Yeah maybe that's why I did it to make her feel special about herself for once in her sad almost over life. Do you also think we were talking about this too do you think these people work at these places like the Dattles and Wawa and they're because like they're retired they want to do it just come. Me and Jeff used to talk about this there's a dude that used to work at the other Wawa. Oh for people that don't know Wawa is a convenience store it's like 7-11 but better anyways there's a dude that used to work at the other Wawa and we I swear like we used to come up with like scenarios for what this guy did in his every day because he took so much pride in his work and he was like maybe 40 we thought that he was like an engineer or something like an architect. I would say so you think it's like a like an American beauty thing where he just works at the fast food place just cause he's bored. In this case I think he was probably fired from his like aerospace job. Well you think he was fired and just got this job because he let the else do. Or maybe he just needed money but he took like the same amount of precision in care and fucking mopping the floor then it looks like he would at fucking NASA or something. Yeah. He was a really interesting guy. What about people who are like 70 years old or 60 or 70 do you think they're working there because they're entirely got bored or that they actually need to work to live. You need purpose in life or you can fucking die. That's probably why Linda's there right now giving me the shit stare. We are our other favorite employees that that beautiful black man with the dreadlocks. He looked like DJ from Street Fighter or something like that. He was like yeah he had like this big lion's mane of dreadlocks and he was like the most beautiful black man on the face of the planet. He was so fucking handsome. But he didn't look like he was enjoying his job. It looked like he wanted there was definitely something in his life he wanted to do that not not work at Wawa. He wanted to be a supermodel and I would have supported that. I guess. Well actually I don't know. No no he didn't.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:05.384 --> 0:17:08.454]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:52.446 --> 0:28:52.784]: 
  See you later.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:03.482 --> 0:29:04.579]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:24.441 --> 0:29:25.251]: 
  really old.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:59.625 --> 0:30:00.030]: 
  baby

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:02.714 --> 0:30:03.119]: 
  How did it happen?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:11.404 --> 0:30:13.784]: 
  Yeah, everything gets weird, like, there's like, there's like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:54.554 --> 0:30:55.448]: 
  I would say it's a good thing.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:02.265 --> 0:31:02.434]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:15.175 --> 0:31:15.411]: 
  He was

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:36.724 --> 0:31:37.635]: 
  Oh yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:46.512 --> 0:31:46.765]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:56.721 --> 0:31:59.303]: 
  Well actually I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:00.315 --> 0:35:49.377]: 
  He needs to be though. Every time he looked at me I got bashful. I'd feel bad. Every time I asked him to make my turkey sandwich he'd just be grumbling back there. I'm like, I'm sorry you're not on the cover of like Globe magazine. You just make my sandwich. Thank you. Jeff, where do you stand? Where do you stand, Samper? On what? On the amount of cream cheese. On the cream cheese debacle. On not this again. Not the cream cheese again. Cream cheese scandal. Cream cheese gate. Should we just go over this again? Zach specifically asked for extra, extra, extra cream cheese and they gave him extra, extra, extra cream cheese. Here's really how this... And he scraped it off and it got really mad. It is a lie version. That's the truth. I asked for regular amount of cream cheese and they gave me a fucking something that would an ant would say this isn't enough. You... Okay, first of all nobody orders a bagel and says remember I just want a regular amount of... No, people do that. There's a button that says little cream cheese and cream cheese and a lot of cream cheese. I click regular cream cheese and it gives me a fucking a penny worth for a whole bagel. So you did ask for extra cream cheese. I asked for extra cream cheese because for weeks in a row I asked for regular, give me a fucking this much something a mouse would eat and starve. And then I said okay well if I overcompetible give me the right amount and I order way much and they give me way... So my plan backfired. So you're mad that the plant actually... It worked. Everything worked correctly. It didn't work. It didn't work. I was... You thought you were gaming the system and you got what you deserved. So it's just that they did their job right for once in their lives. They finally did something worth... That was a lot of fucking cream cheese. It was a lot. I scraped that with cream cheese on your desk. Some people love that much cream cheese though. I think like a quarter of a solid layer is pretty good. Didn't James do that once? You know what's bullshit? Cream cheese. Did he do that? Yeah. We watched a couple of those. Yeah. What was it about? What was the gist of it? It's like when you go to Dunkin Donuts and like they put way too much cream cheese and you're like who's all this fucking cream cheese for when you squeeze it together? It's like seagull shit coming out of the hole. See I don't mind it though. I'd rather have too much than do a little because with too much you can scrape it off. Yeah. I have a question. It's the same price. You should just get extra extra every time right? Scrape half of it off into a tub in your fridge and in a week you'll have a free tub of cream cheese. Bam. Free idea. What? What's your question? I was just thinking actually that Wawa and Dunkin Donuts are actually in pretty close proximity to each other but who the hell is going to Dunkin Donuts for breakfast when it seems like Wawa would be better anyway? They have more choices too. Do they? It sounds like they advertise with that. They have more choices to bet on their cheaper, their cleaner. They have more donuts. Well actually they do. Oh yeah they do more donuts. Well yeah because they're Dunkin Donuts. Wait I think I'm saying Wawa has better options. Oh. I'm saying you go to Wawa and get a fucking, you get anything. Dunkin Donuts you get a Dunkin and a Donuts. Yeah that's what I'm saying like every morning I see hells in Dunkin. Every morning I see Dunkin Donuts parking lot. Filled with people getting like their one of two breakfast sandwiches when Wawa's right down the street. Most people at Dunkin Donuts for the coffee. I used to get Dunkin Donuts breakfast sandwiches all the time and then they changed their eggs around. Now they have this gross floppy white egg thing. Oh instead of yellow eggs? Instead of like that scrambled thing that they used to put in there and it's fucking gross and hard to eat now. How do you put cheese, egg and sausage on a sandwich and it's still bland? It doesn't, it doesn't make sense. It's pretty, it's pretty basic. It should taste good. Yeah. Those things together. Once they stopped doing it like me and Corey would get one almost every morning and then when they changed it we both stopped going for breakfast. The last time I had one was like four days ago here and Jeff was watching me choke it down with a frown on my face. I had the turkey, if you had it it's like a turkey and like melted cheese that was all right. I had that that was pretty good. Yeah cut it out Zach you're making me hungry. Huh I'll be right back. Okay. Zach. Yes Jeff. Who would win? I would.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:18.895 --> 0:32:20.144]: 
  I'll not do this again.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:33.019 --> 0:32:33.087]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:36.006 --> 0:32:36.597]: 
  There's a lot of...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:49.540 --> 0:32:50.198]: 
  People do that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:59.125 --> 0:33:00.222]: 
  Jep it makes more

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:19.949 --> 0:33:23.864]: 
  I thought you were gaming the system and you got what you deserved.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:30.141 --> 0:33:31.508]: 
  It was a lot of straight problems.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:31.508 --> 0:33:32.554]: 
  in your desk.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:41.464 --> 0:33:41.684]: 
  You know what?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:44.721 --> 0:33:44.738]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:31.498 --> 0:34:32.309]: 
  necesario chairman

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:34.889 --> 0:34:34.940]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:34.940 --> 0:34:35.684]: 
 誓你啊

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:47.867 --> 0:34:51.697]: 
  Every morning I see Duncan. Every morning I see Duncan.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:45.664 --> 0:35:45.681]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:50.895 --> 0:48:12.872]: 
  I would. Question over. I'm just trying to have fun here. Okay. It's not fun. Who would win, Jeff? Hitler? Yeah. Or the Incredible Hulk? Well, yes. Is Hitler and... It's just regular Hitler. Oh, he's not in... Why is everything Hitler with the gamma rays? It's Hitler with his little cute mustache and his little outfit. Why? He killed a lot of Jews. Who else to take on the Hulk? Do you think the Nazis could have created the Hulk? They tried to create... They tried to create eight people. Did you hear about this? Eight people? Yeah, they tried to fuse... They tried to get apes to get birth to people and tried to fuse them together. I'm not making a joke about this. It's an interesting experiment. I would have tried it. If you go on YouTube, I guarantee you'll find it. There's some cheesy history channel documentary and it has terrible CG apes like marching down in the thing and Nazi uniforms. It's really fucking stupid, but it's interesting. I'm kind of glad we segueed into this from Mike. I'm glad I didn't ask Mike question. What was your question going to be? I was curious though. I was going to ask who would win Voltron or Godzilla, but you know what he wants to... No, that's stupid though. That seems... Yeah. It's a silly question. Who would win? Godzilla 2014 versus Voltron 1985. Here's the real question. What? The real question everybody wants to know. Who would win in a fight between Godzilla and Zach's fat ass mom? My mom would push Godzilla over. Is your mom fat? No, she's pretty good. She's jogged every day. Really? I don't give a shit. Fuck you! Who would win? Terminator or Robocop? Yeah. Actually, who do you think would win? Terminator. Exploite. Yeah, probably Terminator. Also, I think the biggest factor in this is motivation. I think Robocop would win if Terminator fucking stabbed his family in the face or something. Because the Terminator doesn't feel pain. He doesn't feel pity or remorse. Listen, listen. And he won't stop until you're dead, man! Stanford, Stanford. What? I think Robocop bumped into the Terminator while he was trying to chase John. Like I'm just a fucking... Yeah, I think Robocop would win. But I think if Terminator was designed to kill Robocop, I think Terminator would win. I think that's the difference is who had the better motivation. Shot Robocop in the eye, he'd be dead. Yeah, but he'd be like the boy who pushed him over. Alright, look. Robocop doesn't have like superhuman fucking amazing strength. Nobody took all like a thousand bullets in that drug warehouse scene. Yeah, but a bunch of dudes cut him apart with a chainsaw in part. But yeah, those guys just held him down. He was like, oh, like goodness. And then he was cut apart. Part two. Yeah. He took so much shit in Terminator 2. Part two is canon, I'm just saying. Terminator 2, in Terminator 2, he took so much shit by the end of it, he was still fine. Terminator 1 versus Robocop 1, those sequels, only those two. Let's say the sequels. Oh, now you're changing the rules. No. This is the same Robocop and the same Terminator. Yeah, the same Robocop, Terminator from Terminator 1. So let's say Terminator 1 was trying to kill Steric Connor. Robocop just got in this fucking way. Yeah. It wasn't his motivation. Who would win? You know what? Only. But let's say Robocop saw Terminator fucking Paul's family's head off, Robocop's family's head off. He would have the motivation to kill Terminator. You're on Robocop's side. This whole argument is biased. No, it is biased. You're basically saying Robocop somehow gets like retard strength when it gets upset. No. I'm saying if he has motivation. Yeah. If Terminator would win, if Terminator's target was Robocop, but I don't think it would. What if the Terminator... Oh, so you're saying that... I'm saying it depends on motivation. Yeah, he would totally lose if he didn't care. Motivation-wise. Yeah, he didn't care about whatever gave him a weight, but I think if Robocop was like good block here and fucking broke his back. Yeah, but the Terminator has the most motivation of all. He really only has one thought to kill. To kill Steric Connor. To terminate. But what's that saying is if that wasn't the case and it was his job to kill Robocop, you would win. But that argument doesn't make any sense because if Jeff is beating my ass and I don't care, of course he's gonna win. If it's vice versa, of course I'm gonna win. Jeff's not a machine though. Jeff's not a Terminator. The Terminator would scan Robocop and just see this stupid, soft human face and just aim his gun at it. Those little beacons would just like zoom into his little baby face. Because they say that Robocop has like a marrow skull. That's just like that fake skin. Are you sure about that? Yeah, it's not like bones. Look, here's exactly what would happen. They try to do that in one of the movies they're really serious. They try to shoot Robocop in the face. Terminator would be walking towards Robocop and then Robocop would be like, freeze, creep. Terminator's not gonna stop. Robocop's gonna keep shooting him and Terminator's still not gonna stop. And Robocop's gonna be like, oh, well this is fucking weird because he's not dying. And then by the time Terminator gets up to Robocop, within 30 seconds, he would have pulled off all his arms and killed him. It's that easy. Who would win? Lattee-Wit-Thousand or Marty McFly? Marty. Dumbass. Drive circles around them. You know what would be interesting? Hear me out. What if the T-1000 held a flux capacitor in one arm and then wrapped himself around Marty, like a suit, almost like a metal suit, and then ran up to 88 miles an hour. Would he time travel? Sorry, go back? Yeah. Seriously, the T-1000 was part of the time car? Yeah, what if he sort of insulated Marty? Like he almost formed around him like a metal suit and then ran as like Marty up to 88 miles an hour. He could do that. I think if the fact that he's metal, I think if he grabbed, he'd just fucking hug the car and go back in time with him, right? Does he need to hug like a car battery too to power the flux capacitor? And also, what's the, is there like a radius around the car that goes back in time? Do bugs get trapped on the windshield? Do they go back in time too? Is there like a force field around the car or is just everything that's inside the car? So like if the T-1000 slated to like the exhaust pipe, would he go back in time? I'd say yes. You think so? I'd say yeah. What if a, what if a, what if a, what if a cat was underneath the car inside the exhaust pipe, would the cat go back in time? Apparently the outside of the car gets really, really cold. He probably wouldn't be able to get up to 80 miles at 88 with the cat and the tailpipe. They sort of, what if it was like hanging on the bottom of the car like that? You remember Back to Future One where it reappeared, it was freezing cold and they just sort of ignored that rule from that on. Oh yeah, they never really did like it. Oh yeah. There was fucking fire over the wheels. It was a really cool effect and then they're just like, yeah, this is too much work. It was like ice cold. It's like, what, what is it hot, Doc? And he's like, no, it's cold. Yeah. Yeah, I always thought that was pretty cool. Because when you're a kid you're like, wow, why is it cold? Where'd he go? Why is it cold? What happened? I bet he went to Alaska. What did he do in Alaska? Who would he even do in Alaska, what do you think? What? The dog probably think he would do in Alaska. I don't know, that's the dumbest question you've probably ever asked, ever in the history of Alaska. You said he was in Alaska, I don't know why he'd go to Alaska. I agree with that, but that's a terrible question. Why did you say Doc Brown goes to Alaska? Because the car was cold, dumbass! Why did you go back to Alaska? He'd go back any time he was to go to fucking Alaska when there's bears? Because Alaska's cold. He'd go back to 1850 and he goes to see the polar bears? Are you done? I'm done. Are we done with this? Who do you think would win the fight if aliens, if you went to Alaska to aliens and ducked the Doc Brown? You think Doc Brown could kill the aliens? He's not really a, like a... If he fucking gouges their eyes out. Like their big black eyes? Yeah, he fucking sticks his thumbs inside of them before they can grab him. You can't do that because when aliens surround your bed, you're paralyzed for some reason. Yeah, he breaks out of it like the Hulk, he comes free and fucking gouges their eyes out. I think Doc Brown is pretty worthless, personally. Without his technology. Yeah. Wait, did he ever have a job before just being a... Yeah, he did. Wasn't he really rich when he quit his job because he had the idea for the flux capacitor that he was taking a shit or something? I don't know. No, he just fell off. He had a huge house. So he hit his head or something? Yeah, but he had a huge fucking house before all that. Yeah. So where do you get all his money from? Yeah, it's like a family thing or something. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. Maybe he's just some entitled shithead that... Maybe he was like a good... Maybe he did throw together some good adventures or something. I think that's what they say he did. He had like the spaghetti helmet that did some good work. Yeah, but it did work. Yeah, but my point is you get the idea that maybe he was a failed... That's true, I don't know. He was a huge failure. Maybe he was a porn star. Well, if he could pull together the DeLorean, I'm sure he put something together. He probably was responsible for inventing like the electric mixer... Toaster or something, yeah. Maybe, yeah, maybe. It does feel like a family thing though. It does feel like maybe he inherited the house and maybe he had rich parents or something. Like Brown Man or something like that? Yeah. He was pretty old though, so maybe he just saved his money and spent it wisely. He wasn't that old when that movie came out. What would you do if your son was going like, Bye dad, I'm gonna go hang out with Doc Brown. And it's just like some old man... Who lives alone with his dog. Yeah. His clocks everywhere. What do you think they met? That's creepy to think about. Yeah, what if you met an old man and you're just like, Hey man, he's like, what do you like? You're like, I like music. And then he builds a 12 foot speaker system for you. Just for you. Yeah, that is very like pampering. That's what you hear on Dr. Phil. Like guys like buying thermal victims. Oh, what's it called? It's like conditioning. Yeah, conditioning and pampering. Yeah, you can use this anytime. Hey, you can use this anytime you want. Yeah, here's a key to my house. Like whatever he wants. I couldn't, like, I didn't think that he built that for Marty. I just thought, when I was a kid, I thought Marty was a dick because he walked into Doc's house and over blew everything and destroyed his property. So wait, go apologize. Is that a different house than the house? The big house? Yeah. It just seems like it. Yeah, he moves to do a way smaller house. Oh, right, right. He sells the house to do that. Oh, that's like a subtle thing. It's like, I guess he worked on the DeLorean for so long he couldn't afford his rent anymore. Oh yeah, like 30 years. His house and the house in like Peewee's play house, Peewee's big adventure are kind of similar in a way. He's kind of got that breakfast like Rube Goldberg machine too, doesn't he? Oh yeah. Am I, am I, it doesn't, but that doesn't work either. I think it's back to the future three, right? No, it opens in one. It's in three, it's in one where, it's not even for human, it's to feed the dog. Do they not have a breakfast thing though in the 1800s where he fucking scribbles the eggs of eggs that the dogs still eat? No, no, no, I think that's like a throwback to the first one to show you that the movies are related. Oh, okay, I see. Cause he had like burning coffee and shit like that, there was it. It was clearly like Doc hasn't been home for a while. Okay. He's clearly like really shitty at what he does. Except for the one thing you have at the time trailer. Yeah, yeah. He just fucking sits at home making things like an electric dog food can opener that feeds his dog that probably took him like two months to build and then he's like, oh, I guess I'm gonna make a time machine now. And then he steals a plutonium from the Iranians or whatever. Yeah. What is it? Is it the Egyptians or the Iranians? Oh my God, yeah, come on. It's Libyans. Libyans, they fucking shit it is us. And then you get, you wonder, like... I think that's probably the one weird, maybe punk. It's just, I watch it like this. Well, where else is he gonna get it? I don't know, from the government, maybe the government comes down with black helicopters. I don't know. I think they met even for such a... Doc and Marty? No, like Doc and the Libyans. I don't know. He goes to the Middle East and they do some bizarre... I like the body of Roy. They give this scientist who's never built a successful thing in his life, plutonium to build a bomb. And he still doesn't build a bomb. If you get that now, the government would have it. Yeah, he'd be on some kind of terrorist list now, Doc Brown would be. Yeah, yeah. And then, for as smart as he is, he like lies to terrorists. Like, don't do that. You can't do that. He lies to terrorists and they know where he lives too. They come with fucking screaming with AK-47s in the air. They even know he hangs out in the mall parking lot every night. Yeah, how'd they find him in the mall parking lot? Did they spy on him or something? Recon. I guess. He's probably like, by the way, you can find me in the mall parking lot. But don't shoot me. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know how Doc and Marty even met to begin. It's a weird breaking bad kind of situation. Maybe he was skateboarding down his street. He was like, get off my lawn. And he's like, you seem kind of cool. Yeah, come on in. You know what's funny? Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. There you go. It was pretty cool. Are we that out of ideas that we have to look at our walls for inspiration? We're going to run out. We have literally three movie posters on the wall. Terminator did that. Back to the future, did that. We got Ghostbusters. Might as well just talk about that now. Let's talk about Ray and Egon and Winston. I have a Winston cast. Winston. Winston. He has to be a Ghostbuster with a bunch of cis white males. Yeah, disgusting. Ew.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:57.612 --> 0:35:58.084]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:02.640 --> 0:36:02.961]:

  So

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:16.444 --> 0:36:18.300]: 
  They tried to create...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:25.945 --> 0:36:27.126]: 
  I'm not making a joke.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:29.961 --> 0:36:30.501]: 
  There was like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:30.501 --> 0:36:30.855]: 
  about it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:42.687 --> 0:43:43.767]: 
  It doesn't work.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:46.433 --> 0:43:48.120]: 
  That's true, I don't know, I don't know. It's a huge failure.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:57.317 --> 0:43:59.089]: 
  It's a poster or something. Maybe, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:59.714 --> 0:44:00.270]:

  Thank you very much.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:36.490 --> 0:47:36.709]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:39.696 --> 0:47:40.270]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:48.927 --> 0:47:49.720]: 
  We have literally

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:06.578 --> 0:48:06.949]: 
  Weird.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:10.594 --> 0:48:11.016]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:13.649 --> 0:56:52.994]: 
  Bunch of white guys busting ghosts? Well, that's not... Bunch of white guys busting white ghosts? Yeah, wow. This is a lot. Yeah, where's all the black ghosts at? Where's the 2014 ghosts? Look, I mean, I've never seen a black ghost in a movie. You never see ghosts from... It's always like a white 50 year old people from the 1805 who walked down with the... Oh. Just... In their dresses? It's like, man, when you're talking about this, why is it they're like a black dude with like baggy pants and a hair as well? He's like a ghost with like a Sean John shirt? Yeah, there's never like anybody with a pink Floyd t-shirt as a ghost walking around. And just to call back for a second, when we were talking about Titanic, and it was a Titanic joke and Ghostbusters too. Yeah. Now, if it ever made like... If it ever went to like Ghostbusters 13, would they have like... Like, oh, the Twin Towers are back and there's a bunch of ghosts running around? Oh yeah, that was really... Well, let's see. Maybe the cut-offs. 8084 minus 1911, 12, 13, so what is that? Like 70 years? Yeah, so if we went to like year 20... 20... If it was like 2070 or 2080... 2070... 2071. 9-11 is officially comedy material for people. What's your cut-off? That's self-proc rules, like 23 years, basically funny aids, becomes funny after 23 years. Yeah, I think it would take a little longer than 23 years. I figured the Titanic just became funny after... After only who was alive during it died for the most part? Essentially, yeah, because then you're not hurting feelings anymore. It's a sinking ship, just inherently funny. Is that funnier than just funny folks or something? What is the most fucked up thing that you legitimately find funny? That's hard, like you mean that I think is inherently funny? Yeah, for me it's people getting stoned to death. I'm horrified by that. Because it's like you're sitting in the middle of this ring, nobody else agrees with me, but you're sitting in this middle of this group of people, and there's other more effective ways to kill you, right? But they're just finding whatever rocks they can, they're trying to find good rocks, and they just hit you with rocks, and there's kids and they throw really weak rocks. Alright, I'll say somebody getting pulled into a wood chipper is kind of funny to me. That's horrible. That is just horrible. I mean, come on now. Face first or feet first? Face first is the only way to go. I haven't had this joke in one of my cartoons, like if you get ran over by a tank, it would put me more fucked up going like, feet first or head first. I'd rather do it first. If you went feet first, you'd hear him screaming all the way to the head. I saw this video, this is not funny, I think this is probably the funny... Did you guys watch Vegemothers? I've seen a couple of them. In that episode, it's like Season 1, it's really early one, there's Season 2, and there's like, basically, the whole joke is like the whole episode is just screaming and pain, and some ghosts, they put him to rest, but there's a video I saw of this dude who lit himself on fire, and then regretted it, and he's fucking screaming just like that, and he's screaming right down the hallway on fire. And it's not funny, but I laughed at it, because it reminded me of that. But it was in a cartoon, but it wasn't meant to be funny. No, well the cartoon was supposed to be funny, but in real life, a guy lit himself on fire and regretted it, and he was screaming down and running on fire. All like, in Buddhist style, tried to look. Yeah, but he was like, oh shit, no, I don't want it. I don't think anything to do with fire is funny to me. I think people with big tuber people, with big fucking... We were talking about the Harlequin fetus, it's pretty funny, Jelly Bean eyes, you were saying? Alright, guilty is charged. You like the Jelly Bean eyes. I did find the Harlequin syndrome funny. Jelly Bean eyes. It's the funniest thing I've ever heard all week. I still remember somebody made that arcade stick design, where like, the buttons were like, oh no, I made that, nevermind. I made an arcade stick design, where like, the two red buttons in the middle were like the Harlequin eyes. People had the dumbest fucking arcade stick designs. I actually heard that when you light yourself on fire, that your pain receptors cut off faster than you think, because you're burning through your nerve endings. I think probably the screaming would be also psychological, because you're watching your fucking skin melt and see, you're feeling your eyes... Well, not if you're sitting like a Buddhist with your eyes closed, praying. I would die. I would say that your brain's melt out of your nose, so like... And then something about inhaling nothing but smoke while you're sitting there. Oh, that sounds horrible. It's probably going to get you faster than you think too. I would let Egyptians pull my brain out of my nose with fish hooks before I allowed that. I would not. What do you think the worst way to die would be, that you would like regret? Well, I don't think I'd be around to regret it. But what's the worst thing that you'd be afraid of encountering that would be horrible to you? You know what? Probably something simple. If I was floating around in the middle of the ocean and there's a fucking shark, you just see him and the whole time you're waiting for him, because he's always coming for you and he's just fucking with you. He's just swimming around in circles. Taking bites off too. Like yeah, taking little love bites off your feet and stuff, and you know you're fucked because you're in the middle of the damn ocean. And then the question's like, well, do I stick my head under and hope he bites it off, or do I wait to fucking eat me in half? Do I do that thing where I punch him in the face and stab his eyes out, and why so his friends can come and take revenge? And also if you bite your leg off, you're sitting there screaming, and you're just kind of waiting, and what if he bites it and goes there, and I don't like it, and he goes away, now you're bleeding out in the fucking ocean. And you don't know what else is going to happen. Why is he going to bite me and go, yeah, that is great. What if you were out on a safari and all of a sudden a hungry lion saw you, and there was one big rock in the middle of nowhere, and it was just you on one side and him on the other, and it's just this scheme of trying to stay on the other side of the rock from this fucking hungry lion, and this just went on for hours and hours and hours. I would scream, I'd go like a fucking crazy, and I'd scream, and hopefully he's like, yeah, I don't want to deal with this guy. Oh, you'd open your shirt up and say, he's not not fine, you're not happy with that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And he would just stare at me and fucking kill me anyways, but I would give it a try. I'd lift my shirt up and he'd see my gross titties, and he'd be like, and run away. He'd get a big wrench and choke through them. You like this lion? You like it? He'd get so jealous that he would just like it. He'd look at his own dick and cover his legs up in his local eyes. He'd just cock to the side and he'd just look at any one. Yeah, he'd just come... I'll tell you, the worst death would be if you go to Mexico or go to some part of Iraq and be headed by these... Oh, that'd be the worst way to die, I think. Well, they don't just chop your head off, they sit and saw it, and it's fucking gross. Yeah, sometimes too, they cut only the throat, so your spine's still attached to your skull, like the caudges. Or they give a knife to like a 10-year-old, and they're like, and then they struggle. Oh, yeah, I saw a video of that, and he was like, I can't cut it, daddy. He was like, like, dad, you just started to cut the steak. He's coming there teaching you so that I use the dope blade to fuck me. Change the conversation. There's two videos. There's two brands of videos that I refuse to watch. I don't care if there's a prize at the end for a billion dollars. I don't watch beheading videos, and I don't watch videos where animals are being viewed. Animals, I don't watch. I don't. I can't watch animals. Let's... Why don't we discuss the most disturbing video you ever sent me? Okay. Do you know which one it was? Do you want the Goldfish? Yes! The Goldfish video. What's the Goldfish video? I barely remember that video. And fish don't count as animals. Oh my God. What's the Goldfish video? I'll see if I can recall. No, don't. Oh, yeah, I was... They never can fill in any gaps. So basically, it was just weird, almost like a weird porno in a way, but this woman... I don't think anyone was fucking, though. Yeah, it was just more like a sexual atmosphere. This woman's wearing like a lycra or spandex suit, and I think there were two phases. One was she was dumping live Goldfish into her suit, and people were slowly... This dude was like taking his time, slowly pinching the Goldfish to death through the suit. Like they were all pressed up against her suit. Yeah, you can see him wiggling. And he just slowly crushed them with his fingers, like one by one. And then for some reason, they threw a bunch of them in a food processor alive, blended them up, and then dumped all that into her suit, too. She like blended it really slow. She kept tapping the button. Like really, yeah, like... Yeah, that video was fucking weird, and I can't find it. Yeah, I can't find it. Now that I want to. Every year, I do like a five-minute Google search, see if I can find it, and I can't. I'm kind of glad, though. It's like a relief. I'm like, alright, I can't find it. Do you type in what happens? Do you type in Guy Pitches Goldfish and Spandex suit? Yes, I type every... Yeah, like Spandex suit, pinched Goldfish food processor, nothing ever comes up. You say blender. Blender. Maybe that's it. Maybe it's a latex bodysuit. Maybe because it's a Japanese video. Crazy Japanese people. Guy Gene words. Dude, it's probably some weird language, some un-English language, the worst kinds. You're going to tuck yourself out with the racist jokes. I didn't do it too many times, like you said. Somebody's going to like, when we're up to like episode 50, somebody's going to go back and cut out every Hitler Line's access. It's going to be like three hours long. I only brought up Hitler once, so I asked if we could fight the Hulk. I think it's a pretty reasonable question. Episode three, we're going to have a dead spot, and it's going to be like, who would win in a battle between Hitler and... Superman. Superman. Everyone's going to be like, what is Zack's problem?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:18.863 --> 0:48:18.981]: 
  Wow.

  I think

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:31.729 --> 0:49:33.062]: 
  Essentially, yeah, because then you're

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:37.872 --> 0:49:39.525]: 
  I guess this could have been something

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:49.431 --> 0:49:50.747]: 
  I'm horrified by that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:06.357 --> 0:50:07.724]:

Any wacky story? We should save that one for another day. That's a good idea. Yeah. That's a good idea. Because we all go to, you know. All I remember is it's like completely actually unrelated to the company. It's just more like I was saying to Zach earlier, like the letter you wrote to the text. To the like the inshore. The 401K guy. Oh yeah. You say his family should die.

  Yeah, that's pretty funny in a fire, in a car, in a fire. Alive, you should burn to death alive. Yeah. I think there's a clip in there too. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:40.328 --> 0:57:40.446]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:40.446 --> 0:57:40.699]: 
  Oh, look.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:42.404 --> 0:57:42.589]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:47.365 --> 0:59:46.148]: 
  And then he wrote Tom really upset about it. You said he couldn't sleep for one night or something. You said he was like, I think he accused Amber of needing some kind of psychological help or something. Yeah, he said something like. Well, because you weren't paying fucking attention in the meeting, you didn't remember giving him your fucking email. And you thought he was just spamming you. No, see nobody believes me. I knew who he was. When he sent me, he kept saying, if you think that I didn't know who he was and that assumes that I respond to every spam message I get from everybody. So you were incompetent, you're just a really mean person. I guess you could say that. I don't like that guy. I think he's a fucking asshole. Why'd you give him your email? Because it was the first thing we had to fill out. And I was like, I was really. You could tick those so they don't show up. They could go straight to the field. And I was really psyched to get the whole 401k thing started. And then I just felt like an idiot the whole fucking time. And I wasn't getting any help from that fucking words that I can't say right now. Wow. What words? Yeah, he said something like, yeah, I think somebody on your staff is unstable or something like that. And I still don't have a fucking 401k. I'm not gonna get one now. I'll tell you why it's so fucking awkward. It's because my parents used the guy for some of their finances. And it's like, I'm afraid to ever see him look at him, say new grounds, say, you know, I'm afraid like he's gonna be like, oh shit, you're the parents of, one of those guys. I'll go kill myself now. We talked a lot about suicide and death so far. Yeah. This is a pretty bleak podcast. Everyone's gonna be psyched like, oh wow, I wonder what they're talking about. Yeah, suicide, catch you in the corner. But they fall asleep, they gotta listen to this. Yeah. Hitler, Poppoles, that's kind of cool. Transformers, the Hulk. Harlequin syndrome. Harlequin fetus, gulping being killed. You have to have like a positive, something positive to wrap it all up with. Fuck this, yo.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:09.134 --> 0:58:09.420]: 
  No!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:21.722 --> 0:58:22.448]: 
  We touch it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:33.383 --> 0:58:33.957]: 
  And I was like,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:37.484 --> 0:58:37.922]: 
  That was really...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:58.037 --> 0:58:58.442]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:58.442 --> 0:58:59.219]: 
  I'll tell you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:12.854 --> 0:59:13.799]: 
  Is that good?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:26.792 --> 0:59:29.897]: 
  Death, suicide, catch your breath, being closed to the face.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:46.789 --> 1:00:56.871]: 
  Yeah, Zach, how do we end this on a positive note? Hey, let me do it. I'll answer for Zach. Uh, what was Hitler's favorite pizza toppings? Uh, Jew. Don't say. Dead Jews. The ashes of millions of Jews. Uh, I don't know. You can't be fit the ashes of millions of Jews on a pizza. I guarantee you fucking Hitler would have like all of those pizza. Probably. Yeah, he's a good olive guy. Maybe he was just a vegetarian. I think he was, though, actually. I don't think he would have liked Jew meat. Right? Is that offensive to say Jew meat? Jew meat? No, that's whatever it says. Sounds like a username. That's a common. Jew meat, oh, one, because like Jew meat was taken. I don't know. I don't know how it worked exactly, but the Nazis hated everybody who wasn't or no. Like, I guess. I mean, they specifically, like Jews were definitely at scapegoats, but yeah, like gays and cripples and. Well, no, like, did they hate Italians, for example? Everybody hates Italians. Well, like, what Hitler eat pizza is what I'm saying. Yeah, what do you mean? Like, do you think he wouldn't eat pizza because he doesn't like Italians? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:58.230 --> 0:59:58.247]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:04.170 --> 1:00:05.959]: 
  You can't defeat the ashes of millions of Jews.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:14.920 --> 1:00:15.730]: 
  I think he, I think he's...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:16.557 --> 1:00:16.742]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:22.075 --> 1:00:24.505]: 
  No, that's whatever it says. Sounds like a username. That's a column.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:24.505 --> 1:00:25.112]: 
  You're beautiful.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:37.718 --> 1:00:38.241]: 
  I guess I'm...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:57.765 --> 1:03:09.947]: 
  Yes I do. Maybe I don't know. What do you think he did like? German food? Yeah. Just brought, or brought, or washed and sauerkraut? That's probably why he's so pissed all the time, eating cabbage and sausage. He had like a little bouncer or something, he had some kind of weird intestinal thing. How do you know all this shit about Hitler? I don't, I made that up. Oh. Don't look it up. It's, it sounds like he would though. Haha. Sacks like, I don't like Hitler and that every time we ask him something there's like some fact, something like really. I don't like Hitler especially since 1905 when he was 10 years old. He seemed, yeah well. It all began. It all began in a small cabin in the middle of the woods. But I'm not, I don't like him though. I just, I don't like him even though he's handsome and strong and he took out of the juice. He had good goals. You're like, when you come up with lies for Hitler they're like within the realm of reason. You just say something like. Hitler had to grow a toenail. He was kind of handsome fellow without his mustache. Yeah. It looks like he kind of ruined it though. He decided to look silly. He ruined that mustache for everybody. Yeah, no one has the Hitler mustache anymore. Do you think he had like a Hitler bar mustache? People would have that anymore? You gotta be pretty fucked up to ruin an entire facial hairstyle. Yeah. I was friends of mine. I think, I think somebody's done this joke by now but yeah we'd always talk about like what if some, what if there's some guy in America named John Hitler and he would just show up and he'd be like, hey I'm John Hitler. And everyone's like, that's not funny. Yeah, they just, they're like. My grandfather was fortunate. My grandfather was Hitler's stopper. I've Googled it. There actually are people in this country with the last name Hitler and they just kept that name. That's gotta be a rough day for a job. He can interview. You think that the family name would just start changing that shit? I would believe it. My name would just like fucking Hitler. I would assume that people stopped using Adolf for their kids. Adolf is pro, yeah. It's a great name though. I like it. I'm on the back of a few thousand Adolfs out there. Adolf. Adolf. Adolf. It's kind of like Rudolph. He wasn't tied to that stupid fucking reindeer. Adolf for the reindeer. I'm gonna have a son and I'm gonna name him Rudolph Stamper and he's gonna get his ass beat every day. You know, if Hitler got a, if Hitler was a transsexual, he would probably call himself Adal Hitler.

But for some reason some asshole put pickles in it Like it's just there's this over here. It's like shit in it. That just doesn't make sense I probably told you guys like My favorite episode of anything ever on the food network is one of those food challenge shows So this dude has to go prepare like a huge banquet feast for a Jewish The community center artist a pig dude, right? Yeah, apparently, you know He he's like struggling to like get all this kosher food and he meets like the one Jewish person in charge And he's like, yeah, this might be a problem But and he like pulls his like shirt collar down and there's a tattoo of a bacon strip on his chest of the guy Cooking the Jewish food like he loves bacon. So what he loves? Yeah, it's a tattoo of fucking bacon on him and he's just sitting there sweating. I'm like, oh boy I got it. He's good. They think they're gonna beat his ass or something. I don't know. It's just You just say you used to be a cop and you got you out people use to call me a pig I will Think the kosher thing is extremely silly though You know, yeah, I got bacon tattooed on me because I used to be a cop and they used to call me a pig So I thought it was funny to embrace this thing. I love bacon. I like you fucking The Jews aren't fucking Nazi Germans, man, it's not like they're gonna do a couple of you a couple Nazi Jews I know this besides the point It's not like they're gonna three a couple look at you and be like, oh you eat bacon.

  I think he wanted to put like bacon and pork in all the recipes. That's why yeah. Oh, that's a bad idea Yeah, I just I just think yeah the whole kosher thing is weird It the biggest problem for me is that if you have that little stamp on your package of food It's like oh, it's okay to eat. You know it's governed by whatever but but King you who's to say like King Joe King of the Jews Like with the crap that that comes out of factories and she you tell me that like I'm sure a lot of kosher food is good But I'm sure people have been in the rules because people are inherently fucking lazy They're really doing the whole rich boy like the like conscience cut of cows throat in the proper way No, keep reading about these acidic to rabbi's like do you read about that Zach when they Hasidic Jews when they you know when they circumcise babies, they'll only suck the dick of the baby Yeah, yeah, they'll suck the blood out with their mouth and give them give them like a disease Herpes shit, it's brush your teeth first.

Well doesn't the... Dude, the big dude who sucks baby off his herpes. Yeah. But his mouth and he sucks the baby off and... Well he's not sucking the baby off. Oh yeah he is. Kinda. Maybe he doesn't see it as a sexual thing but... He's sucking the baby out. Well I guess the sexual view is playing with the kids balls and stuff too. Yeah. He's like this is tradition. Blah blah blah blah blah. The face of the tits, which one? I didn't know that. That's kind of uh... It's fucked up. It's interesting. Creepy. I'm gonna stop reading stuff on the internet now. What? Do you guys... Do you guys... Yes I'm circumcised. Do you wish you were that circumcised though? Oh why'd you assume that I was circumcised? Cause you're an American, you're a white dude. You gotta be circumcised. I'm not a fucking Joe. You're a privileged... A lot of Christians are though. I think most people in America are, yeah... Yeah, like, yeah it's the... Or most males at least, yeah. So you draw if you cut, you fucking... I am cut. And I got baptized with the magic water and I got the whole deal. I got this theory that if you draw like weeners for flash cartoons, or if you draw like dicks in general on boards or whatever, the dick you draw on the board is pretty much what yours looks like. Every now and again you'll see a guy draw like a weird yam, and you're like, oh so he's uncut there. Yeah, Stanford draws the best cut dicks ever. That's cause I look at mine all the time. I don't know how you draw them so well. It's like you're... They're just so three dimensional, even like the veins are... Yeah, you drew it earlier, you didn't do it like you drew it pretty fucking... I have to get this... I have to make this hot or anything. Yeah, you're making me horny, dude. Now I like to think about his penis. Making my mouth water. I don't know, it's kind of gay, but I'm like, envy is how well you draw dicks. You know what the sad part is? What? It's probably the thing that I could draw the best. Like if people captured you and they're like, draw the best dick you can, they'd be like, oh... I'd be like, oh yeah, if you draw the best dick you can, I'm gonna kill your family. I'd be like, there you go, and there you go. And that'd just be like a dick factory. I'd just be throwing them out. But then if he was like, draw Bart Simpson, I'd be like, oh god. I could draw Bart Simpson's dick if you want. Bart Simpson's little dick. I'll be right back. I have to go pee pee with my ding dong. Good luck. I don't need luck. Where the hell do you get those pants anyway? I have Jesus on my side. Jesus made them for me. Oh. They're comfortable as shit. They look comfortable. Mmm. And there's a little heart on the butt.

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:54.250 --> 1:06:58.283]:

They're actually mad straight people exist now. Straight white guys. Straight isn't good enough, gay isn't good enough. You have to be... Some weird... A magical hybrid of several things to be the most special of all. I was bored with the dick and balls and I liked the pussy. I like it a bully. He almost went like Italian there.

  Spiritually, I have a majestic centipede. What's a cool animal? Centipede, Ken? Yeah. So you just feel, you feel male, female, and centipede. Yeah, I feel all my legs all over the place. I walk on all 30 of my legs. You walk through the mall on all fours and you get mad when people look at you weird. They say, what are you doing, sir? I say, sir, the centipede, get the fuck away from me. Unless you have problems. What is like having a spirit animal, like a thing now? It's a big thing, but it's not even a thing. It's like, you identify with animals or something, I guess. Really? I don't know. You lose the whole world you don't know about and you're fucking lucky. There's a whole world I don't want to know about because I got my own problem, baby. It's a maddening, it's an infuriating look into. Yup, was happy, used to walk into the, I used to skip into the office every day. And now I'm reading this shit daily, getting mad, losing my fucking mind. Nobody's twisting your arm. Why you just jerk yourself to that shit? I get obsessed with infuriating people, exec. It's fascinating though, you look at these people and you wonder how they exist. These goddamn you and wonder how you exist. I don't give a fuck. These goddamn parents out there neglect their child and he sits home all day on the computer and... Completed by the Robin Williams is a what God does. Turns into one of these horrible creatures. Horrible, privileged, jobless, entitled, selfish creatures. I'm so oppressed. When I was born into a family who makes $200,000 a year, it paid my way through college. I saw a white homeless guy and said, check your privilege, you fucking white asshole. Oh, is that what check your privilege means? Yes. Is that what CYP means? CYP? I don't know, I don't pay. I'm so fucking sick and tired of anagrams every door, not anagrams, acronyms. I have to look up like, what is TV, TV? What the fuck, oh, it means whatever. You know what I was looking up like a million fucking times is when people say SMH. I get that too smack my head, right? Or shake my head or whatever. You're so stupid, SMH. I never knew what that one was. Fuck is SMH. Yeah, I know, it really irritates me. You just fucking speak English. You only want to know or... We just leave it out. The only one I actually use is like, I don't really use LOL that much. I guess LOL. I use LOL sarcastically. By the way, I use sometimes BTW, sometimes I do that. I never use OMG. I like BRB guys. BRBs, all right. Because when I get tired of talking to people, I'm just like BRB. Oh dude, BBL is a fucking lifesaver. BBL. What is that? B back later. Oh.
