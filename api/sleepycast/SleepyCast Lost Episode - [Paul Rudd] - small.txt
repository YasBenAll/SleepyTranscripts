 SPEAKER_02: 
  Skip, walk a lot of leads? Yeah, no, ride. Ride. Take, ride. Sounds like crying.

 SPEAKER_01: 
  Like they didn't even have they didn't even have the decency to give them to try. There's just like

  There's just like a run. What's a run? He'll take that. He's a Jewish? No, he's not a Jewish.

 SPEAKER_01: 
  Why'd you say that was such disdain and hatred? No, it's not!

 SPEAKER_02:

 SPEAKER_02: 
  He could be a secret Jew. Why do you mean, and he can just make a road? What? He could go to his house and find out he's a secret Jew. Maybe he has little Jewish guys. That's what he was just saying. Secret Jew.

 SPEAKER_03: 
  I would tell my friends at the restaurant, hey, I think it's Paul Rudd. He walks over to the spaghetti, hey guys. The second I left the restaurant, I totally forget I saw him and wouldn't tell anybody ever again.

 SPEAKER_02: 
  And then the second...

 SPEAKER_01: 
  Hey guys, it's me, Paul Rowe.

 SPEAKER_01:

 SPEAKER_01: 
  As a word. Yeah. With just marinara, like mint sauce.

 SPEAKER_02: 
  No, they only have one kind of spaghetti, French sauce, noodles. What if it's red? The minute he just says spaghetti. What if it's red sauce? You know, like, no. You got red sauce? He could say it is. He could say, oh, it's red sauce. And they go, no, it's still spaghetti sauce. Don't make it up. What is, what's in red sauce? Don't fuck it up, restaurant.

 SPEAKER_03: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01: 
  That's what you're preparing Jeff for? I might nod slightly.

 SPEAKER_03:

 SPEAKER_01: 
  I'd be like, get the fuck away from me. I'm trying to eat my spaghetti. Not good with buddy, touches your shoulder. Good with. What if you came home and tried to steal the garlic bread? I'd be like, Paul runs a fucking asshole.

 SPEAKER_02: 
  Slapping his head, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03: 
  Yeah, we read it out. After convincing me he was Paul Ruddy, he'd be like, So yeah, good weather. I'll acknowledge him. I'll say you were good in that movie.

 SPEAKER_02: 
  So yeah, good weather, like, fuck.

 SPEAKER_02: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02:

 SPEAKER_01: 
  Yeah. Oh, now his name's dropping? Yeah, yeah, you go stick around.

 SPEAKER_03: 
  Oh, which is how much you please though. You appear perfectly unoffensive and... Oh, why you say that man?

 SPEAKER_02: 
  Oh, why are you saying that, man? You did your job. What are you saying that for? Do you know who I am? I always said I love you, man. Yeah. You have a spare DVD, Paul's that I just popped in your ear. What do you think his favorite movie is?

 SPEAKER_03: 
  I love you man. That's his crowning achievement.

 SPEAKER_01: 
  What if he's a total asshole in real life? What if he ran over to your table and started eating your spaghetti with his bare hands?

 SPEAKER_02: 
  What do you fucking do? What do you fucking do? Do some baggy punch me. Punch for a ride. Nobody can see you.

 SPEAKER_03: 
  Nobody can see you. Nobody can see you. Nobody can see you. No. Zach's pretending he's eating.

 SPEAKER_02: 
  That's how you spaghetti, yeah that'd be worse too, he's getting fucking spaghetti obviously. The kids who ran out of spaghetti, they'll give me your spaghetti. I see him.

 SPEAKER_01: 
  The kids ran out of spaghetti. Give me your spaghetti. I see him. What worse?

 SPEAKER_03: 
  It's the worst as him coming over and like arrogantly sticking like just one finger in your food and then like licking it and then walking away. And then smiling with that smug face of his where he's just like Mmmmm, putting the water and polaroid. Do eating spiety like that is too much personality for Paul Rudd. Yeah, that's true.

 SPEAKER_01: 
  and he's smiling with that smug face where he's just like

 SPEAKER_02: 
 ери water i pill Aberdeen

 SPEAKER_01: 
  You ever eat spaghetti with your bare hands though? It's really liberating. You just take a big plate of it and just grab it and just...

 SPEAKER_02: 
  Go ahead.

 SPEAKER_02: 
  I think the closest thing I've done that is you though, the good, like a dog.

 SPEAKER_03: 
  You savages can do what you want. I'm not going to eat. I'm not going to eat.

 SPEAKER_01: 
  Alright, Queen Victoria, Queen Victoria married Paul Rudd. This is my husband, Paul Rudd. The most interesting man on the face of the planet.

 SPEAKER_02: 
  What do you think the color of the favorite color is? You think it's really like blue?

 SPEAKER_03: 
  Hey, can we make Paul Gettios with red sauce one night?

 SPEAKER_01: 
  What's spaghetti? Spaghetti and red balls and just little... Little heavy...

 SPEAKER_02: 
  What do you think the conversion for that would be? What do you think? How would he advertise it? Hey guys, people are right. You probably saw me over there and over there that movie one time. I was over there too one time. That's what I was beginning though. It's good. You want to see what it is? You have to wait until you get at the bottom of the can.

 SPEAKER_00: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03: 
  I was over there too with time.

 SPEAKER_00: 
  Just for life's sake.

 SPEAKER_03: 
  I think he would allow, he would allow one chest hair to escape his car. I'm saying, he's a ticy, he's saying- He's slightly dangerous, not too dangerous.

 SPEAKER_02: 
  I'm sad.

 SPEAKER_02: 
  Listen, I think this is a good idea. You buy this spaghetti because it gives you a taste. It says, hey, you want the rest of it? It's at the bottom of the can. So when you dub out the can of spaghetti sauce, uh-huh. I'm sure it looks like that. Show it everything.

 SPEAKER_01: 
  He himself is at the bottom of the can of spaghetti sauce. Yeah, because he shows you a little bit. Well, he's just little or it's a photo of him. What are you talking about? Shut up!

 SPEAKER_02: 
  What are you talking about shut up? In the commercial, this is Belly Up, it says here you would see the rest of this by the spaghetti sauce and you'll see me at the bottom of the spaghetti sauce

 SPEAKER_01: 
  Oh, everybody uses a full jar of spaghetti sauce when they make spaghetti anyways. You just dump it in. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. You gotta prepare a couple of compliments of box.

 SPEAKER_03: 
  We have been talking about this mediocre human being for over 20 years.

 SPEAKER_01: 
  That's fucked up. He's gonna listen to this. Don't call him mediocre. He's a great guy. He's a perfectly acceptable guy. He makes more money than you do. He's jealous. Well... I'm on Rudside.

 SPEAKER_03: 
  Those are both true facts.

 SPEAKER_02: 
  How big do you think his dick is?

 SPEAKER_01: 
  Average? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03: 
  Okay, yeah. Trying to come up with a clever answer. I wouldn't be so, I don't think I'd be so...

 SPEAKER_02: 
  I wouldn't be surprised if I saw pride

 SPEAKER_03: 
  Just, it'd be the perfect human male white male average.

 SPEAKER_02: 
  Not bad, not great, you wouldn't talk about it, would you? Yeah, it'd be like half the size of mine.

 SPEAKER_03: 
  You know what? You ever see those pictures when people take hundreds of portraits of humans? And they should do it in person? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02: 
  People take

 SPEAKER_02: 
  and measure him to one person? Yeah. And he's all red. He's the scientific measure of every white guy on earth. Yeah. Paul Rudd.

 SPEAKER_03: 
  Here he is. He might not even be real. You don't know if he's real.

 SPEAKER_02: 
  You think he was the scientist trying to actually make that guy? He got loose and wanted to run to a Hollywood tour. Nobody stopped him.

 SPEAKER_03: 
  He's like, he's like, bison tenio man. Oh yeah, that fucks me up.

 SPEAKER_02: 
  Oh yeah that fucking movie. But it looks more like Paul Rudd. You know the guy from Jurassic Park was on that? Which guy? I've never seen it. The guy from Jurassic Park 1. Which guy? The main dude. Oh Grant? Yeah, that, that, Jeff Goldblum. Oh was he the father or something? Yeah he's the dad. He's like oh we got a robot. It's Rob Williams.

 SPEAKER_03: 
  which I've never seen.

 SPEAKER_03: 
  So we'll see the father.

 SPEAKER_01: 
  Was that a horror movie that that Jurassic Park dude was in? Like something arising? Oh, oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_03:
