 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:59.933 --> 0:08:25.937]: 
  He tried to. He wanted a naked, casual, rarity farting alone with emphasis on the fart. What's a casual fart? Where was she in the room? She was naked against the wall farting. Against the wall? I did a sexy, naughty, spread butt fart and he's like, it's not good enough. I want to get your hands. Why didn't he just send you like and be like, I want her to say this exact sequence of letters. B-T-T-P-T-J-J-B-B. I guess he thought my, you know, like, artist integrity was good. You thought you could handle it, but you obviously couldn't do it.

  You could handle it, but you obviously couldn't do it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:08:25.448 --> 0:08:34.375]: 
  You think if you would have got the other way to give him a too big of a fart he would be discussed like a like a glop or something Dude don't go for a glop

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:31.995 --> 0:08:40.956]:

No. It sounds like it should be, right? Why? What if you had done like cartoon plants wilting and like Victorian ladies swimming in the background? He didn't want that. Big, green, smell-wise. He should have just died. I wanted naked rarity partying casually. He doesn't know how rarity farts are. Like it fucking stinks. It's not real, you're making it up.

  Was it a red fart or a brown fart?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:52.945 --> 0:10:15.743]: 
  There was no color. And I was like, listen. That's K2S, C1S. I'm like, listen, I'm glad you didn't do one of those classic green farts, because I'm not ready for that. It was a Photoshop checkerboard fight. No, it was just a simple text, you know. I also did the weirds, I did the lines weird. There was official Sky Checkerboard Typhoon.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:24.855 --> 0:11:06.503]: 
  Yeah, it's about it. Have you ever done a porn commission? No, not really. I've actually made them more porny than they tend to ask for. But you draw like... I do it. I just can't draw good porn. You get a lot of your own characters being asked for it. That must be flattering. Those are the ones I put the effort into because it's like I don't have to do that. I hate having to look at reference. I hate having to be like, oh, I have to draw Bayonetta. I had no idea what she looked like. Her costume is her hair. She like weaves her hair under her tits. I just looked at her and took her for granted. She was more like a catsuit. And then you go on Google, I'm like, what are these Japanese guys dreaming up over there? Just to clarify, I'm not shaming anybody for what you're into, but I'm shaming you if you fucking... If you shame an artist and you weren't the one who was doing vivid details to begin with, and you're a fucking prude with details...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:10:25.733 --> 0:10:27.235]: 
  Have you ever done a porn commission?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:33.023 --> 0:10:36.229]: 
  You get a lot of your own characters being asked for that. That must be flattering.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:37.815 --> 0:10:38.794]: 
  I know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:38.794 --> 0:10:41.055]: 
  I hate having to look at reference. I hate having to like, oh, man.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:47.974 --> 0:10:49.240]: 
  No, no, I can't.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:55.990 --> 0:10:57.002]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:11:06.503 --> 0:11:09.962]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:09.152 --> 0:11:25.116]: 
  Oh, can I call this bozo out? He wanted me to draw a lion king character and I just don't want to draw like Simba or something. No, no, no, but also, was this the same guy as who was doing it? No, it wasn't. He was the guy who wanted me to draw like his Simba Osea getting fucked by a horse. Yeah, I was just gonna say, yeah, but...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:11:22.990 --> 0:11:34.397]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but my point is why would there ever be a horse in the Sahara? He said he's African. There's never be a regular. Make it a zero. Yeah, that's what Corey said. Make it a zebra. No. No, he wanted to be a horse.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:29.487 --> 0:11:31.005]: 
  Make it a zero.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:31.005 --> 0:11:41.890]: 
  That's what Corey said, I'll make it a zebra, no. No, he wanted a horse. Every time I'm like, I want to do it, he sent me a novel. I'm like, I don't want to do it. He would send me another novel. Corey, you're trying to handle all this.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:11:38.397 --> 0:11:40.169]: 
  Min.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:11:40.995 --> 0:11:46.952]: 
  Could I convince you if I said her hooves were fucking hot? It was a guy who was the big dick.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:44.100 --> 0:12:12.450]: 
  It was a guy who was the big dick, not a girl who was nice. Was it Kid Samba? Or was it Matthew Broderick full-grown Samba? It was Kid Samba. Oh, Jesus. It was Little Cubs. Can't wait to be king so much. You just can't wait to be poor. Yeah, again, like, I don't care. If you have an OC, if you have a symbol OC, you know, more power to you. But if you want me to draw your OC and then I say no and you continuously send me the story you had planned, I'm not gonna fucking draw your OC still. Harry. You're not gonna convince me with your novel.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:46.952 --> 0:11:48.606]:

  You're so hot.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:56.993 --> 0:12:02.292]: 
  I just can't wait to be poor. Yeah, again, like I don't care. If you have an OC, if you have a symbol OC,

 SPEAKER_04 [0:12:12.450 --> 0:12:22.289]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:03.730 --> 0:26:24.300]: 
  Oh yeah, let's start with a question. Let's talk about the worst animated movie you've seen. Not worst as in the way it was done, but just you don't like it and you're tired of seeing it whenever you see it. It was just boring, stupid, frozen. Absolutely. That is easily one of the worst, but I'm talking like not frozen in a sense where it's like bad, I'm talking like prior frozen. Because frozen was really well done.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:15.576 --> 0:26:16.082]: 
  That's what I'm talking about.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:21.668 --> 0:26:27.692]: 
  Because frozen was really well done. I wouldn't call frozen the worst anime film, but I call it. Shitty, it's awful.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:26.815 --> 0:26:32.637]: 
  Shitty, it's awful. I hate frozen, but I'm talking about like before frozen The shit like jelly tarzan and stuff, but that's not...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:30.021 --> 0:26:34.527]: 
  The shit like Jelly Tarzan and stuff, but that's not... Yes, we would say there's like different categories.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:33.514 --> 0:27:18.452]: 
  Do you mean the most shitty like mainstream? Yeah, like mainstream before frozen There seems to be a whole bunch of movies these days that people go nuts for like I didn't see inside out Okay, you know what that's my I hated Yeah, I'm sure it's great this is a thing All right, that's part of the reason it bothers me because I'm sure it's really well made and it makes me feel like an idiot Because I'm sure that my like opinion of it is completely unjustified, but it just looks so okay Yeah, I'm gonna say this is a bad thing to say Looks fucking gay Just looks like like when I was a kid. I was like really hyped up that movie small soldiers. You ever see small? Yeah, I love small soldiers. I fucking like cuz it's like did you see it though? Yes I love it. 12 times. There's like little badass soldier guys like stabbing people and like, you know, I where are the movies for that? That was great. I think I think great.

Veggie Tales, whatever the fuckin'- In the Donkey Kong cartoon, for some reason, in every episode, they had to have a song, but every day, watching it, was just like, You got 90s people, that guy. Yeah. Just no point. Why go through the effort of writing a song if every kid's gonna hate it anyway? All the people that were dancing had to, like, show off how good their motion capturing is. They're always fuckin' like, dancing, and they're standing still. It's like, what's the old guy's name? He's like, you're Cranky. Whatcha doin' with all my bananas? Like, he's always, like, fuckin' flailin' his hands around, and then Cranky's like, you know, he's also, like, throwing his fuckin' hands around to the show. Yeah, it's so cool to look at. It's- but they had, like, really good, like, dance choreography. Like, King Carolla's, like, fuckin' like, spinning like a ballerina, doing all these crazy dances and shakin' his legs. Wait, is this a CGI show? Yeah, it's a CGI show. I've never heard of motion capture. You've never seen a Donkey Kong cartoon. It's not what you've ever put it on. It's horrible.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:15.645 --> 0:33:23.324]: 
  Here's the thing for fucking writers don't make your characters get interesting when the whole fuck when the first fucking season is almost done

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:21.923 --> 0:33:27.002]: 
  Yeah, if you have a show, you don't want to say, oh yeah, it gets good in episode 12 of Seeds of the War.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:26.614 --> 0:33:31.305]: 
  When I saw a Seinfeld, like the later seasons got really good, but the first season we're still charming and good.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:30.765 --> 0:33:32.335]: 
  This is not good, you're still watching.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:32.065 --> 0:33:35.946]: 
  But I mean the later ones got really funny. Someone told me that Final Fantasy XIII

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:35.946 --> 0:33:39.557]: 
  it's good a hundred hours in you literally yeah yeah when people

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:37.937 --> 0:33:47.438]: 
  Yeah, when people see me that I'm like, I'm not gonna play a game for 22 hours just to experience the fruits of fucking Final Fantasy and it's good

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:41.481 --> 0:33:42.899]: 
  game for 22 hours just to

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:42.899 --> 0:33:43.270]: 
  experience.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:47.438 --> 0:33:48.754]: 
  for example, he wanted it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:48.754 --> 0:34:15.501]: 
  Okay, so Squidbillies is one of those things where I remember everyone's like oh watch Squidbillies and I watched the first episode It's just like these squid hicks that kill everybody and I'm like, oh it gets good. I'm like when does it start getting good? It's like oh it gets good by season three. No, they're just hicks The only one that's likable is his son because he's a gullible idiot who gets caught with his daddy He's like suck suck on the side of the shotgun There's candy at the end of it. He sucks on his fucking head explodes. He's like you're not supposed to pull the trigger idiot It's like oh dude, you know what's weird?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:15.501 --> 0:34:31.565]: 
  I sometimes watch like podcasts and stuff as background noise and sometimes I like watch Howard Stern clips And there's this like homophobic racist clown who's like an actual asshole very unfunny And I found out very recently that this clown is the creator of Brickleberry Oh It's a clown It's a clown

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:25.304 --> 0:34:26.132]: 
  And I found out very quickly.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:29.625 --> 0:34:32.106]: 
  It's like a cloud. It's like a cloud. It's like a soft cloud.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:31.447 --> 0:34:33.844]: 
  Yeah, he voices better the better

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:33.844 --> 0:34:36.274]: 
  A clown from Howard Stern invented Brickleblur.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:35.937 --> 0:34:40.442]: 
  That's what that's what bed there is. Yeah, okay, it's just like all you smoke so drinks. He's a little better Okay, yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:40.442 --> 0:34:45.319]: 
  Yeah, and that's TV shows like with very quick like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:43.530 --> 0:34:44.492]: 
  I'm just seeing it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:45.319 --> 0:34:52.052]: 
  Yo, what's up, HornySupply? It was Subbojack! To be a brand new character, never seen before late to be subboir!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:46.686 --> 0:36:00.447]: 
  It was so bojack! To be a brighter character never see before they drink a pour. I remember I watched the first episode I watched a bric-o-barry. The first episode I watched a bric-o-barry, it was fucking like, it was the one where these hillbillies bring like these hillbilly tornadoes. Like they come in on tornadoes. Did they watch that wikiwiki? Yeah, they come in on the tornadoes. It was trying to be so offensive as possible. Like these like overly stereotyped like guides where it's like it was just it was just written for the sake of being offensive. And I was talking to like someone it's like when you write something of being just your whole point is being offensive and the characters aren't likeable. There's nothing charming about them. They're just charmingly offensive. I was watching this thing I'm called a Captain Tartigrade on the Newgrounds thing. And the character is like he's an asshole in a degree, but he's not meant to be an asshole. I really enjoyed those Captain Tartigrades. But he's just like this guy who's like impervious and can't die, but he's just like you know, he's like he's trying to give like helpful safety tips to these kids. And these kids just like stick their hands in fucking stockings. Sockets get electrocuted and he's just like you learned your lesson. He's like I learned them out of Tartigrades like yeah, good job. But it's funny because he didn't force like stick your hand in the socket and hurt yourself dumb ass. It's none of that stuff. But that's what Brickleberry is. It's like trying to be as offensive as possible with no point. I think it's like going to lose.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:48.947 --> 0:34:48.998]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:52.052 --> 0:34:54.449]: 
  I remember I watched the first episode I watched the first episode.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:35:01.958 --> 0:35:06.059]: 
  Like they come in on tornadoes. Did they watch that wikiwikori? Yeah, they come in on that tornadoes. It was a telly in Rust House.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:09.990 --> 0:35:10.497]: 
  you

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:27.372 --> 0:35:28.334]: 
  Yeah!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:32.535 --> 0:35:34.375]: 
  I really enjoyed those Captain Turtles.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:38.357 --> 0:35:38.442]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:38.442 --> 0:35:40.585]:

  Yeah, good job, Taylor. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:35:58.995 --> 0:36:05.948]: 
  I think this even ties into Harry's series too, because you know you're kidding. No, no, no, I'm serious in the sense of

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:05.948 --> 0:36:09.559]: 
  So it's barbarians? Yes, your characters are debuted, but they're also not like...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:06.758 --> 0:36:11.247]: 
  Yes, your characters are weird, but they're also not like, they're not malicious characters.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:10.707 --> 0:36:33.471]: 
  Well, I don't think I've really like done the idea justice yet because each episode takes a fucking lifetime to make but eventually I think I'll get that yeah, but when you get I think like the thing is the offensiveness has to be a byproduct It can be the purpose if you're trying to do something really funny and it just happens to offend that's okay Yeah, if you're trying to offend and hoping it turns out funny. It's only funny to some people

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:27.784 --> 0:36:27.953]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:30.990 --> 0:36:41.942]: 
  funny to some people.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:39.276 --> 0:37:15.490]: 
  Yeah These like tractors landed and these hillbillies are sitting in their fucking like pulled out seats and then they're like yeah look at these fucking It's the writers like I'm gonna go fuck my writers are like they watch future. I'm they're like benders really funny Let's make all of her characters like benders like just no one to riff off each other then exactly unique contrast Yeah, everyone be an asshole. Yeah, and I'm just juxtaposed what they do is they see Bendre act like a cotton They're like that's funny, but they don't realize the bender always gets his come up into exactly like cotton like yeah The one at the time the common like basically gets his one up on someone in the episode. Yeah, that is like so earned

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:47.325 --> 0:36:51.105]: 
  It's the writers. I'm gonna go fuck my sister. The writers are like, like, if they watch...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:56.252 --> 0:36:56.775]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:17.025 --> 0:38:09.304]: 
  Yeah, I also hate Scott Tenerent too so I always thought that Bender was one of the best well-written characters He is in all regard supposed to be a shitty character. He steals. He's mean He's an asshole he kills and he's like wants to kill all humans But then he meets Fry and fries like his best friend So you get this like humanitarian side to him where he loves fry and you'll do anything for him But he'll be like fry I'll kill humans for you like he's like So he like kills you know stab someone to save fry like he's like hold on I'll help you fry and he puts a person in front of him that gets the trade. He's like no no We're good. We're all squared off. He's in this kind of a balance Yeah, because you need like that if you have somebody who's just a belligerent asshole even like him where he's just like a conniving Manipulative like he goes that he like cheats on women robots But he's like, you know, he clearly has a humanitarian even when he gets his comeuppance He's still like well He'll feel sorry for him when he's like in that state when you should feel sorry for him even

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:35.655 --> 0:37:36.027]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:42.304 --> 0:37:42.996]: 
  he's a union.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:42.996 --> 0:37:43.502]: 
  So you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:52.075 --> 0:37:52.092]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:01.002 --> 0:38:01.474]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:38:05.001 --> 0:38:05.744]: 
  it still feels like

 SPEAKER_04 [0:38 --> 0:38:23.631]: 
  Even in shows where the whole cast is like assholes or jerks, like Sidenfell, they're always sunny, but the main cast is supposed to be kind of jerks. They still make an appeal, and everybody in that world hates them, and they constantly lose their losers.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:15.413 --> 0:38:15.734]: 
  That would have been Hurrah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:17.657 --> 0:38:18.754]: 
  Yeah, they still think he'll go back to equilibrium.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:22.635 --> 0:38:38.616]: 
  I think like I don't like that show drawn together you ever watch that yeah That's an offensive term I like the concept of the show I like the some of the animation in it, but my god like what's his name captain hero? He's just horrible like horribly offensive. I think it's that's

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:26.449 --> 0:38:27.512]: 
  That was example.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:27.074 --> 0:38:29.352]: 
  That's an offensive term we talked about.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:38:36.659 --> 0:38:40.506]: 
  Like horribly offensive. I think one of the- It's not funny, it's just like, okay, yeah?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:40.506 --> 0:39:32.025]: 
  Yeah, he fucks corpses. I know right? Like that Homer's a obviously classic character, but fucks corpses Character I do like and join together and that's bulldozer sock back. Yeah a little like yellow bag Yes, punch Bob because his character like Waldor. He's just just like gullible idiot. He's like people's friends He's not vindictive. He's not very exactly. He can't be vindictive, but that's only if he's manipulated. He's a nice guy He tries to be nice, but people are mean to him and when he is an asshole It's kind of charming because he's really bad at it when you see his character Like he's a really entertaining character in that sense. It's like so strange because the gay character Xander yeah, he'll kill somebody for no reason He'll just be like a mafia guy like cutting someone up and you just be like you give me your fucking money Then the next time you'd be like fucking a guy. It's just like yeah, it's like weird like you don't even care about

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:49.568 --> 0:38:52.437]: 
  During season 27, it goes out to the zoo.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:52.437 --> 0:38:54.951]: 
  That's not what I'm doing. This is a one character duel.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:54.951 --> 0:38:55.170]: 
  like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:56.436 --> 0:38:59.001]: 
  the little like yellow guy

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:04.064 --> 0:39:06.308]: 
  He's no vindictive. He's no vicious.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:18.981 --> 0:39:19.386]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:39:30.338 --> 0:39:34.169]: 
  It's like weird like you don't even care. It's all just trying to work your heart.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:33.494 --> 0:39:42.505]: 
  It's too hard. It's too hard. Like Spanky Pig is a shitty fucking character. I hate it Spanky Pig. They're all essentially the same character. Exactly. They're all just like horrible.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:38.657 --> 0:39:40.935]: 
  It's essentially the same character.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:40.935 --> 0:39:44.817]: 
  They're all just like horribly offensive murdering psychos

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:42.505 --> 0:39:47.939]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:54.722 --> 0:40:17.183]: 
  I've seen a few of them. There's a part where he fucking makes a robot that hands him butter, and then he puts butter on the plate, and he's like, What do I do now? He's like, oh, you created for butter, and that's your only purpose in life. Yeah, and then he's like- He has enough sentience to know that he's like, this is not purpose in life, it's just to hand butter. Yeah, and he's like, well, but welcome to the human race. But he doesn't like mean it to be a dick. No, it's just a revelation, like, well, welcome to the human race.

  It smells like a dead body.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:43.043 --> 0:42:01.909]: 
  Yeah, and then Brian would be like, yeah, let's cut her open and get inside of her. Then they cut her open and pull her out. He'd say, who? They found a new magazine to read. That's the joke. Season 12 family guys like, did you laugh? I did. They would literally, they would just try to be offensive. He's like, oh, what's the first thing to ride? It's like, the liver. You think there's gonna be a beer in there and I'll rip it open and then they'll come and start fucking it. It's like, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:47.447 --> 0:41:48.274]:

  It would literally, it would literally,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:59.445 --> 0:42:00.998]: 
  Open

 SPEAKER_04 [0:42:00.441 --> 0:42:21.872]: 
  I was watching a thing where like Peter's tried to impress Chris and so he like walks over to Bronson Decapitated head of the child is like to get that boy. I can't tell if you're kidding. No No, no, no, no That's real. Is it real? And then Chris says that's not my boy and he says oh whoops, that's the joke

  He漂亮 way

 SPEAKER_04 [0:42:50.948 --> 0:42:57.377]: 
  Wow, I can't believe we've got so good for it to write that joke to your podcast.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:57.377 --> 0:43:03.942]: 
  That was another thing I can't stand that they do is when they were like drag something out way too fucking long Yeah like 12 minutes of an 18's movie to-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:01.917 --> 0:43:09.021]: 
  Yeah, like 12 minutes of an 18s movie just recreated shot for shot. You know anything? Take it away! You should have quit his office early that day.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:05.325 --> 0:43:05.494]: 
  You know what?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:43:05.494 --> 0:43:07.587]: 
  Take it away, Conway Twiggy.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:43:08.785 --> 0:43:26.014]: 
  It sucks is that they do that like it's a win-win for them because if you know the reference like oh, it's that reference But if you don't know it, they just seem really clever. Yeah, except before I did it Ted Which is why that's what I lost respect for he stole he stole a joke from airplane the airplane Yeah, but airplanes a comedy film. Yeah, it's not who much that points joke theft. Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:21.306 --> 0:43:22.386]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:25.660 --> 0:43:30.756]: 
  Yeah, what was the joke, do you remember? It was the... It was the scene where he's like, how did we meet? Yeah, how did we meet the girl? And it was the bar...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:43:27.330 --> 0:43:34.418]: 
  It was like how did we beat yeah, how did they meet the girl and he walked sailing does they dance to the thing?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:33.085 --> 0:43:41.775]: 
  It's the same exact thing, but like yeah to the people who've never seen airplanes like that was a funny joke Yeah, yeah, yeah, people have have seen airplanes like that was a funny reference.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:35.937 --> 0:43:36.949]: 
  who's never seen their

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:36.949 --> 0:43:37.995]: 
  That was funny.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:43:37.995 --> 0:43:39.126]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:43:41.269 --> 0:43:49.909]: 
  But see, I hadn't seen an airplane in a long time. So I left the field when I saw that part. That was the only joke I left at. I was like, that's for an airplane, do you see it? That part, I was like, oh.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:42.417 --> 0:43:44.037]: 
  Yeah, you had to senior play. So I left.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:46.484 --> 0:44:45.377]: 
  The frozen, that's for airplay, do you see it? You know what I think the problem is? We'll just say this strictly. I think this is the problem with like the new Powerpuff Girls is they take a trait and they blow up to a hundred. So like if Dewey was at any point a cross-dressing gay man, gay baby, sorry, that he is a fucking super homo cross-dresser in like the newer season. It's called Flenderization. I was about to say, yeah, Flenderization. It's exactly what it, like in the new Powerpuff Girls like, you know, the tomboy was Buttercup, but in the older one she kind of was a tomboy on occasion. She showed her tomboyness, but she wasn't consistently like, oh, let's get in a bro fight. I'm so awesome. I'm so cool. She's like a dyke now. Yeah, she's just like a boringly written dyke. And like all the other characters are just boring, over set. And some of them don't even make sense. Like in the old one, fucking like Bubbles is just like this like innocent, cutesy girl who played with dolls. And this one she's just like, she's catching up on the hottest memes and she's fucking like listening to twerk songs. Like get the fuck out of here. She's not accurate at all.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:57.081 --> 0:43:58.431]: 
  The simple type?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:07.459 --> 0:44:08.944]: 
  after pranking the guy andlé

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:08.944 --> 0:44:11.492]: 
  I was about to say, yeah, the tropes are amazing.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:24.216 --> 0:44:26.376]: 
  She's like a dyke now. Yeah, she's like...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:42.255 --> 0:44:42.593]: 
  It's like,

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:43.639 --> 0:44:48.584]: 
  She's not accurate at all. She checks though your video every day. She's refreshing troll face on Wikipedia. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:48.077 --> 0:45:04.294]: 
  There's a new episode of the Simpsons where Smithers comes out as gay like did the person who wrote that not get that the joke Like he comes out as gay no you're not getting Smithers he hides that he's gay. Yeah, that's the joke. Yes, they run out of

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:55.941 --> 0:44:56.228]: 
  Yes!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:04.294 --> 0:45:06.370]: 
  shit at this point I get it I was watching

 SPEAKER_04 [0:45:05.020 --> 0:45:18.503]: 
  I get it. I was watching a newer episode and they did some bit where it's like letting you car all like holy hands and like they played it seriously And uh, Marge was like oh good for them. I was waiting for the joke. That was it. No, it's just they're gay. They're gay faggots

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:14.976 --> 0:45:14.993]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:14.993 --> 0:45:25.945]: 
  We put a joke in those if they know it's just a gay their gay bags. They fuck fuck fuck He's like what's his name? He's like hey homie

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:25.945 --> 0:45:28.949]: 
  What was that? What was that? That was a weird, that was a weird.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:45:26.940 --> 0:45:33.437]: 
  That was a weird like four different voices. You just want to catch the voice.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:30.062 --> 0:46:22.493]: 
  Who's the guy with like crazy red hair? No, who's the guy with like crazy like red hair who's like Sideshow Bob? There's like so much porn of Sideshow Bob. What? What? Honestly, of all the porn, like if you think of like, you know, um... Hair like the fumes? Yeah, if you think of Bart fucking like Lisa or like Marge fucking Bart or Homer fucking all this like stuff of them fucking the family fucking each other there's way more of Sideshow Bob like carving lines in the Bart's head while he fucks it The Sideshow Mal ever getting on the accident? He's like take his bone out and shove it in the bone out? No, no, no, it's always Sideshow Bob and Bart because I remember like Sideshow Bob wanting to kill Bart Sideshow Mal is such a funny character. Yeah, he's good. He's such a failure because of all the cringey. So that's always been interesting to me. You'd expect to see more like of Marge but there's more Sideshow Bob. It's progressive that way.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:45:34.821 --> 0:45:35.901]: 
  I'm already here.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:47.984 --> 0:45:48.507]:

Was like, what do you think? He's trying to set a race for by killing. Yeah, he's trying to set a race for. Like, he thought like, he was doing good. But who has it? Do you know what I mean? We both had it back then. He always gets a really hard girlfriend to visit in the prison. Yeah, he's been married like five times since he's been in prison. Oh, yeah. That's because, I think at this point, they released him. He just started killing again. They'd be like, well, I guess we didn't really, it's just a- But she's really fallen.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:36.287 --> 0:47:37.941]: 
  He's trying to set a race score.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:45.029 --> 0:47:47.965]: 
  Oh yeah, I think in this way they've released him

 SPEAKER_04 [0:47:50.935 --> 0:47:56.909]: 
  It's a question of doing a follow up again. Can he convince anybody to kill anybody again? I do it for him. Well, this time you can kill anybody.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:55.052 --> 0:49:23.106]: 
  I do it for him. Well, this time you can knock over his walker and you won't be able to do much. If you just do those faces, you just ask him questions. Yeah, he's a quarter of them. He's not. He's not. Maybe that's why he gives so many girlfriends. They're just like, just put your head down there. I'm not gonna ask you a question. He's the only guy who's had that with their hands.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:46.806 --> 0:51:46.780]: 
  No, what? No! What's the one with the baby with the purple cram? What are you talking about? Kayu? No dude, Kayu's like a dumb cancer patient, always gets grounded. How come every time I bring up Kayu, everyone says he has cancer? He's a little kebab patient. He's not. It's just this little spoiled shit, like for fucking babies, who gets grounded. How come the backgrounds are never colored improperly? Because they're in like a fucking endless void, they all died years ago, didn't you see the creepypasta? Pernatory. It's not for federator! 107 facts about Kayu being dead. Is Kayu dead? Kayu's cancer had died and all these items are from his fucking patients room. They said about Pokemon. They said Pokemon was like he got in a fucking coma, and that's why he doesn't ride bikes anymore, because he got in a coma because of the bike accident. And that's why he sees Nurse Joy and everyone in the same town, no matter where he goes, because he's in a coma, so the only first people he saw is the reason why he sees them. This is based on an old Game Boy game, extremely limited memory resources probably. No, this is based on the anime, not the fucking video game. Harry. This is Pokemon Yellow, dude. Are they the underrated films?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:50.991 --> 0:50:52.139]: 
  What are you talking about?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:50:52.139 --> 0:50:52.425]:

  Like how the fuck does it have more like the left one?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:52.568 --> 0:52:32.865]: 
  There's a movie called Rock and Roll, which is an old 80s movie where they had like real life musicians like Blondie and I think Lou Reed Really? Do songs for the soundtrack, but this like music is part of it and it is kind of like a furry movie because it's like a world of dog people but it's super beautiful and I never hear anyone talk about it. What's it called? Rock and Roll. Rock and Roll. And it's kind of like very dark, very kind of gritty looking. It's kind of like a cool dystopian rock and roll action movie, but it's from like 1991. It's interesting when you know what stuff you never really see until you're older and you realize that all this stuff is online and you could totally just watch it. That's a great question, but like it's gonna hit me six hours from now. No, I can't see what people are doing. I finally have an answer.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:09.561 --> 0:52:10.169]: 
  What's it called?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:52:12.025 --> 0:52:12.582]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:19.180 --> 0:52:19.635]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:25.879 --> 0:52:27.955]: 
  I totally just want you to that's a great question

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:29.018 --> 0:52:38.012]: 
  $6 from now, I'll finally have an answer. In this house we watched Triplets of Belville a million times. Oh yeah, that's a great movie. That's a cool movie.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:34.992 --> 0:54:40.947]: 
  Oh, yeah, that's a great movie. Like the dog. Yeah, oh the dog's got like his eyebrows when he's like Yeah, his little tiny stick legs supporting his weight. He's so much like a real dog I always had like a thing for like old like movies where like people were brought into a cartoon world I always thought that was such a cool concept. Like a Roger Reb? Yeah, like I was really I like Rock-a-Doodle. You remember that? I like the beginning of Rock-a-Doodle I thought it was really cool. They're making Space Jam, too Like you know what I'm talking about? They're like brought into the world the second they're brought in and it's like then they keep going I'm just I don't care anymore. I'm tired of it. There's a recent commercial that Mike I think it's Mike did where there's like basketball players live-action basketball players and they put in animated Looney Tunes characters Yeah, and it's awful like the animation is acceptable But there is no physical comedy with the Looney Tunes characters. Oh, they just get like pushed on the ground Yeah, like there's no more like you know people going through black holes We're getting like a frying pan on the head and their eyeballs coming out or anything There's none of that shit they basically could have done That's just like a 20-year-old. That's just for babies I didn't see like and it was 2D? Yeah, 2D animation. I had a feeling the new Space Jam would have 3D like Oh, you can't get out of the Looney Tunes They're making a Space Jam, too They did though and it looks really good It's been on the cards for a while and apparently LeBron James is gonna be in it though. I don't really see it happening No, nobody knows who fucking- He's- yeah I'm hearing more and more about it like it kinda seems to be ready now Well Bill Murray being it. I'm telling you right now Space Jam was a product of its time. It's one of those movies Nostalgia sequels Yeah, I'm sorry to go back to this for a second, but Zach asked about good animated movies I watch a lot more shows than movies. There's a TV show called Galaxy High It's done by Chris Columbus who is like directed like the first Harry Potter movie Yeah, and like a movie called like the young Sherlock Holmes Yeah, it's like a stupid 80s cartoon about a boy and a girl that go to a high school in space And it's like filled with aliens. Loid in space But watch episode one if you want to see like an amazing cartoon that is super underrated Is it an 80s cartoon or 80s style cartoon? No, it's an 80s cartoon, but like it's actually funny and animation is beautiful It's like it's funny to me as an adult in 2016 Yeah The episodes after are not super good, but like for 20 minute short films It's like they've tried their hardest to make you good with a pilot, but they've like you know- Yeah, like hellbenters

 SPEAKER_04 [0:52:41.640 --> 0:52:43.446]: 
  Yeah, there's little tiny sticks.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:44.003 --> 0:52:44.864]: 
  as long as we...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:52:51.597 --> 0:52:53.520]: 
  Like a Roger Rebocat or something?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:52:57.368 --> 0:52:58.650]: 
  I thought it was really cool. They're making stuff.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:05.670 --> 0:53:06.109]: 
  There's a-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:19.592 --> 0:53:20.352]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:34.341 --> 0:53:35.016]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:39.994 --> 0:53:41.192]: 
  though and it looks really good.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:53:47.419 --> 0:53:51.233]: 
  He's yeah, I'm hearing more and more about it like a case. It seems like Bill Murray being it

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:53.477 --> 0:53:55.452]: 
  Nostalgia sequel

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:55.992 --> 0:53:56.532]:

  C'est...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:32.256 --> 0:54:32.459]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:54:46.279 --> 0:54:51.949]: 
  Put a date on it now. Right now. 2067. Here's a preview right here folks, just for you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:51.409 --> 0:55:06.630]: 
  Бездstyle<|fr|>shaped Кawarety ecos

 SPEAKER_04 [0:54:53.485 --> 0:54:55.459]: 
  I'm gonna First�� another video

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:07.862 --> 0:56:26.500]: 
  We're talking about shows that I just don't understand like I saw Code Lyoko How's that? It's this anime in air quotes where they have like these They have like the massive forehead Someone actually took a shot of like one of the girls and put the fucking entire theme song on top of her forehead It fit perfectly So they can if you can fit the entire theme song on the fucking forehead. That's how big it is like a light bulb But the whole entire show is just rehash of old French scenes that they like in the actual cartoon They did one episode where they explain how they go into like the like virtual world It's kind of like almost like this video game side to it where they go into this virtual world But they like read they use this animation of specifically where people get into an elevator They go into this factory and they repeat the same like 3d animation they had and it's like the same like weird plots Where like this like Xana guy infects something where it's like he may infected so all the doors are locked in the school It's because like a boarding school or he may make it so people can't leave the room like all the rooms are the same They keep going through doors so it's like weird like that and they're running into the elevator and he's like running after them And then he like calmly gets into the elevator because they were reusing the animation And then when they reopen it the animation he comes out all evil looking again But they use an old shot of him where he looked fucking normal And then they made him like calmly walk towards the thing and then immediately cut to him like running towards the stuff So they didn't even properly edit it. There's probably two hours of reused animation

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:11.507 --> 0:55:12.267]: 
  How's that?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:15.996 --> 0:55:16.755]: 
  Okay, they have the

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:40.077 --> 0:55:40.448]: 
  Mm.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:55:41.511 --> 0:55:42.017]: 
  But they

 SPEAKER_04 [0:56:26.500 --> 0:56:31.782]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:31.444 --> 0:56:41.721]: 
  I could understand it because it's more like harder probably to do like because I remember seeing like what? Like I was like a 30 minute thing of like the sword in the stone and

 SPEAKER_04 [0:56:40.574 --> 0:56:49.770]: 
  There is quite a few like walk cycles and dancing and like then I think they reuse the ambition for the snake and Robinhood and also yeah, there's only

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:48.859 --> 0:56:53.483]: 
  Yeah, there's only like five or six examples that everyone points out. It's not even that bad.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:52.133 --> 0:57:00.469]: 
  It's not even that bad. Is it purely done out of laziness or is it slightly like, oh, let's kind of have a little Easter egg, it's a little homage, you know?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:56:58.309 --> 0:57:05.498]: 
  It's a little homage, you know. I feel like you could go either way. It's not like family guy wants to treat it. It's just you're pulling out of a library.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:02.022 --> 0:57:02.427]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:05.245 --> 0:57:26.187]: 
  Not to like want to pat ourselves on the back too much, but animation is a huge baller. Sometimes you might want to take a shortcut. Like those movies are amazing and a lot of respect. To be fair though, the Sword of the Stone reused the animation in their own cartoon. Like they reused the same thing shot like that. But I never noticed until some smart ass on YouTube took different clips. Well, you probably did.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:14.560 --> 0:57:15.218]: 
  So

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:17.901 --> 0:57:18.458]: 
  the enemy

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:21.276 --> 0:57:22.002]: 
  No i nie bym ten!

 SPEAKER_04 [0:57:22.002 --> 0:57:22.424]: 
  I never know.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:57:23.875 --> 0:57:24.449]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:57:25.427 --> 0:57:28.448]: 
  Well, you called yourself an elementary, it's OK

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:27.182 --> 0:57:41.425]: 
  This is cutting corners doing full emotion rotoscope what a bunch of act It's not like it cuts to fucking steamboat willy and he's like pulling the sword out You know, it's you don't know this until some nerd points it out

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:34.152 --> 0:57:34.945]: 
  You know what I mean?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:34.945 --> 0:57:36.447]: 
  You don't know this.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:57:38.084 --> 0:57:44.361]: 
  Some notice like fucking listen, it's a good action. He's like use props to it props other things Harry

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:43.416 --> 0:57:46.437]: 
  Harry, did you ever take a shortcut in animation? You were like ashamed of yourself.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:46.437 --> 0:57:50.419]: 
  No no no no no no no no no no no no no that was a shame though really Um I don't think I'm afraid

 SPEAKER_04 [0:57:49.474 --> 0:57:52.461]: 
  I'm not even proud of like no one's gonna fucking okay

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:51.904 --> 0:58:04.476]: 
  Okay, this is kind of nerdy. I posted this before on Twitter. Basically, any time you see fire in a cartoon of mine, it is the same fire effect. The exact same one? Yep, the exact same one. I just copy and paste the frames. It works, you know?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:59.127 --> 0:58:00.004]: 
  Like the exact same one.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:04.476 --> 0:58:10.112]: 
  What if there was like a, you know, just you're in a cave and there was torches coming out, would you use the same fire out of both of them? Oh, what would you do with this?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:09.134 --> 0:58:28.439]: 
  What I would do is I would grab one I would flip one yes, I mean by about six frames Nobody's ever gonna know never gonna hear something crazy. You know the music video though Yeah, I know you too well music video. I did yeah, there was only 17 backgrounds Whoa except for like the part where like they point and that sounds like a lot

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:13.099 --> 0:58:13.437]: 
  안녕!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:13.437 --> 0:58:14.449]: 
  Offset the timing.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:16.457 --> 0:58:18.263]: 
  No, never gonna hear something

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:18.263 --> 0:58:18.735]: 
  Crazy?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:58:21.840 --> 0:58:22.465]: 
  Well, yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:58:23.781 --> 0:58]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58 --> 0:58:24.152]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:25.823 --> 0:58:31.965]: 
  Except for like the part where like they point and stuff. That sounds like a lot but that video is like crazy. Yeah. So there was a- Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:29.502 --> 0:58:57.885]: 
  Video was like crazy. Yeah, so there was a lot of... And also, the San Diego included finale season 2, there was only 60 backgrounds. So I reused like 60, think of 60, it was a fucking 17 minute cartoon and there was 60 backgrounds. Jesus. But the backgrounds were these huge scapes and there were just carved sections of it. I think that's what's brilliant about when you can take a background and you can swap it and flip it around. I do that all the time to save like stuff because when I'm like, I don't want to fucking redo this because it took too long. I'm just gonna take it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:45.685 --> 0:58:46.950]: 
  Yeah!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:57.885 --> 0:59:03.792]: 
  Used to do that shit too. With blood. It's a blood spurt that happened in every single cartoon. I like seeing the same thing.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:59.303 --> 0:59:00.552]: 
  It's blood.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:03.049 --> 0:59:23.147]: 
  I like seeing the same live action Bloodsport in like every... Action Essentials 2 That was the last video, yeah. That fucking weird. They never take shortcuts. I see movies with that now. I didn't want to get used to this like action essentials of Bloodsport 2. I know guys. They don't even like hide it well. It just looks horrible.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:04.619 --> 0:59:05.040]: 
  Like that?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:06.272 --> 0:59:09.529]: 
  action-essentials too.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:14.085 --> 0:59:16.448]: 
  I don't have a coin. I didn't want to get you to the coin.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:16.448 --> 0:59:17.494]: 
  He's just like, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:17.494 --> 0:59:18.507]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:18.507 --> 0:59:19.452]: 
  Number two.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:19.452 --> 0:59:23.991]: 
  They don't even like hide it well. It just looks horrible. You always see the same little...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:23.991 --> 0:59:54.130]: 
  rocks in the explosion coming out of the ground like they don't realize that light reflects off of blood no yeah it just looks like a flat image I spent like literally six hours trying to export a fucking animation of like when she shoots herself in the head and like a little gunfire on like the bullets and like the sailor moon second the second sailor man cartoon I spent like six hours just doing that alone just to export the scene where she like shoots herself in the blood splatters and it's just like that wasn't worth it that was stupid so I have to envy the people who actually sit there and do all that stuff so we all need

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:28.294 --> 0:59:30.927]: 
  No. Yeah, yeah. It just looks like a flat image. I see.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:53.185 --> 1:00:12.034]: 
  Yeah, we all we have it easy compared to the guys that do it on fucking paper Yeah Light, like cavemen We have it easy, we can order Chinese food in the end they have to like flip a thing and then like take pictures of it Could you imagine like the worst thing that could happen is flash can crash, which sucks I imagine like physically ripping and tearing something must be a huge pain in the ass Oh, yeah, they can't spill their noodles on it

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:56.492 --> 0:59:58.754]: 
  Yeah. Light, like, cavemen. We have to eat that.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:10.245 --> 1:01:01.360]: 
  Oh, yeah, they can't spill noodles on it. There's no chance of backup for you. I don't get how they like how they make it look like it's Underwater I like a giant piece of warped glass that to slide under this. Yeah, like hadron collider of a fucking I actually always think of that. Yeah, how do they make things look under water? I don't understand like old 80s anime stills like when you see an anime and then you see the stills of it You're like this was moving at one point. Yeah, every every still looks like a masterpiece like art Yeah, how do you paint this then you realize that they like sometimes cut corners? Yeah, but sometimes they cut corners will have a background and then they'll have a shade of brown It's slightly brighter. That's the crumbling part of like a ground or something They made fun of it in one of these like anime things But they actually like if you really look at an anime up close You could actually see where the painted background has parts that aren't fully done and they look like they're drawn on top of it But you don't normally look at that. That's actually really hard to

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:16.709 --> 1:00:16.759]: 
  MBC 뉴스 이덕영입니다.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:00:16.759 --> 1:00:17.434]: 
  I'm like a giant.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:19.527 --> 1:00:19.999]: 
  그럼 입니다.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:22.125 --> 1:00:26.024]: 
  I actually always think of that. Yeah, how do they make things look under water?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:32.267 --> 1:00:35.862]: 
  Every feel looks like a masterpiece like art.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:00:38.697 --> 1:00:39.844]: 
  We did it by hands.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:46.577 --> 1:00:46.999]: 
 avirus.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:59.959 --> 1:01:10.742]: 
  That's actually really hard to do like when I was doing backgrounds is like when people make backgrounds and they look all kind of They just look like splodges of color, but they somehow look great That's like harder to do than to make things look realistic to me

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:10.742 --> 1:01:58.769]: 
  bothered me even as a kid was when in like Scooby-Doo they'd be like what the monsters movie that's supposed to be shaggy dead shaggy they'd be like shaggy over those things a couple of like like like I don't know sarcophagus is or something like land up against the wall and one of them is clearly a cell and not part of that room I wonder where he is yeah yeah yeah there was a cartoon that like partied that word they drew the bush and it jumped out of the paint and won over what the fuck yeah there's an anime that like made fun like they finally they say like I'll don't worry it's not gonna move it's like part of the background yeah that's what I'm talking about yeah that's what I'm talking about and then the actual like the fucking pagan one falls apart and it looks beautiful it's insane it's the same in like Resident Evil where you're like like you can see the clock is like not part of the rendered background yeah you can see pixelated it's like a crappy low poly model or like that's gonna move yeah that's why

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:14.624 --> 1:01:15.079]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_04 [1:01:18.758 --> 1:01:23.787]: 
  I'm pretty good. Dead Shaggy. Um, for the decision. That'd be like, Shaggy over those things. A couple of like...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:28.799 --> 1:01:29.018]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:29.018 --> 1:01:32.190]: 
  I wonder where he is

 SPEAKER_04 [1:01:42.670 --> 1:01:44.492]: 
  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:44.492 --> 1:01:48.677]: 
  And then the actual like the fucking hell one falls apart.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:49.994 --> 1:01:50.314]: 
  seeprint overseas.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:55.056 --> 1:02:04.692]: 
  Yeah, you can see his pixie- low poly model That's why it's because it moves to the side Yeah, I think the character is hiding in a bush that he's gonna put his legs out and start walking in the bush Yeah, but I was-

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:56.946 --> 1:01:56.997]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:58.769 --> 1:01:58.870]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:59.984 --> 1:02:00.675]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:00.675 --> 1:02:00.844]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:03.780 --> 1:03:21.810]: 
  Yeah, but I was playing like the new Final Fantasy 9 with the HD remake for Steam Yeah, all the backgrounds are like these horrible fucking like 240p quality of like mushed backgrounds And whenever there's clearly a character in the background, he's just laying on the picture Did they not have normal like those images? They had uncompressed models? How they can't like... Can they not just replace them? No, they can't because at the time they made it so small It's kind of immersive in a way Yeah Like if you see like this like pixely shadow setting and you're like, what is that? It's gonna do something But how do you see like this super like HD monster in a corner? You're just like, oh, it's right there I can't miss it. There's no like artifacts blocking it when they zoom out far away So you don't have that PS1 charm Yeah, see the blend kind of Yeah, put a little noise grain over it all and it helps Yeah But when I see like something like Dragon Ball Z, I'm just like, they're painted over the background How does this... how do they... how do you do this? I got this panning sale of Dragon Ball Z when Goku first lands to fight Frieza It's like so fucking cool It's insane, but it's like on a painted background and then you like, you take the layer off Where he's c-comes onto the background It's just like what? I got that, I can show you later I love like, I would really like to see a documentary I've always thought if I had a lot of money one day I'd make a documentary about the people that like animation is outsourced to Like the basically a lot of them are Korean women That's drawn together, was done completely with Korean animators I want to see the lives of these people that just have to draw all day Like it's kind of gonna be very therapeutic

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:12.437 --> 1:02:13.821]: 
  mushed backgrounds and whatever

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:17.010 --> 1:02:18.293]: 
  Did they not have-

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:19.778 --> 1:02:27.051]: 
  They have these 3D models? Can they not just replace them? No, they can't. At the time they made it so small. It's kind of immersive in a way.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:35.387 --> 1:02:41.243]: 
  I can't miss it. There's no like artifacts blocking it when they zoom out far away. So you don't have that PS1 charm

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:41.243 --> 1:02:42.998]: 
  It's a blend, kind of. Put a little noise.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:44.247 --> 1:02:44.635]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:49.934 --> 1:02:50.474]: 
  I got this.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:55.705 --> 1:02:56.329]: 
  65How are you?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:00.666 --> 1:03:01.830]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:03.012 --> 1:03:03.400]: 
  I love you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:13.643 --> 1:03:14.605]: 
  That's trying to mean...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:16.950 --> 1:03:17.204]: 
  I don't want to see you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:20.494 --> 1:03:34.062]: 
  I actually saw an album on the internet of Korean animators and where they live. And they usually live in a bed and a tablet and they always have these things where they can lie in bed. There's not much room.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:24.949]: 
  internet of just like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:24.949 --> 1:03:26.282]: 
  like Korean animators.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:03:33.319 --> 1:03:37.082]: 
  There's not much room. It's so it's fucking depressing. Yeah, it's not a lifestyle.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:34.990 --> 1:04:46.945]: 
  It's not a great lifestyle. They get paid based on, I remember the reason, with Super and stuff, they were paid based on the amount of cells they made. So that's why, you know, like Dragon Ball Super was so crappy? They were probably like, I need to fucking eat. And it's like, rush through this shit. It's like $4 a cell or something. Exactly, they didn't make fucking beans on that. It's like robbery. It's like if you were animating and they were like, what could be $4 every minute of animation? But I'm getting like, if you spread the wealth just a little bit more, like surely all the best guys in town would want to get work here. It trickles up, right? But then it's weird because like you hire these animators, right? Like these big company anime people that like, you know, like Trigger and like Madhouse, they hire like, there's like a name for it. I don't know what it's called, but they hire these animators who specifically do fight scenes, or especially focus on those. And they give them tons of fucking money to do like these fight scene animations, like tiny like 15 seconds to look phenomenal. But they give them so much money to do it, and they give these people like this, like the people who do sell art, they give them like fucking nothing. Yeah, the anchors kind of. It's so weird. It's like the opposite. Like they clearly want to pay animators because Naruto costs like fucking millions of dollars to get their fight scenes in there. And then they do like, they fucking pay them shit for like the simple cells and stuff and like the old back in the days and stuff.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:44.170 --> 1:03:45.452]: 
  So that's why it's, you know, like,

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:46.988 --> 1:03:47.157]: 
  There.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:48.642 --> 1:03:48.945]: 
  some

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:48.945 --> 1:03:49.418]: 
  It's like right now.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:51.544 --> 1:03:52.320]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:53.890 --> 1:03:54.953]: 
  It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like,

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:59.914 --> 1:04:00.269]: 
  I don't get it.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:04.859 --> 1:04:05.905]: 
  It trickles up, right?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:31.605 --> 1:04:32.804]: 
  Yeah, the anchor's kind of.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:46.945 --> 1:04:54.994]: 
  On a side note though, did you ever see the How Popeye is Made video? Back in the 50s or something, there was like one of those videos where it was like, How Popeye is Made. And like, if you've ever seen it, you can go to the YouTube channel and watch it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:54.994 --> 1:05:00.597]: 
  Have you seen that? If it's like from the old Fleischer era poppies where they actually made a model of the background, those ones.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:59.905 --> 1:05:15.312]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, man. It was like insane. They'd like it's like not then we send it off to the printing process Then we send it off to the guy who does this then we send it off Like 40 people work on like one frame They just keep shipping them off to different departments and like huge big machines and shit pencil

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:14.586 --> 1:05:21.437]: 
  Well those pencil shadings are swept up by a brown fellow. He looks happy for work. He eats them.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:05:18.940 --> 1:05:32.001]: 
  I think we talked about there's a little Disney tutorial He's kind of walking to Disney Studios. He's like these pretty girls kind of the cells It's a little bit girls like I think some of you still be girls on the poppies

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:21.437 --> 1:05:21.876]: 
  There's a little

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:30.567 --> 1:05:33.705]: 
  It was girls on the Popeye as well coloring themselves. What was with this?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:32.001 --> 1:05:32.119]: 
  as well.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:05:32.997 --> 1:05:38.144]: 
  Yeah, I think I think there's also some real I was hearing about that there was like the concern of girls. Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:33.705 --> 1:05:33.891]: 
  I think

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:37.823 --> 1:06:55.448]: 
  Yeah, Disney passed around a memo telling them that the animators were all married men and that the Inconpane girls shouldn't No, I think it is. I don't think it's like it's all there I think it's cuz girls know how to color in between the lines. I'm I don't know how to do that They're probably more organized probably more like guys who do you big fucking a like you see girls like they're like It's like pretty pictures and guys are all fucking messy their lines everywhere. Yeah Yeah That's what me I can't color in between all my shits all if you really like zoom in close You give me a fucking f you mean f for my coloring then you see these people who like Prestigiously like color stuff. You're just like I can't do that not even a coloring book It's an amazing how many people and lost their jobs just going digital You ever see the video of the guys showing how they made an old painted panning shot Well, they have like four layers of glass all like it Like a photo with each other with the camera facing down and it's like okay guys Let's do it So like there'll be four guys with their fingers on each dial to the side and they'll twist it like one like you know Fraction or whatever and the glass will like move an inch down or whatever and then we'll take a picture and each person will have to do that Use after fact that's what I'm saying After effects look better Seconds dumbass What after effects came there like

 SPEAKER_04 [1:05:44.978 --> 1:05:48.269]: 
  I don't think it is.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:51.880 --> 1:05:57.938]: 
  I don't know how to do that. Yeah, they're probably more organized. They're probably more organized. You're just like, guys, you're too big fucking apes. Like, what do you see girls? Like, they're like, I'm just like...

 SPEAKER_04 [1:06:00.419 --> 1:06:02.697]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:01.658 --> 1:07:13.960]: 
  You can see actually in the first episode you can see like some of it they went digital halfway through the episode Really? So like you can see that some of it's like crappy paper animation Yeah, it cuts a really nice- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I don't blame them though Yeah They're stupid to deal with

 SPEAKER_04 [1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:07.227]:

 SPEAKER_04 [1:07:51.034 --> 1:08:00.062]: 
  When they're saying when they first start they have like a room full of giant computers just a process It would take like a week to just now they can do it on the fucking Apple the laptop you guys

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:59.202 --> 1:08:04.450]: 
  You guys probably talked about it before but that five days to add that entry is such awesome. So cool

 SPEAKER_04 [1:08:02.138 --> 1:08:12.752]: 
  That's such a awesome so cool. I love watching Troy Parker be like like go for like laughing think it's the best episode I've been miserable. Yes, like the day before is like this is the worst thing I've ever done I feel like

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:08.939 --> 1:08:29.948]: 
  miserable This is the worst thing I've ever done. I feel like that on all my projects. It's like stretched out. It's not five days It's like five months. Yeah, you see all the emotions in my that's usually after every project they do like I get on a project I sketch it I color it. I'm like it's looking good and then by the end of them Just like it sucks. There's so many mess. There's so many errors. There's so many mess. It's not even look good It's not gonna be interesting. Yeah, it's just

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:16.870 --> 1:08:17.950]: 
  Yeah, you can see all the above.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:17.950 --> 1:08:18.844]: 
  nd as you see

 SPEAKER_04 [1:08:29.390 --> 1:08:34.774]: 
  Yeah, it's a regular diagram until you buddy wants to watch how to use soft work. It's called five these two

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:34.352 --> 1:08:38.402]: 
  It's almost kind of like scary and stressful. It's not 6 days there. It's 5 or 6.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:08:36.209 --> 1:08:40.207]: 
  It's not 60 that they would... It's five or six, it's one of those two. Five doesn't work for a six.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:39.837 --> 1:08:46.165]: 
  What episode were they working on in that documentary? I think it was actually a bad one. It was a human centipede. Oh yeah, that's like one of the worst episodes.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:08:41.658 --> 1:08:42.959]: 
  I think it was actually a bad one.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:41.946 --> 1:08:44.444]: 
  It was actually a bad one. It was a human centipad.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:08:45.877 --> 1:08:49.319]: 
  Which you feel worse for because you feel hard it worked out. Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:47.345 --> 1:08:50.939]: 
  Yeah, exactly. That's the thing. It's like we're making fun of

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:50.939 --> 1:08:56.627]: 
  of like these like Phoenix Wright animators who are doing a horrible job getting paid four dollars per cell and you're like

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:55.952 --> 1:09:19.948]: 
  So they just came off Book of Mormon or like shit we have to do South Park So they're like, but it's like we're how do they fit in the episodes where suddenly there's like an entirely new style I know dude like the I think they kill themselves basically Yeah, yeah, they sometimes like do like some like fraffin advance. I think the good times with weapons whatever it's called Or they're heavy or the heavy yeah Yeah, I think they did those times Yeah, that was insane

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:56.627 --> 1:08:58.821]: 
  They just came off Book of Mormon or like shit.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:05.942 --> 1:09:07.274]: 
  I think they killed them.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:09:07.714 --> 1:09:08.001]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:08.001 --> 1:09:08.895]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:09:14.042 --> 1:09:33.330]: 
  Or the heavy... Or the major boomage one. Yeah, I love that. I think they had those times. Yeah. That was insane. They really hit the goal line with that. It's like everybody's always going, how do you make something look stupid and simple, but also get a content out frequently. Yeah. And they did something that looks cheap, but it also looks appealing. Yeah. It doesn't look shitty. And you can make a 22-minute episode in fucking five days.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:19.948 --> 1:09:20.269]: 
  They really did.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:32.723 --> 1:09:45.497]: 
  I wish I like nailed that style like I wish I had come up with that That's what you say, I'm jealous Yeah, I would love to find something that I think is appealing but is really really that simple I can't do it every time I try and do it. I'm like no that just looks lazy. It looks like I'm not trying

 SPEAKER_04 [1:09:35.676 --> 1:09:38.393]: 
  I'm jealous that I get to the first one.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:09:45.176 --> 1:09:51.841]: 
  Yeah, because I want to have yourself look either had your family guy, which is lazy in a different way. Yeah, tell us lazy

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:50.492 --> 1:09:50.846]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:51.741 --> 1:09:54.288]: 
  And it takes a lot longer to make. Yeah, it's the worst.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:53.192 --> 1:10:02.946]: 
  I want to know how much the anime is on Family Guy. The Korean people on Family Guy. I want to know how many islands made of gold Seth MacFarlane needs to buy.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:57.445 --> 1:09:59.200]: 
  I'm family guy.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:10:02.946 --> 1:10:19.129]: 
  People don't understand my beef with family guys sometimes but like if family guy came out of the gate looking bad I probably wouldn't give as much shit, but it came out of the gate looking pretty good It looked good. You go back and watch season 3 the characters move frequently the backgrounds are a little they're not using the light To it's a little bit messy looking they have a people

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:11.991 --> 1:10:13.172]: 
  Good

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:18.387 --> 1:10:55.950]: 
  They have a peeing. Remember that scene where Tom Tucker, the news guy, was walking in the hallway really slowly? Really slowly? It was like a million fucking friends. It's done on ones? Yeah. Whoa. It's nuts. The Simpsons is kind of doing a similar thing. I was watching on the plane over here some stuff from season 26. Actually, not super unfunny. I will give it that. Yeah, sometimes it hits. Yeah. Honestly, every new episode of The Simpsons I watch, I'm like, it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be. It's weird because you see a comparison. You see a comparison of the old one, and then you see it now. And it is a little more by the books produced. So you see the straight two frame, but it's still like they try to move more. I think the biggest hit also seems to be the same.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:10:19.787 --> 1:10:20.462]: 
  Certain things have them.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:22.656 --> 1:10:26.183]: 
  Really slowly and it's like a billion fucking frames. It's like it's done on ones.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:10:26.183 --> 1:10:27.128]: 
  Whoa!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:35.380 --> 1:10:37.590]: 
  Sometimes it hits.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:39.987 --> 1:10:44.189]: 
  as I thought it was gonna be. It's weird because you see like a comparison, you see a comparison of the old.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:49.791 --> 1:10:50.618]: 
  So you see like

 SPEAKER_04 [1:10:51.884 --> 1:11:07.071]: 
  But it's still like they try to move, they try to move more. I think the biggest hit, I'll say to you, if you actually look at how the country's moving around, they're not stiff, they move around. Yeah, much better. I think the thing that took the hit was the colors are a lot more bland. Yeah, the lines, the lines are less...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:59.292 --> 1:11:02.110]: 
  Yeah, they went around.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:04.962 --> 1:11:11.560]: 
  Yeah, the lines, the lines are less like prominent. They're very like simple like Yeah, these are too thin!

 SPEAKER_04 [1:11:08.944 --> 1:11:13.905]: 
  They're too thin!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:13.416 --> 1:11:34.493]: 
  All the lines are the same thickness and the characters look like they're made of cement There's no squash and stretch. No, like they are they look rock solid Well, like Homer man There's a shot in the Simpsons movie of like Marge like screaming or something like she spins around and her head Is this flip and it's from the movie? It's not from like that long ago and it looks so out of place because they actually Stretched Marge out, you know, they played there like you see

 SPEAKER_04 [1:11:20.993 --> 1:11:21.094]: 
  MBC 뉴스 이덕영입니다.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:32.924 --> 1:11:39.960]: 
  They played their like you've seen that comparison. It was like a the old Simpsons intro versus the new yeah, and Marge's hair

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:37.480 --> 1:11:47.453]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And Marge's hair, I mean, it's like a role-face. Yeah, yeah. Fluidity, and then the head turns. Her fucking head just turns. Her head road-face is like an action figure.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:40.720 --> 1:11:44.500]: 
  Like we're all in fluidity and then everyone is just a head turner.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:11:44.500 --> 1:11:53.376]: 
  I think they copied her head and flipped it. She's looking left to right. That's what it looks like. I had one in between. I had one in between. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:48.702 --> 1:11:49.208]: 
  네.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:49.832 --> 1:12:07.332]: 
  That's what it looks like. Yeah, just one in between. One in between. Yeah. I read actually a blog from the animator that did that and they said that the fist shake that Maggie does to the unibrow baby at the end, she didn't even animate that. Somebody else got a hold of it and was told to add the fist shaking so it's two frames. There's no in between. Was that the same blog?

 SPEAKER_04 [1:12:05.982 --> 1:12:13.896]: 
  Was that the same blog where the guy talks about how he gave any of the crows and they told him to take out freaks? Yeah, I also heard that another thing is like...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:10.994 --> 1:12:18.284]: 
  Yeah, I also heard that another thing is like they actually can't overly animate everything because like they're like no like yeah

 SPEAKER_04 [1:12:17.119 --> 1:12:26.991]: 
  like no like yeah I read a blog about us a guy who was like talking about anime crows in the the Simpsons intro and the guy said that looks too good take frames out yeah exactly he said okay and he took some out at least you get a better

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:23.903 --> 1:12:24.308]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:26.282 --> 1:12:46.853]: 
  I think you get better stuff if you just give it to animators and basically say this is your shot Keep it relatively on model make sure you begin and end the right poses for the next shot So they all line up basically and just give us good stuff Did you ever see the Simpsons and Family Guy crossover episode? Oh, no dude. No, dude. Actually. It was really good It starts off horrible. Yeah, I'm fucking funny. They're the end

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:31.328 --> 1:12:31.395]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:34.332 --> 1:12:36.947]: 
  line up and just give us good stuff

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:36.947 --> 1:12:37.285]: 
  Did you?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:42.702 --> 1:12]: 
  really good it starts off horrible it was so funny they're the end of it they give up and it just like fuck you both audience yeah I was just like

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:49.924 --> 1:12:54.143]: 
  Yeah, they were just like the funny shit ever. I actually have to say, they made it work.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:12 --> 1:13:03.947]: 
  It starts off, you think it's gonna be all made of work. On the animation front, they have like a chicken fight, which is not funny at all, but it looks really nice. They use like, these smear frames on things, which is weird and fun. I thought that was the funniest part.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:00.471 --> 1:13:55.450]: 
  Yeah, yeah, which is weird. I thought that was the funniest part. I hate the chicken. The chicken fights are horrible. You think it's going to be terrible because the first start of it gets so much better. I'm not going to give the pro-vac to see it praised, but the fight scene looks visually really good. Yeah, yeah, I might have watched that, actually. I think it gets good after, like, where he's in the bar and he's like, I'm drinking, what's the beer that- Duff? No, what's the beer that- Paul took a brewery? Yeah, Paul took a brewery, he's like, I'm drinking Duff, and he's like, this is our beer, and he like, peels off the fucking label and it says Duff underneath it. So it's like, you clearly the ripping off like Simpsons. It was all about how Family Guy rips off Simpsons, and how like they're clearly inspired from it. And so they were just doing riffs the whole time, and then they started fighting and really doing riffs. It was like, it was a part where he's like, you and your worthless daughter and you're fucking- You masturbating son. Yeah, your best friend said it, and then like, Homer's like, that's your kid. He's like, oh yeah, then he punches him in the face. And it's like funny because they're like being insulting the whole time. He's insinuating that Bart masturbates.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:03.947 --> 1:13:05.044]: 
  Take it away, though.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:13:05.044 --> 1:13:05.820]: 
  Horrible.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:13:07.761 --> 1:13:09.769]: 
  I'm not gonna give you so much better.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:13.397 --> 1:13:13.431]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [1:13:13.431 --> 1:13:13.448]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:20.569 --> 1:13:22.274]: 
  Paul took a brewery.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:38.794 --> 1:13:39.402]: 
  It was like...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:43.013 --> 1:13:43.502]: 
  You're next.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:43.502 --> 1:13:44.346]: 
  You're the best.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:47.485 --> 1:13:49.932]: 
  He's like, oh yeah, then he punches him in the face.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:53.374 --> 1:13:53.999]: 
  The你是

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:53.999 --> 1:14:00.445]: 
  We actually all sat down and watched it together being like, oh, this is gonna suck. I can't relax.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:58.926 --> 1:14:03.195]: 
  I'm not laughing. I'm actually laughing. Like, this fight scene is funny as shit, actually.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:14:00.445 --> 1:14:00.580]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:14:00.580 --> 1:14:01.154]: 
  Like this

  Speaking of like odd out of place animation there was a the Scooby-Doo reboot Look at what he saw it was called Mr. Incorporated. It was okay. Yeah, well I feel like it I was alright, but there was one episode where Scooby gets like sick or something the whole episode's done like the 60s style It doesn't look perfect, but it was a really interesting weird thing I didn't have to do yeah, it was obviously the animators the people who are working on the movie

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:08.781 --> 1:14:09.439]: 
  It was okay.

  like the Scooby-Heads against Steve.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:14:26.095 --> 1:14:33.992]:
