 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:00.497 --> 0:00:20.494]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:00:20.494 --> 0:01]: 
  Is a bunch of guys, is a bunch of bullshitter. You know, it's really fucked up. A couple days ago, I was walking up the street to the bank, and I saw a woman in a wheelchair, and she didn't have any... I don't know why I'm laughing. She didn't have any legs beneath the kneecap, so like she just kind of... It's fucked up. It's fucked up. You're dicked, dude. No, no, no, no. You're a funny stammer. You can't even get the words out of your mouth. You're laughing so hard. No, no. Just thinking about it. No, no. It's funny because she had like a newborn baby. Oh my God! Fuck you, dude. In my mind, I was thinking, how are you going to teach him how to walk? Oh my God! When you can't walk. But I didn't say it. I was just thinking it, and I was like, in my mind? It's easy. But then, you know... It's easy. You like get a stick and put a little bit of string on it and dangle them from it, and you make them walk. But I figured... Like a big marionette, like from fucking Team America. They're just like bouncing up and down while they walk. Stepa, what would you do if you saw her doing that? Yeah. Would you feel better? No, I figured if she just hopped out of her wheelchair and showed him how to walk on her stomps, and he did the same thing, they would pretty much be like the same height, and they could like hold hands and shit. You know what, though, to be fair, she could at least teach that kid how to crawl once he got to the right age. That's true. Ehhhhh! Mommy! He didn't even introduce the show yet. I'm sorry about that. Do as I do. Watch mommy! Welcome. Welcome to Poopulibin.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:23.211 --> 0:00:23.363]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:35.462 --> 0:00:38.415]: 
  That's fucked up. That's fucked up. You're dead.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:59.914 --> 0:01:02.024]: 
  in my mind, but then, you know.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:06.495 --> 0:01:08.065]: 
  But I figure, I got big m-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:23.995 --> 0:01:24.551]: 
  hands into my hand.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:35.689 --> 0:01:36.904]: 
  I'm so excited about that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:36.449 --> 0:01:36.955]: 
  What's that doing?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:43.688 --> 0:06:31.491]: 
  What? What the fuck is that? Sleepy-Catman, but you're... Oh, it sounded like one of those couch names at Ikea. Poop-Eleven. I don't know, they have some of the weirdest names. It's like, I'm pretty mad already. Leven-Scotten. Oh, it's fucking laugh. Cock-a-Cock-a-Doonin. Poop-Eleven. Sleepy-Catman. That's a reach if I've ever fucking heard one. It does sound like Ikea. It's such a fucking reach, it's a reach of fucking rounds. Stamper, remember when we first moved in? Stamper, remember when we first moved in and you helped me make my bed? Yeah. That was hard, man. Yeah, and we got it from Ikea and it was a big black thing that you put a couch under and you sleep on top. It was too close to the roof and I died. What? What do you mean it was too close to the roof? It was like pushed up right against the roof so when I go into bed I have to like... You need to have... I really flat. You have to like, ride out of bed every morning. You couldn't even like lift your knees up and... So if you had like a nightmare and you like woke up and shot... Yeah. Your head would just go right through the ceiling. It's the same fucking bed and sleep... Super slumber party. It was the same fucking one. We just didn't put a couch beneath it before Chris pissed on it. That was my room. That was my room. Yeah, I had to like slowly ride out of bed every day. Was that the top floor too? Yeah, it was the top floor. Did we introduce to show you? Very likely there were mice and or rats up right above your head. Yeah, you're always like one foot away from the rat. You just hear him like while you're trying to sleep it's fucking... Tell me about it. Just a humping rat. You fucking rat me. Hey, we're just here chilling and having a good time, no pressure. It's actually good to see you guys again. It's been a minute. It has been a minute. I don't like living in San Diego. I fucking hate San Diego. I hate California in general. I don't like the people. Why? I don't like the people. I don't like the weather. I don't like living on this yarn and yarn weekend. ALäänä TWąÖÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ I never had the deal with a fucking t zone! It's your brow and your eyes and your nose! Your brow and your eyes?! I'm a motherfucker with some chapped t zone shit going on. Quit acting like Asian people can't dry out or need lotion. I can peel my face off like a fucking scarecrow mask, man. I need lotion. Cause you're sleeping as fast as. What? You know what? That's right, it's because you drink and you don't hydrate. You fucking have a new layer of skin like a fucking snake. There is water in beer. There's a huge difference moving from a place like Philadelphia where it rains every fucking normally. That's true, right? And then you move to the fucking desert and it catches up with you later. You need to almost double up on your water cause you get dehydrated. You can dry out really quick. Stamper's just got a bunch of dried skins of himself just as decoys around the house. Like tarantulas. Like snakes too. They just leave their whole fucking body behind and dresses them up. But it's like loonitunes. I just like jump out of a skin and leave like my skin behind and run away. I prefer the weather here. Really? Yeah. Cause in Philly it was. I miss the snow dude. I fucking hated the snow. It was the worst part. Yeah. Walking in it. Yeah. I can't drive. I can't drive so I have to walk through it every day. Oh that's true. And you can't like bike in it. Nah. But you know to eat his own like I'd say like fucking 90% of the people I've met they move out to the west coast. Not even for like jobs and shit but it's like oh for the weather. It's like okay. And I can totally agree with that. But for me personally like I'd start to miss things like I don't really enjoy beef stew anymore because I always enjoyed it more when it was cold outside. Yeah. And like who's sitting around San Diego talking about oh I'm gonna get a nice cup of cocoa. Dude no. My biggest beef is fucking beanies and jackets and hoodies. Three of my favorite fucking pieces of attire. It's carbs too man. There's only like one or two months that we're you know like here in the west of the US. I have a fucking lot of nice jackets man. I can have at least like 12 jackets that are fucking awesome and there's no reason to fuck them around. But come summer time and come like late and like hot spring like even at night dude it's like 80 degrees. Yeah. It's fucking hot. I still I like the heat better than the cold. Oh Christ introduce the show. I think it was huh. Welcome. Oh you know what the truthfully the one thing I do like about I wouldn't say the west coast because I'm sure you can't keep saying the west coast because people like hey I live in Oregon. Yeah. I don't think anyone's talking about Oregon or Seattle when they're talking about the west coast. Yeah they're always talking about fucking shitty ass California and how fucking no no no everyone's fucking real down and real and fucking California. Who the fuck ever said that? No one's ever said that. Who has ever said come to LA we're down and real. I don't know maybe fucking Tupac talking about how California look like California. California. California look like California. No no California. California's right dude. That's my favorite part of the popular.

 迺

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:25.484 --> 0:06:25.500]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:27.441 --> 0:06:28.740]: 
  No, California.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:29.432 --> 0:06:30.006]: 
  That's right dude.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:30.006 --> 0:06:32.250]: 
  You're popular. Come to California.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:32.858 --> 0:08:47.841]: 
  No, man, California knows how to party. I had another thing on my mind. I was thinking about like fucking girls. I was thinking about like porn. No, but in the Southwest, one thing that I do really fucking like is there's no mosquitoes down here. Yeah. Never fucking chewing on you. It's because there's no water. I know, right? Because that's what you need for mosquitoes is standing water. Maybe there's tiny mosquitoes like serfing. Maybe everyone in LA just swindled serfs like shit. Was that? Everyone in LA just tastes like shit. Yeah, I would say if anything, the stereotype of people in LA is that everybody's fake is shit. That's generally the stereotype. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Because it's mostly the industry, right? Like everybody's trying to get an in. You know, even if you're a waiter, you're still slipping. Oh, yeah. We were on two different wavelengths. Yeah, I know what you're saying. If you're serving. If I didn't have the friends that I had here, I probably would experience that more. But because there are so many people just over the years that we've kind of like accumulated a group of people either from like the Newgrounds community or whatever, where it's like I don't even need to deal with a whole lot of new people. And the new people I have met, to be honest, have been really fucking cool. Because like you rolled out here, you had a group. You already had a fucking family. I wouldn't have liked it if I had. Right? Yeah. And plot twist. And you, I think, would have a better time in San Diego if you had more people that you could relate to that weren't fucking dropping off gifts like a cat leaving you fucking dead mice on your doorstep. Well, let me ask you this, Mick. Maybe you think that all these people are your friends, but maybe they don't feel the same way about you. You don't even think about that? That's depressing. He's absolutely right there, man. Yeah, it could be true. You're a little too loving. I am. You know, do you ever think that like when you're at home, like, oh, I fucking love these guys also? And then like those guys are at home, they're like, fuck, Mick is a piece of shit. I really fucking hate him. It's like, kill him. He just cares too much about dumb shit. You know what though? As long as I don't hear that opinion, I don't even care. Let us kill him. Then that would suck. Let us join forces to kill him. I mean, you're mean, Stamper. That'd be so fucked up if somebody was like, I've had enough of him. That'd be the worst. Stamper, can we talk about why you're so mean? Yeah, why are you so mean? I'm not mean. Stamper. And you just think I'm mean. You're a really mean person. I don't think he's that mean. I was kidding. But look at him. Look at you're real. Look at the real in Chris's eyes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:45.599 --> 0:06:46.881]: 
  Never fucking chewing on you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:52.500 --> 0:06:54.795]: 
  Maybe everyone in LA just was just like shit.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:56.871 --> 0:06:57.310]: 
  Yeah, I would say...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:05.089 --> 0:07:05.174]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:11.974 --> 0:07:16.514]: 
  Oh yeah, we're on two different waves. Yeah, I know what you're saying. If you're serving.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:35.363 --> 0:07:35.667]: 
  He's like,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:37.692 --> 0:07:39.852]: 
  I wouldn't have liked it if it had been.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:41.067 --> 0:07:41.472]: 
  That's you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:58.667 --> 0:07:59.511]: 
  everything about that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:02.667 --> 0:08:02.785]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:14.682 --> 0:08:16.437]: 
  I hate him, it's like kill him

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:25.347 --> 0:08:25.971]: 
  Let us join.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:29.886 --> 0:08:30.848]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:20.541 --> 0:15:53.125]: 
  I think we forget sometimes what it's like as far as the outside world and how people talk because even when we're in line, I love how that's the one thing you remember. What I remember about being in that line, there's these little kids, they're like fucking four and five right next to us. Like you could fart in their face and Stamper's just like, man, what the fuck is this bullshit? Look at this fucking mac and cheese. This should better be the bomb, man. My pussy better explode after eating this fucking shit. And I just look down at this kid. I don't wanna be like, Stamper, shut up, there's kids. But I just look down and this kid's got these big eyes. Look it up. Like you're speaking some alien language that's really cool. And you know what? That mac and cheese was fucking whacking the place. Listen, Stamper, okay? Before this podcast, you got all grumpy and said you wanted beer, right? So me and Stamper, we were like, did he do that shit too? Twice, twice in like 10 minutes, right? So we're like, we're standing at the crosswalk. We're walking up. There's a lady standing there, an old lady's on her phone. And I go, Stamper, why are you so grumpy? And he goes, because I'm not dating her. He points at her one foot away from her. He screams it in her face. She just looks down and pretends not to have heard. And then we get to a beer place. They don't have beer and Stamper's really fucking mad now. Okay, so he did it three times, okay? Dude, we were, you know, that's the story for nothing. What the fuck is the beer? Right? And the guy behind the counter is like, ha, oh, okay. And Stamper's like, what the fuck's the beer at? And the guy's like, go down this road. And he's like, God, he walks out, right? We're outside on the street now. And Stamper goes, what kind of fucking place is this fucking state? No fucking beer, fuck this shit, hell. And there's this lady just looking at him and went down and just goes, oh, sorry, bye. And she walks away. It's like three times. That old lady in the crosswalk. Yeah. You didn't even see, but as you walk by, she got real sad and she just fucking dropped to her knees in the middle of the crosswalk and laid down. She was done. You ruined her life. We were saying that if you say something in a voice where it seems like you don't care, they go, did I just hear that? That never mind. If you do it really quick and pretend like nothing happened. Yeah, if you pretend like nothing happened, they're like, did that? Yeah. And I like to think that she was like, I wish I was dating him. You could have done it. Yeah, I would love for her to put her finger in my mouth, dude. That's my new shit. If a girl could put her finger in my mouth, I'm done. I'm done, dude. Her finger, her finger would have been like those like fucking wrinkled sausage sticks, those slim gyms that you get at the gas station. Do you know where those fingers are? Cranly and bumpy. You know how much food those fingers are eating? Do you know how much taste is on those fingers? What if she had ET's finger?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:56.637 --> 0:13:57.615]: 
  You're cool.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:59.472 --> 0:14:01.935]: 
  This is the way. This is the stamper. Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:06.525 --> 0:14:06.779]: 
  Did he do it?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:34.639 --> 0:14:35.365]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:36.175 --> 0:14:37.744]: 
  You know, that's the story for another day.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:09.503 --> 0:15:09.604]: 
  she

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:15.696 --> 0:15:15.797]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:16.945 --> 0:15:19.206]: 
  Did I just hear that? That never mind.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:17.856 --> 0:15:18.075]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:19.814 --> 0:15:20.235]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:23.931 --> 0:15:24.454]: 
  And I

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:33.111 --> 0:15:33.955]: 
  That's my new shit.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:42.747 --> 0:15:45.025]: 
  You know we're all fucking like the Kremlin

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:47.505 --> 0:15:49.446]: 
  You know how much taste is on those fingers.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:50.189 --> 0:15:51.454]: 
  What is that?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:54.593 --> 0:20:30.010]: 
  Goes all the way down your throat. Would you still? Check this out you want a girl to put her finger in your mouth because like she wakes up that morning She wipes her ass wipes her junk off and like back to front lords So there's already stuff on her fingers already salty And then she eats like scrambled eggs and then with barbecue sauce on it for some reason because she's fucking weird And you can't objectify women like that stuff. Wow, bbq eggs. Yeah, of course. I know my favorite flavor That's weird. Of course I can Yes, all right guys, okay, we're reading questions. Yeah, shut the fuck up. All right, we got this is actually one thing I've never heard before though. Stand bar barbecue sauce. No more segue. I fucking eat knit shut up Yeah, absolutely ketchup on eggs. Yeah, anyways, go. Yeah, barbecue sauce on eggs first. Okay Question time from Reagan Brooks asks and this is Smith. Smith. Smith. BD BD BD BD. That's all folks You know how to say words, dude. Yeah, no, this is Hardballs man only do know I'm starting soft. Let's play lady. Here we go What can we expect? What can we expect from Chris and stampers music projects? Oh, you wanna go first? Oh, sure. Yeah, we'll probably make more music later. That's not a good answer Continue continue the end. I start to say man. I don't fucking know I'm so busy with other shit like I'm only one Do you have a bunch of music projects that you started that you ain't finished fucking it right man? I got a folder full of like 38 tracks. Yeah, that I haven't finished and they're for games rap songs I never finished fucking all kinds of stuff. You ever think about releasing any of that Oh, yeah, of course But you know you just need time like you can't like be a musician or an animator or like a full-time like it's feel I feel like music and like audio production is shit like that's like a full-time job Yeah, it is because you have to learn mixing. Is there the fuck me and you know what there's there's creating music and then there's like Audio engineering yeah, which is like a job in itself Yeah, people don't really understand which has always been the hardest thing for me is audio engine like does this sound good Like my levels are all fucked up and like yeah, yeah, I can't do that That's why you end up getting like someone to do like your final mix like DJ Cutman. Yeah, exactly I mean yeah, he could throw music together pretty good But he's got ears that I don't have and he always like just kind of like is there a music is there in some cases I'm sure every case is different, but in some cases, you know with animation you do the keyframes You have the character designs you've got whatever and then you can get other people to help you with in-betweens and all that Yeah, absolutely. Is there something in the with music absolutely so right? I think all the big movie composers. Yeah, they'll write something on a piano They'll have like they'll write out the score on on the sheet of paper They'll hand it off to a guy and now he will make it into a good sounding full song So that's just like a ghost producer, right? He's basically like doing like the melody and stuff or you know It's really common in a lot of other cases where you could throw together like say you do like a hip-hop instrumental And you like throw it to like an audio engineer and he's like yo these drums are fucking trash Yeah, you're like rip all the drums out replace them with better drums. You're like fuck that's fucking great Perfect exactly like that's really common Yeah, so would you guys ever consider doing that or the people you trust where you could take like the progress you have and be like You know what I don't even have time to finish this but you get the idea I trust this person to roll with these tracks the only thing I would trust people with is mixing Mixing mixing that's what it is mixing is so it's really really hard because it's insane Or if you if you have like a guitar playing you you can have the lows mids and highs and it'll sound fine by itself And then you introduce drums You'll have to remove some of the frequencies so the drums can come through you're doing like live mixing you're mixing like it's not Just like you do one setting and let it play every time you add something Every time you add something you got to tweak all the other instruments That's when you hear like easy ways of doing this muddy music. That's not clear and like things aren't coming out Yeah, you know like when you really like a song that you know like let's say like a Biscuit song or something like that. That's all it's my favorite song in the fucking world But then you see him in concert and that and just like this muddy messy shit Yeah, that's what music sounds like before an audio engineer comes through and makes it your favorite song because they balanced all the levels out They understand what the human ear likes. Yeah, like they study it auto tune is now, but it's a standard now, right? Like that. Well, I thought it's not standard. It's just one people like it. They use it I thought it was just like Have to be no, okay Just people do it if they want to be but Emma Watson was auto tuned. Oh, yeah That's because she can't sing in in beauty in the yeah, it sounds horrible Yeah, are you talking about that you beauty in the beast? Thanks, you see she's bell. Who the fuck is Emma Watson fucking Hermione? Is their last name Watson? Yeah. Oh whoops. What did you think it was Hermione? Oh, no, just Hermione dude. Emma Hermione Hermione Granger dude. That was your fucking game the end dude Emma Hermione sounds like a pussy disease

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:08.160 --> 0:16:09.544]: 
  It's already salty.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:14.252 --> 0:16:16.210]: 
  Can't objectify women like that, Stanford.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:17.745 --> 0:16:20.429]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:37.236 --> 0:25:38.451]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:42.434 --> 0:25:43.530]: 
  Anyways, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:11.442 --> 0:26:32.738]: 
  What would the plot be? I always wanted to like write a porno. Really? Yeah, shoot it. To make it funny? Yeah. I would love to hire two like really good... I'd like to hire two really good actors and make them say stupid things while they had sex. This is good. Oh, hey guys, I'm a black guy. I'm just normal.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:17.145 --> 0:26:18.529]:

  Well

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:46.930 --> 0:28:08.267]: 
  I already know what I'm gonna do if I ever do the porno shit. So check this out. So my porno concept is, and don't even bullshit guys, you pull up a porno that's 30 minutes long, you watch like the first 15 seconds to see if the people are kind of attractive. Yes. And if there's like no Mexicans in it or whatever. And then you skip to like the last like 38 seconds, just like to get to the end. Because I'm a busy man, I got a jack off. So all my pornos would be like, like 45 seconds long. And I'd call them quick dude pornos. And my plots would be like this guy comes in with like a business tie on a chain. He's like, okay. He looks at his watch, he's like, time to get the shit over with. And then boom, cum shot. Or you know what? Premature ejaculators like that, just for that. I'm gonna like corner a market with dudes who's got way too much shit to do. And these are like to come in like 30 seconds. Oh, I'm sorry, quote unquote, premature ejaculators. Like it's a problem that I'm coming too fast. Oh, I'm sorry. Am I grabbing the ball by the horns? And living life to its fullest. And you're not. Well, boo, fucking who? There you go. Well, psychiatry would snap. Oh, that was my black guy voice. I'm a black man who was raised in Asia. Cheating. No, because your accent is a product of your environment and not of your race. I would love to see a big black guy like that.

I didn't have my first kiss until I was like fucking 14, dude. My first girlfriend probably. That's my, that's my fucking story, dude. That's why I remember. Look, I was so focused on my quote-unquote career to be the best, like, fucking graphic and web designer in the world from like the age of like 16 of like 20. Like the first time I ever kissed a girl is like when I was fucking 21, dude. You're a liar. I'm actually not joking. You're a liar. I mean, I kissed my mom. She's a horrible kisser. She was my first tittie as well. But dude, I caught up like really quick. I was like, oh, no, no, but seriously, when I was like 19, 20, I was like, dude, I need to fuck. I need to like stop fucking around with this shit. Like I'm like working myself into an early fucking grave. Like I need to actually start like forming human relationships and shit. So yeah, like kissing a girl, fucking a girl came like super late for me. Like fucking a girl was probably like 23, dude. I was like, oh my God. And it was like, you know, it was fucking 17.

He's like, I'm sitting in, I'm in my car like I'm driving in like I'm he's in the passenger seat. He's like, oh, I got to go talk to my girlfriend real quick. I'll be right back. He hops out of the car and he's like talking to her for a second for a long fucking time. Actually, and then he gets back in the car and I'm like, what the fuck took so long? And he's just like put two fingers in my face. Oh God. And I was like, oh, what is that? I remember when that was a thing too, dude. You're like, yo, check this out. No. It's like really? And then like later on, you should have fucking taken your finger, show me up your asshole and been like, yo, check this out. I'll do you one better. From now on, every time I'm waiting in the car because some dudes talking like I got to go talk to my girlfriend real quick. I'm just going to like prep. I'm just going to pop my face. Because I know what's coming. Get them lathered up. I don't like it. Preparing ahead, you motherfucker. But do you remember the first kiss? I don't. I really don't.

Very sounds tart. I see the questions. Yeah, I was actually kind of getting horny. That might have been the first time I finally like legitimately understood that I was gay.

  It's a fucking bar when you're drunk, stop it. It's up his nose. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:31.020 --> 0:41:25.341]: 
  No, it's cuz I did that thing where I was just like oh it's kind of like wiping my face and then I kind of pinched my nose Yeah, and like I had but this is like a huge rock and I was like no way these motherfuckers didn't see that Niddy fucking tell me that you bastard. I hate it. I hate it because I'm like the snoddiest guy And I'm not gonna be the kind of the type of fucking asshole to go to the bathroom every three seconds to check Oh, dude, do I look handsome enough for the fucking world? But I need to know if like there's weird hygienic shit, you know like those like weird like crusty eyes you get in the morning When was the last time you got a big chunky brown scab cuz I used to hold on I used to get those all time the other one is last time I skinned my knee like a little bitch That green crusty snot that you see like that cartoonishly like you know what I mean Yeah, like slime green when was the last time I haven't gotten that or big like now when I bleed I just keep bleeding like I can't clot or something like that as far as the snot goes It's probably like last two three four times. I did coke

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:42.377 --> 0:40:43.575]: 
  You bastard!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:05.935 --> 0:41:07.960]: 
  That green, that purple.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:06.289 --> 0:41:06.964]: 
  That is shock.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:27.113 --> 0:43:38.485]: 
  You get like that though, like, you know what I'm talking about, like kids. Like, didn't we used to get like these big, gross, crusty snot? I do remember that, yeah. And I don't know why! You know, it was always like coming down. Everything was crustier and more. There's like fruit snacks and snot on everything. It's like a fruit black and white just like hanging on your face. Like a fucking frozen mosquito. And it's like cinnamon, sugar, and stuff. Yeah, I know, right? You go like walk up to a kid and just like peel like this face mask and just like sugar and cinnamon and graham crackers and shit off his face. Stop! Please! Anyway, hey Chris, I got this shit called um, because one of my biggest fucking personal veins like jokes aside is fucking nose hair. Yeah, me too! Because like so fucking fast, right? But you go on Amazon and there's like this nair hair remover. Yeah, I get that. You know how you got to do is like dry your fucking nose out and like kind of like melt the wax and the fucking microwave and then pop the plugs up your nose and pull out all your hair? Oh shit, really? What? It's fucking dope, dude. And those little things come out like fucking head. It's kind of like those biore shit you put on your nose and you pull them all out and say what? Awesome! But that's for your fucking... Does it hurt? No, not real. I mean, nair kind of like numb shit too. I use it on my balls most. You just pop that shit up your ass crack and just give it a good yank? Nah, you better fucking get feminine with that and go to a fucking lady. I got one of those like nose hair trimmer, the like chikwons. I did too, but then it just keeps growing back. No, but but those fucking hurt. It's not, it's not even pain, but it makes me cry really hard. It's like... Nose stuff does, I think it's like linked to your... It's like touching your like nerves really hard or something. At least it's faster than yanking them out with tweezers. That's what I do. Yeah. I just, you know what I do though? You get the good tweezers where you can get like five of them at a time and just foop! It's like shoving that nose trimmer. And you always find like another pocket like in your nose and we're like, where's all that confidence? Also, you find these amazing like these Jurassic hairs that look like they like went all the way up to your brain. They're like fucking like two inches long man, what the fuck? It's like how is that in my nose? I hate it. The fuck? And that nose trimmer, it's not actual pain, but like I cry super hard when I use it. Yeah, you need to check out that fucking narrative. Because when you pull that little plug out, it's like... It's like... It looks like a fucking Doctor Sue's character and shit. Oh wait, I mean like on your ball, yeah. And it says don't use on your genitals, but I'd do it anyway.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:33.357 --> 0:41:35.550]: 
  I do remember that, yeah. And I don't know why.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:43.060 --> 0:41:43.178]:

  Yeah, because everyone's like, oh, you should have. I'm going to be an artist when I grow up. I need to smack him across the face, be like, never say those words again. Yeah, I'm not.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:05.723 --> 0:55:25.260]: 
  Yeah, I'm not saying like you're playing piano every Friday. Okay. I'm saying if they're drawing pictures. Okay, that's really good I love it. That's it. Even if you hate it even if you hate it Yeah, you're a good dad. Yeah Well, they didn't specify whether it was a son or daughter, okay But I would say taking your kid out and trying to travel I know it's tough Especially if you're a young parent and maybe you don't have all the cash flow in the world But I think getting your kids to see different parts of the world and or your own country and or your own state I just to get out just to fucking go out and and Meet everybody. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah me Instead of one's a stranger wants to talk to your kid getting all fucking up to you about it No, let your kids go and talk to strangers. You know what I mean? Like go to that diner by the Grand Canyon and let your kid, you know fucking go talk to people Yeah, do that shit where like you go into a gas say we're out of rest stop you go into a gas station It's like you and your boy, right? You go into a gas station or you and your daughter You go into a gas station and you hand them your shit and you say go up to that man And you give him this money go to him and pay him for that was a thing that was a thing Yeah, no Shit because nobody even mentions that but when I was a kid I remember that too it was like hey listen you go into the store and you go buy the thing and like you know Monitoring you and stuff. Yeah, but I don't but that's not like a lesson I ever hear from anybody But I remember that being a thing that a lot of parents did do yeah No idea how much a soaks in just like learning how people operate and talking to people and shit My mom had edited the opposite. All right, so my advice is um, you have a kid that young don't touch his wiener or but Unless you Unless he's sexy If you got an ugly three-year-old don't ever touch it because it's probably like really fucking broke No, actually no truthfully, you know mine are like fucking dumb What one of the things that I would honestly say like you know I'm gonna put some thought into this later and I'd have a better answer But one of the things I would honestly say and like at the age of three years old I would say feed your kid everything. There's nothing worse than a fucking 30 year 20 30 year old is like he ass I don't like tomatoes. It's like who the fuck are you man eat your fucking tomatoes and shut the fuck up Like kid just feed him shit and let you know the only thing he eats his macaroni and cheese. Oh, no boo-hoo It's so what are you talking about? It's like three just slapping you eat them shit Yeah, so you're basically calling out Tom Fulp and his kids basic. Oh, yeah Like all his kids eat is like fucking chicken nugs and macaroni and cheese and he's such a soft-hearted asshole He's like, okay Tom stood up to his kids where it's like no you need veggies like fuck you dad and he's just like okay He loves his kids so much. He's such a faggot So precious and you're great when I said my mom and dad did the opposite I didn't mean they didn't do that Oh, I mean I mean they own a shop.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:18.953 --> 1:00:49.733]: 
  I was thinking of calling my new cartoon characters bloops and straws What were you asking? Okay, so I'm asking I was gonna say so I gave up a junk for a month, right? I was like losing weight and shit and then one day I cracked and I had a pizza Yeah, and because I hadn't eaten any like a diarrhea.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:51.944 --> 1:03:16.360]: 
  Yeah, you know what as a matter of fact I genuinely I think you're doing your body more harm than good by doing that But yeah, it's all like calories in versus calories out if you're eating more calories and you're burning or get fat Yeah, exactly right, but like pizza's not bad for you. No, it's whatever bread and cheese. It's if you eat too much of it Yeah, it's bad. You know what? It's weird still be a fucking bodybuilder and eat McDonald's no totally It's like just like work on people people are different with how they don't ban yourself from like no that I know I want to know this though. Let's say you get a slice of cake, right? Yeah And slice of cake the actual slice of cake weighs a quarter of a pound and yet I feel like you can gain like two pounds Yeah, that's because how is this possible?

No, but I'll start it's I forget if I was talking to you recently Character creation in Dark Souls The slider is back and forth But they're really they're talking about like oh bodybuilders know what's fucking taking steroids and shrink your dick It's like no homie. You can't build muscle in your dick like they're fucking massive and their dick stay the same size Yeah, so muscle is getting pushed out like past the base of their dick so their dick staying in the same time I'm just talking about like they get this means like the body is getting bigger and the dick staying the same size Lately same with fat dudes Right, yeah, you go to the gym for wiener day where they're like lift dude a legit way if you're ever concerned about Dick yeah losing weight. Yeah, that's the number one way to do it But at the same time like I feel like because I've lost so much dick is so tiny But because he's such a small guy it looks actually pretty normal No You're wrong stopper's gonna listen a monster cock.

  And I don't know, it's like, dude's bigalow. No, seriously, seriously, I was actually looking at my hard wiener the other day, and like the head of my wiener when it was hard is just like huge, and I was like, dude, am I losing fat around my wieners? Because I'm like so like serious. Imagine in front of a mirror with your head bobbed down, like your dick is like pointing up at your face. Just like a big red head. It's like a cartoon thermometer. It's like, dude. It's like, it's like fucking huge. And it's like, dude, I honestly thought, I was like, oh fuck, because it's like a Holocaust. When you're not eating, your body's just like, oh fuck. That'll just start eating into muscle tissue and shit like that. I was like, fuck, I think it's eating into my dick now. But not my dick head. I'm going to shrivel up into a match, and this is going to have a big head on it. And I'm going to look exactly like a fucking dried out Jack Skellington match and shit. Anyways, that wasn't the question, was it? Oh wait, what was the question? We're not answering questions anymore. We're not answering questions. Oh, OK. We're talking about junk food and squirts, but squirts. And you know what? We can answer one more question. I want to talk about sleepy cabin just for a bit. All right. Because this guy released a documentary on sleepy cabin, right? Oh yeah, yeah. You saw that? It was really well done, but it was misinformed. Which one? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The one where it was like a tribute to sleepy cabin. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the stamper. OK, I'll be completely honest right now. Give a history rundown of what started to finish really quick. It's like, OK, so Chris moves to Philly. We were like, hey, should we start a company? And it's like, fuck it, why not? And then we sat around. And at first it was boner cabin. And then it's like, oh, sleepy cabin. And then I remember Chris saying, yeah, that sounds comfortable. And then we did it. That's what I remember. And beside from running up the street, right down the street, we got an office and shit like that. Just because we had a lot of gear. So we and the stamper went from office to office. And we were in that first place. And we used to put blankets over the fucking heaters because there was no heat in there. It was like we were homeless. We had blankets over our legs. And there was a heater in under the blankets. Yeah. And the whole room was like freezing cold. It's fucking winter in a warehouse. Yeah. Fucking fire hazard. We're going to be really funny tonight, right?

  He like fell off the ladder backwards like fucking 15 feet dropped on his legs And I was like oh my fucking god. I feel so bad for you. He's on the phone like I don't think I can do this Because he didn't like fall on the ground like he fell on his legs Like straight like back and on his legs. It's like a man, dude It looks so fuck it's like that scene in the Simpsons if anyone if anyone remembers where like the guy was like in the Gymnastics and then he like flipped off and then like he landed and broke his legs and he was like oh, yeah But he's sad like a perfect 10 That's exactly what it looked like and then he's on the phone like talking to people like oh man Yeah, I felt like 25 feet and I was like business more like 12 feet He's like you have to exaggerate. I don't have to exaggerate 12 feet man That's really us a huge fucking drop Yeah, but you imagine just watching somebody slowly get pulled up And I'm like I'm trying to do the math like this isn't right like he's going up and oh there's ladder to which I'd like on some shit Imagine you staring at this whole thing happening with your hands still on the controls at any point in time You could have just said stop well No, that's the thing is there was another like situation that I had recently was like something I've never fucking seen or dealt with before and I was just like like it took me like a long time to Figure it out and when I finally got I was like wait a second. I fucked up. Yeah, weird I feel like if you were to see a giant tsunami coming your way Would your natural reaction be I need to go hijack a vehicle and fucking drive away or would you stare at it going? Oh my god, it's coming get the high ground when I was living in Hawaii They had these tsunami warning horns and they just like oh

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:35.618 --> 1:08:36.158]: 
  What is that?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:36.158 --> 1:08:36.444]: 
  He is a...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:39.077 --> 1:08:39.617]: 
  I'm like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:46.654 --> 1:08:47.497]: 
  What I love is that

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:47.497 --> 1:08:48.375]: 
  I just imagine you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:59.631 --> 1:09:00.238]: 
  can see, every step did the right thing, and now we face the problem.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:07.292 --> 1:09:07.562]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:27.255 --> 1:14:58.208]: 
  The way you were doing it sound like a cat doing the fucking like the Muslim prayer No, but here's the thing like the prayer the first couple of you know, you know weeks I was living there like my brother. He's like, yeah, that just happens You know, it's a tsunami like you know, we're testing it out I'm like, all right So if you motherfuckers do this like every fucking day how am I supposed to know when there's really a fucking tsunami like you too Do I have to look out the window or am I always gonna be panicking this fucking ridiculous? This shit was terrifying because they played that they blasted it constantly dude and the islands are small I always just think that like a big wave is gonna wash everything away and like everything's just gonna be gone Oh In the in the video. Oh, yeah, that's a good point. So I always um it was how it got started pretty much Oh, it was me and stamper at the beginning We wanted to just focus on shit We can make the because we just made super slumber party and stuff No, I'll tell you know what people always overthink things especially when it comes to this So they build stories and write fan fictions and when the truthfully like the truth is fucking stupid and simple like One of the biggest reasons that we started sleepy cabin is because we were running out of physical space in the house to store Our gear and like record shit So we needed like a plan. We're like, you know, fuck it You know, we'll just tie like kind of like a brand to it as well If we're like going out of our way to find office space Yeah, and build the sound booth and all this shit then fuck it like it was also that me and you like making Videos that are dirty and there's no where to put them and make money from them. That's true Yeah, that's why that was another huge reason why me and you wanted to do it But at the same time, you know, it's always like a simple answer at the end of the day Yeah, and then I really wanted to do the podcast and also people worry too much man He's gonna calm the fuck down. I know this is like, you know what niggas need to worry about their own fucking lives You know what I'm saying? I just wanted to give reasons because some people think that we started it to make money and then fuck off Oh for real? Oh, yeah, well fuck them man. Who's getting is it true? No? No, I don't why worry about who gives a shit man. You have to justify yourself on shit That's not true fuck that yeah, I don't think I don't know if anyone accused us directly of It's like you're faggot fucking bitch in the morning about that guy on fucking Twitter and you Stand for it just because I fucking care no Listen, I think I think it's so much more You know what an unnamed person decided online to talk about how artists complain about their lives And how hard it is and they used some numbers in terms of money that they were making and they were blowing it way out of Proportions all that was initially asked all that was asked was nobody makes that kind of money If you're gonna fucking talk to your fan base, which isn't small and you're gonna talk like you know You're talking about do one minute of research before you open your mouth. That was it I don't know go a thicker skin. You don't give some fuck dude Just because you know you're not about that shit I'm just gonna give you a shit about something doesn't mean you're better or doesn't mean you got thicker skin not giving a shit Doesn't make you any what that's something you agree with you've said it before a million times in the past You said artists and creative people are the hardest-working people you know Well then what's the problem with people defending it? It doesn't it's cuz Everybody says one thing Stamper's like man. Fuck you guys. I agree give a shit It's man. Look at all you getting your fucking titties in a tussle You know what you all need to chill life's a bowl of peaches. I got a big-ass spoon I'm gonna sit back kick back relax with this little survey says and you all You're the biggest contrarian out of anybody That is so me It's true Say that but then then you get off the internet you're mad. I agree. I think I think it went I think it went on too My it didn't went on too long Just you know what they say fuck fuck you and just move on no I agree I agree with that That's that's bad. That was basically my point like the thing with what is it like obsess over? But the issue with Twitter is is that there's always a delay So like somebody brings up something there's a problem They address it then all of a sudden their fans or their followers read those texts and all of a sudden There's like this long echo. You know what I mean Really quick and be like oh eat a dick. Yes, that's what I did Yeah, that's the only thing you need to have in your band to live either dinner eat a dick You did it big they should just make it emote for that. I don't write a retweet a favorite You just walk away. There's like a little tiny emoji with like a yellow guy and like a dick just going into his mouth Yeah, happy with it. It's bugs bunny with a fucking cock in his mouth Animators because they're they hear that their whole life. Yes I think that's what it is is animators of all people are probably more sensitive because Things like YouTube or from like clients who are like oh easily isn't it I mean Fucking sensitive and most artists is more emotional and they never shut the Lot of the time Most monotonous job possible clients don't get it. Yeah, they don't care They should be smart about it and just fucking let shit go. No, of course, of course I mean, that's the reason the natural the natural reaction would be look if we're already get fucked by people who undervalue What we do having some motherfucker who sits around playing with their dick acting like they're the fucking know it all the internet Start spouting off misinformation on top of all that all yeah, it's just like dude Come on. It was also at a time when everyone was like taking him really seriously, right?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:29.279 --> 1:09:30.749]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:34.495 --> 1:09:36.604]:

  I don't know

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:19.482 --> 1:12:26.012]:

  Also get the short end of the stamp.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:27.546 --> 1:14:28.491]: 
  Animators do the...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:30.314 --> 1:14:33.402]:

They were upset about you I love that No, you know one of the things that kind of bothers me sometimes is when somebody like it's up gets like really up in arms about shit for like You know seven days straight. It's like yes That's it's nor it's normally because they feel there's a certain amount of truth Yeah, I agree with that said and it's like just fucking let it go man if it's not It's doing it for seven days straight.
