I think it would be interesting. If you had a rain man ability, if you could have an ability where you could just, in your mind, you could think of it instantly, it could be anything. It could be a fucking math problem or a math equation. It could be like a- There's an artistic rain man. There's a guy who can go an entire city from memory. Yeah, like that kind of stuff. Yeah, I know that's what it's like. Like he's a pain. Like he's a memory. Yeah, I know that kind of stuff. And I was saying I would like- You know that guy? I know. I don't know. I've seen all his videos because I'm obsessed with autism apparently. He does like-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:06.359 --> 0:03:09.700]:

  Yeah, or they they fly him over a city in a helicopter that I can give him a few they give him like five minutes To jangle them from a rope. They just let him look out the window and then he spends the next eight hours drawing it on a wall It's it's like 99% accurate the photograph is crazy I said I would rather I'd like to have a photographic memory with movies where I could recite almost any movie from any period Because that I swear every time we talk about movies It's like an idiot because I'm on the side. I'm too busy my brain's clouded with Fucking a ton of Adam Sandler failure comedies and what would you would you have a trade-off there? Like you know Rain Man. He has like terrible social skills.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:41.430 --> 0:06:56.449]: 
  It's about the burgers. There's eight burgers. And that's where we actually, hamburgers were invented in Ireland and the reason why you put ketchup on it was to signify the blood from the battle of the blood of the cans. I was like, it sounds very far to shit on burgers. We would mustered signify. What's that? We would mustered signify. That was the blood of the yellow of the cowards.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:12.649 --> 0:07:23.196]:

  It's not really one.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:48.304 --> 0:09:48.777]: 
  It's very critical.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:50.481 --> 0:09:56.505]: 
  Disclaimer don't do this. Yeah, by the way like you pour like gasoline on yourself and catch yourself on fire

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:56.505 --> 0:10:03.137]: 
  I don't think we you take a knife and you're slowly pushing in your

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:00.505 --> 0:10:24.450]: 
  You got a huge hide. I mean I did stupid stuff. Like I did that thing where you basically strangled yourself until you passed out. You did that? Yeah, that wasn't smart, but I did it. In high school I used to do for free food. I used to let people faint me. So like I breathe in and out a lot. Yes, that's what it is. You bend over, you go, you bend over, you go. Yeah, yeah, and then you stand up and then somebody pushes up against your chest. Like really really hard.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:07.289 --> 0:10:08.048]: 
  You did that?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:09.499 --> 0:10:11.507]: 
  in high school I used to do, for free food...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:13.245 --> 0:10:16.064]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:25.109 --> 0:10:51.687]: 
  I did remember that but I never did it. You don't act sorry I'm sorry I wasn't actually strangling myself like a psycho. I'm sorry I do like me now. And so you do that. I was wondering how the fuck you do it. I'm like that's how I did it. I was just thinking it was easier to strangle yourself than just simply make it more creative. Like what are the most like goofy self harm you've ever done yourself? Like thinking it was gonna be funny. Yeah it'd be funny. You fucking pranked yourself. You got played. I got played.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:32.449 --> 0:10:32.500]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:54.235 --> 0:10:59.230]: 
  I drank half a bottle of Chloroceptic, and he bent me.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:58.386 --> 0:11:01.626]: 
  That is probably gonna top everybody. Really? I mean...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:00.495 --> 0:11:25.538]: 
  I mean hot sauce isn't cool. Yeah Yeah, I bet that's just like you just started fire at so just calling I don't know maybe you needed I mean maybe it's been a while. I don't know if you remember. I did it when I did it again I did it just to compare the memory of it. I did it right now I did this I should do it right now and let us know we used to just do things though We're just like we just play like the punching game where if you flinch you get punched Yeah, we used to play yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:02.959 --> 0:11:03.938]:

  I mean, I don't know

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:12.156 --> 0:11:14.974]:

  I did it right now. I did it right now. You should do it right now and you can let us

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:19.007 --> 0:11:19.497]:

  C'est comme...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:33.790 --> 0:11:38.447]: 
  Yeah, one time I thought it would be cool. I was more curious than anything else. Nobody dared me to

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:38.447 --> 0:11:40.439]: 
  to do it but I took a lot of

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:40.439 --> 0:11:56.942]: 
  lighter and I put my fingernail over the flame because I was curious how my thumb like like because at first like I didn't really feel much at all it fucking burnt the skin underneath my fingernail and it was easily one of the most painful thing the thing I remember you just weld your finger

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:52.082 --> 0:11:52.842]: 
  Fingernail.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:56.942 --> 0:11:58.005]: 
  Now to your finger.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:57.550 --> 0:12:13.480]: 
  Well, I don't it didn't really well eventually the fingernail like died But or the skin on it all kind of turned black eventually But yeah, I remember the thing that really got me was as soon as it started hurting I stopped and it felt like it was just getting worse and worse even after I didn't have a flame on it So don't don't do that. Yeah, don't do that shit

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:11.539 --> 0:12:26.676]: 
  So don't do that. Yeah, don't do that shit. I heard another one. There's this thing that people do now when they're really drunk to stimulate the drunkenness, I guess. They just whack their head up something. What? Apparently it makes you drunker. And I was like, that is the most retirement ever. Of course it does. You're crazy. I know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:20.972 --> 0:12:21.377]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:24.634 --> 0:12:29.106]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:35.417 --> 0:12:43.214]: 
  but it was pretty funny because You could do that without alcohol. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, my fingers started curling. I couldn't pronounce words. It was great.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:43.214 --> 0:13:22.448]: 
  I was at a party when I was maybe 16. I was standing outside the house with an empty bottle in my hand. I finished my drink. It's not even a thing that takes effort or skill. I wanted to throw the bottle in the air and kick it. I essentially did the Final Fantasy X Bicycle kick. I just went whoop! I did a full 360 flip and landed on my head on a ceramic flower pot. I got up and was like, yeah, that was great. I put my hand on my head and looked down. There was a cup of blood. I was like, we gotta do something about it. We went to the bathroom and someone like had passed me poured water on my head. Got like some salt and wine.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:20.777 --> 0:13:26.447]: 
  Salt. Nice. And just welded your wood shut.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:23.224 --> 0:13:50.477]: 
  Well did your mood shut? Yeah, yeah. They got some cotton wool and like tape and just around my head and put a hat over it and then I had the best night of my life. It was great. I was like, ugh. I did that in second grade, I had to go to the hospital though. See that's the thing, and I never tell my parents about it and they're probably sorry about this parents if you ask. You can still see the scar. I just like went on with, was possibly a concussion but I was too embarrassed to go home and tell my parents, it was a good night though.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:37.450 --> 0:13:38.310]: 
 沒啥時候了

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:50.477 --> 0:14:01.007]:

  Jesus Christ.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:19.064 --> 0:14:22.776]: 
  It is kind of, I mean it's not that heavy but it is still alcohol.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:22.692 --> 0:14:48.460]: 
  Well actually, it's like drinking soda and candy and then you're like, wait, this is actually really bad. You're like one of those guys that dies on his 21st birthday but you live somehow? I live and I just, every time I see you here, I'm like, hah. You're a coma. Oh, this is in your imagination. Probably. You know those things where like in a building falls on someone, their spirits, they're doing the stuff they were doing prior. So you're a ghost drinking nigger bombs? Yes, I was just still dying and then I came back and went and slept upstairs. Your ghost was still chugging alcohol?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:26.640 --> 0:14:27.501]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:41.592 --> 0:14:43.161]: 
  So you're a ghost drinking Giger?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:46.519 --> 0:14:53.320]: 
  Your ghost was still chugging alcohol. What are the biggest drugs in Ireland? What's like a really popular drug?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:51.480 --> 0:15:32.504]: 
  What's like a really popular drug? Well you guys call it Molly. Yeah, MDMA. I remember we were at a music festival and my friend took a pill. It was like a blue Pac-Man ghost. And he took it and he was having a grand old time. And I remember the main stage of the festival, we were drunk and he was on his blue ghosts or whatever. And then the music stopped and the guy walks onto the stage and goes, everybody, this is a public announcement. Someone has died taking the blue ghost pill. Oh my God. He did not take the blue ghost pill and he turned to him and was like, Sean, I don't know. Like he was having a great, he was probably fine. I was thinking to myself, he probably shouldn't have made that announcement because anyone who took the blue thing is now fucking okay.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:54.315 --> 0:14:54.754]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:54.501 --> 0:14:55.665]:

  Yeah, absolutely. That is the worst possible fucking thing you could have said. And I always thought maybe. So you took the blue pill. No, no, no. The first worst is if they were all doing acid in somebody's head. Hey, anyone taking those tabs of zebra skin? Be careful. Getting any like wacky, like you like smiley faces and peace signs on it? The only thing I got was just like a blue pill. It was a blue pill or it's like white. Yeah, no, they didn't come out first. Yeah, you didn't know any artisan drug dealers, Corey. I mean, they were created. They didn't hand me like peace signs and smiley faces. I'm like, where's that? We had like golden Buddha, dolphins and some other ones.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:37.212 --> 0:15:40.334]: 
  I always

 恭喜敬禮

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:53.682 --> 0:15:55.960]: 
  Yeah, no, they're coming out first.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:57.968 --> 0:15:58.440]: 
  I know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:58.440 --> 0:15:58.744]: 
  They were

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:00.651 --> 0:16:01.343]: 
  crafts

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:05.950 --> 0:16:07.317]: 
  They're always video games.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:06.068 --> 0:16:13.071]: 
  They're always video game related in Ireland. Oh really? It's like Pac-Man Ghost, Space Invaders, whatever it is.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:08.194 --> 0:16:08.835]: 
  Oh really?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:12.295 --> 0:16:17.003]: 
  Whoever ate the green Ouija head that was laced with poison, they're going to die.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:17.003 --> 0:16:24.276]: 
  That's why I could never read Luigi's head.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:22.487 --> 0:16:35.144]:

  I'm just denotating

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:31.515 --> 0:16:41.539]: 
  that's gonna take away life. We purposely... But ever since that I was like, I can never do Ecstasy because I'll definitely be the guy who fucking dies.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:41.117 --> 0:17:06.784]: 
  Well see that's the difference between ecstasy and Molly was that Molly was supposed to just be the MDMA while ecstasy was the mix of that with other shit And so it was that that unknown mix of things that made ecstasy so dangerous, but Molly should technically just be Molly I'm sure there are grades of it But it's not like oh this Molly happens to be laced with crack and this one happens to be laced with literal rat poison Yeah, look at that shit

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:44.324 --> 0:16:45.387]: 
  I actually heard them from my friend.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:05.459 --> 0:18:07.821]: 
  about Ireland. Oh, spooky ghost stories. Yeah, there's like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:13.575 --> 0:18:57.957]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a good one. There's a college near my town called NUI Maneuph in the town of Maneuph. And it's a really, really old college. And one of the big stories there is that on one of the buildings from the older parts of the grounds, there's a window that's always boarded up. You can always see it from the courtyard and it's always boarded up. And it was a dormitory that anyone who had ever stayed there killed themselves the next morning. But in the room? In the room? In the room. In the room. So, no, it's just like this one room. So, like the first person who stayed there was found next morning was throat cut from year to year. So, the next morning? Yeah, with the razor blade in his hand. This is the fable. Yeah. The next person who stayed there was found at the exact same way, throat cut from year to year with the razor in his hand. In one day? No, like the next time someone stayed there. Maybe the day after. Yeah, I'm just...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:36.779 --> 0:18:38.787]: 
  But in the room? In the room.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:45.908 --> 0:18]: 
  So the next warning?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18 --> 0:18:49.789]: 
  This is a fable.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:54.700 --> 0:18:55.290]: 
  in one day.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:56.860 --> 0:18:59.442]: 
  Maybe the day after. Yeah, I'm just saying, but like it only took a day.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:59.357 --> 0:19:06.951]: 
  Yeah, like I'm just saying most of the time these ghosts, you know, you get like a week Yeah, give you signs you start to see things out of the corner your eyes you hear voices something

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:00.167 --> 0:19:00.353]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:06.951 --> 0:19:11.406]: 
  Yeah, this ghost isn't fucking around walking the door and it slits your throat next

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:08.622 --> 0:19:10.832]: 
  It just walks in the door and it slits your throat.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:08.993 --> 0:19:09.870]:

  So he jumped in

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:25.986 --> 0:19:28.045]: 
  So he saw somebody who was doing this?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:27.893 --> 0:19:54.741]: 
  No, he saw what they say is like he saw like a dramatic face in the mirror and it imposed him to like cut his own throat and He jumped out the window to save himself. Why don't they just get the mirror away? Why don't they just take the razors away? Then the next morning they just got someone to say they took all this shit out of it And he woke up like like white hair they say and like he was shaking and like muttering and he was just crazy So they just boarded up the room and no one's ever say this Really? This is creepy

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:36.229 --> 0:19:39.419]: 
  Why don't they just get the mirror away? Why don't they just take the razors away?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:40.769 --> 0:19:41.123]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:48.970 --> 0:19:49.999]: 
  So they just point.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:51.501 --> 0:20:01.305]: 
  Really? This is creepy. Even if it's like, even if there's nothing there, even if you hear stories, but you just see this room that's boarded up from windows to doors, you're just like, I don't want to go in there.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:59.078 --> 0:20:07.836]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:09.996 --> 0:20:21.927]: 
  All the office I worked in, I worked in a video game, a computer games show, in a game studio a year ago. We all worked in this really old building and it was near the Guinness factory and it was all like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:15.874 --> 0:23:20.835]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:20.414 --> 0:23:43.937]: 
  Yeah, yeah, see I remember like if there were like I remember there are two of us there and we heard footsteps on the top floor like There's no one there like they have like big iron security doors that you need a key card to get through at that time So because there was two or three of us there it became more of like a summer party like yeah We get kind of excited when you don't know what the fuck it is. I was like I have to I'm not working anymore

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:28.109 --> 0:23:28.497]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:28.497 --> 0:23:29.070]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:43.279 --> 0:23:48.274]: 
  Did you hear it? Yeah, it was the rude stomping the closest you got to a ghostly experience

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:47.414 --> 0:23:57.758]: 
  We got I got I got talking and stomping so I heard people here like someone talking extra Lee just definitely no one here and stomping in the floor, but not not stopping just like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:57.657 --> 0:24:05.639]: 
  everybody yourself and you hear immediately run upstairs and be like I heard you I heard you like it against the door because I'm

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:03.614 --> 0:24:04.170]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:05.419 --> 0:24:10.212]: 
  Because that'll scare them. Scratch me! Scratch me! See you brother! Wait, wait, wait! Scratch me!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:07.815 --> 0:26:11.442]: 
  You're like, when you're in a moment. Scratch me, pussy. I can't. Your ghost adventure is the funniest shit. If we're talking about, like, you watch, he's like, OK, if we're talking about ghost stuff, there's a show called Ghost Adventures. It's like the fucking most hilarious shit. It's like the most over-the-top stuff. There's basically like these two, these three jockey guys. Plus one, there's kind of two, because one of them is kind of afraid. He doesn't like doing this stuff. It's just one of those ghost hunter shows. Yeah, but it's like really funny how they go about it. Because most people are like, did you hear that noise? And they go to, like, purposely, like, demonic places where people get scratched and, you know, like, hurt. And they walk in, and they'll go to a jail. They'll be like, we're the new, like, I don't know what you called it, but we're the new people who are watching over the jail, and come over here and fucking scratch us. Then they'll start rattling like jail cells. Like, come on, I ain't afraid of you. They'll just kick Shader, just knock stuff around. And they'll just basically antagonize them. They'll go around and knock shit over. And it's just really funny. Because you see the guy, the main guy, he's just like this fucking ripped buff guy. It's just like, I hate bullies. I'm going to show a bully what's up. And he goes to a place that's like, you want to pick on people? Pick on me. And he walks into people where people are murdered and stabbed and changed. Those shows to be fucking illegal. The shit they pull. Dude, that shit. They intentionally film themselves running around, like, 300 yards from the camera, pretending to be fucking ghosts, and like, oh, I saw something. It's fucking, it's funny, though. It's entertaining. Compared to the show, like, Ghost Hunters, where they have, like, 14 different camera men. And it's just like, did you guys see that wind? And the camera man in this one. Is it tongue in cheek, or are they really fucking around trying to be funny? I think it's probably supposed to be serious, but I can't take it serious because there's just too much coincidence and stuff happening that it's like, this is, this is T-shirts. There are so many. There's like eight of these shows, and that's all on like season 16. Well, the story is, is they're supposed to be like, they go to a building and they get locked in so they can't escape. So they're like, these people come up and maybe they don't have a lock, so they just like fucking like, drill them inside, so they're locked inside. And they're like, if we jump out, we're going to break our neck, because the only way out is like the roof. I still maintain that there were ghosts. It wouldn't matter how scared I was. I'd be happier than scared. Because the idea that there's some kind of an afterlife would trump any, any,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:16.185 --> 0:24:16.489]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:18.852 --> 0:24:19.155]: 
  What.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:19.999 --> 0:24:21.130]: 
  I'm gonna grab the most over the top.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:28.757 --> 0:24:29.550]: 
  It's just one of those...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:30.445 --> 0:24:30.884]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:13.645 --> 0:25:13.915]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:16.007 --> 0:25:16.362]: 
  I'm told.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:16.362 --> 0:25:18.387]: 
  They don't do that shit. They don't do that shit.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:30.199 --> 0:25:30.756]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:43.041 --> 0:25:44.762]: 
  This is TV. There are so many.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:45.707 --> 0:25:46.247]: 
  That's Persian music

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:47.074 --> 0:25:48.660]: 
  Yeah, did you have a lot of time to do this?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:50.500 --> 0:25:51.276]: 
  They go to a building.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:02.481 --> 0:26:03.494]: 
  I still maintain it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:04.439 --> 0:26:04.995]: 
  it would be

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:11.442 --> 0:26:16.589]: 
  kind of fear I had, most likely it's somebody breaking in and you know they're gonna kill you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:16.116 --> 0:26:24.807]: 
  Is there any possibility that like raccoons or shit get up on that roof? Bro, really? There's definitely some. Cause I've been sleeping on this couch and like every night I hear shit. This building makes some...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:19.390 --> 0:26:19.508]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:19.508 --> 0:26:20.993]: 
  Probably.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:23.254 --> 0:26:26.039]: 
  This building makes some crazy noises at night.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:25.617 --> 0:26:36.417]: 
  It was 5am last night and I was trying to sleep in the couch and it was pitch signs and all I could hear was... Ahhh! I turned out it was just you streaming over there. No that was you jerking off. Yeah. No.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:32.569 --> 0:26:34.442]: 
  I was just you streaming over there

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:34.442 --> 0:26:38.492]: 
  It's just jerking off. No, it is weird. All the little things that you get used to, I can't even tell you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:38.492 --> 0:26:42.998]: 
  I know sometimes, like I've stayed here a couple nights, sometimes that bathroom, the closest one,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:42.998 --> 0:26:46.913]: 
  The mirror is weird where it's like really late at night and it only happens at night.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:46.913 --> 0:27:29.944]: 
  If you look in the mirror, it actually looks like there's someone behind you with a razor blade up to your neck. It's really... It's like a weird effect of light or something, obviously. Do you have an urge to kill yourself? Did you jump out the window to save yourself? I did. I can pour it out. The thing I hate the most is when you have something like... There's a chair in my room. I hang like a shirt on it. I go to sleep. And every time you're waking up, and you see this silhouette out of the corner, you always think it's a fucking person! Yeah. You know it's a chair, it's been there for months. What's like the same thing? Yeah, it always scares the shit out of you. Every time I'm walking to Wawa's at night, and then I come outside, I think I see this little man hunched over, but it's the same fucking... It's the plush! It's the same plan! You see this, it looks like this black man who's hunched over and holding the bag, and you're just like, what the fuck is that? And then you come closer, oh it's a black man.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:54.321 --> 0:26:55.367]: 
  obviously but

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:56.937 --> 0:27:00.750]: 
  Did you jump out the window to save yourself?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:12.158 --> 0:27:12.462]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:22.502 --> 0:27:24.612]: 
  It's the plush.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:27.109 --> 0:27:27.784]: 
  You're just like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:29.944 --> 0:27:36.829]: 
  I've had that experience with you and Niall like separate occasions coming back from Wawa. I was like, oh that's the bush.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:36.053 --> 0:27:58.868]: 
  Yeah, no exactly. There's also another bush up here that looks like a guy's like peering over It's like a fucking like like a mailbox hidden behind something. You're just like what the fuck dude? Looks like a nosy neighbor. No, it looks like a guy's like behind the bushes when you're coming by looking and it's just like Oh, that's that's there's the nosey bush. I didn't notice when I get really tired I see a lot more things like the tire der I get the more things I start to see that's where like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:45.300 --> 0:27:46.296]: 
  Das ist es.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:45.503 --> 0:27:47.410]: 
  It looks like a nosy neighbor.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:52.455 --> 0:27:52.911]: 
  I didn't know

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:57.062 --> 0:27:57.315]: 
  Oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:58.142 --> 0:28:01.197]: 
  That's where like shadow people come from. Yeah, your peripheral vision

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:59.999 --> 0:28:16.283]: 
  Yeah, your peripheral vision. Yeah, it's all on the peripheral. When I see like things moving I'm like that's just my fucking cuz I've stayed up for like four days I know weird fucking movement. I'm just gonna say weird purple blocks floating across the floor You're like that's not that shit with headphones You know what I mean like all of a sudden there are fingers crawling up your back. Yeah, it's just

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:07.272 --> 0:28:09.432]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:15.507 --> 0:28:25.665]: 
  Yeah, I have a weird thing with headphones where if I'm alone in my house, or if I know I'm alone, I can't wear headphones. I'm too nervous. So I don't think I could ever own an Oculus Rift or anything like that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:19.827 --> 0:28:23.910]: 
  Or if I know I'm alone, I can't wear headphones. I'm too nervous. So I don't think I could ever...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:25.294 --> 0:28:30.441]: 
  I also can't have my back facing my door. Yeah, both. I can't. I'm so proud.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:27.758 --> 0:28:27.944]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:27.944 --> 0:28:47.080]:

I didn't know other people had it the fact that you were saying I feel like I find comfort. Yeah, I do. I thought it was the only one who had that issue

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:30.441 --> 0:28:31.842]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:36.482 --> 0:28:40.684]: 
  Yeah, Jeff you are fearless. I didn't know this was a thing. I didn't realize this was a thing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:46.439 --> 0:28:59.449]: 
  That's my like I that's on like I'm so uncomfortable the idea of owning any of those VR headsets Like someone could just break in and I would be immersed in this fucking video game And they'd just steal all my shit and then stab me they'd be a little bit in that order

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:56.007 --> 0:29:05.052]: 
  They'd be a red aura around them. They'd be like, you're a bad guy. They would tell, they would give you the color. I guess the only logic is somebody couldn't break in that quietly behind me. They'd have to.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:59.449 --> 0:29:00.090]: 
  I died.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:01.103 --> 0:29:01.694]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:21.664 --> 0:30:30.844]: 
  There was a time before iPhones. There was a time before the internet. Do you know how people made phone calls before cell phones?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:27.503 --> 0:30:38.455]: 
  It's always been around. Do you know how people made phone calls before cell phones? They knocked on each other's door and handed them letters. They cupped their hands over their mouth and went, Oh! They take a cup with a string of hands. Yeah, that's why people don't stop, man.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:32.920 --> 0:30:34.439]: 
  They cupped their hands over their neck.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:37.004 --> 0:30:42.707]: 
  That's why people in the top-end, she's existed. Good. We cut their hands and we're like, Hey, hold on, stop!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:39.265 --> 0:31:12.441]: 
  I was like, hey, hold on, stop! It's not hard. It was to make a long distance callback. And then they used to scream so loud. Well, you needed a good horse to carry your buggy. It's like, yep, those are good old days at mailing. It's like, those weren't good days. Nobody, no, yeah, those weren't good days. The good old days. You get robbed by like fucking. But our life expectancy was half of what it is now. You banded to come up to you and rob you of your, and they just kill you because you don't have anything worthwhile. Just mail it and steal your own things. You had 20 kids because you knew 17 of them were going to die. And only three left to work on the farm and maybe one to carry on after you. The good old days.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:42.707 --> 0:30:44.614]: 
  I've never wanted to make a long distance call back in the day.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:46.234 --> 0:30:46.673]: 
  Tchau!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:52.292 --> 0:30:53.440]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:53.440 --> 0:30:54.452]: 
  Those weren't good days.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:57.507 --> 0:30:58.401]: 
  When our life is dead.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:58.992 --> 0:31:00.089]:

  and only three left to work on.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:12.441 --> 0:31:22.549]: 
  You were ready to go out and really all they'd do is hand you a shotgun and you'd walk out into the cornfield and kneel down in front of the harvest moon and suck on the end.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:19.157 --> 0:31:19.934]: 
  in front of the harboring

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:20.912 --> 0:31:25.452]: 
  suck on the end. That was nice. It was a good old days. It was a good old days. It sounded like Benz.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:24.254 --> 0:31:28.742]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:28.050 --> 0:31:30.987]: 
  Right you were thirsty, but you couldn't drink the water because I got

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:30.649 --> 0:32:25.139]: 
  Cause I got some weird fucking disease that eats away at my skin and I'm like, oh I got, oh dang it, that means I'm gonna die in three turns. Oh my fucking lens popped out of my face. Anyways, I hate bullies. Your face was beautiful. They bully, bullies want to scratch me, come scratch me! Come scratch me! Bullie me! Bullie man!

  He's the devil! He's the devil himself!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:25.847 --> 0:32:43.769]: 
  Are the ghosts talking through them or are they just hearing voices? Voices in the dead and have like electromagnetic voices so you can only get them through like voice recordings. They're listening to like this processed voice. But they're using like a box that cycles through like radio frequencies. But it's funny when you hear like this, it's like this loud like.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:32.378 --> 0:32:32.952]: 
  Oh

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:23.010 --> 0:34:25.896]: 
  He goes to flag you with the fucking miners You know people are

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:25.187 --> 0:34:30.402]: 
  You know people are always gonna find a way around it. People are always gonna find a way to be assholes.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:30.317 --> 0:35:15.458]: 
  I think this though is trying to like gray out the people who are clearly fucking being mean for no reason Yeah, well and celebrating them in monetize I guess you know that's the biggest thing is like let's say you're an advertiser and You're a company and you're advertising on Google, right? So let's say you have an ad and it's running and it runs before some video where they literally just make fun of autistic people It's like well now your product technically, you know, it's being associated with that and as a company You're like well wait a minute Google I didn't know when you said hey you can advertise on your YouTube platform that my ad for the anti-bullying campaign Literally ran before 30 minutes of some guy playing Call of Duty making fun of

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:34.688 --> 0:34:35.920]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:48.120 --> 0:34:48.373]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:08.117 --> 0:35:25.853]: 
  like what you were saying? Otters. Otters. Otters. You were saying that uh... Otters? Adorable little otters? Hold hands? Out! How you were saying that uh this new rule will probably affect everyone except the people that already have an audience because of it. Yeah it's hard.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:25.482 --> 0:39:27.942]: 
  Yeah, it's hard to- I'm curious. I'm not even that curious. I don't watch these fucking people. It is a weird culture. It's like some of these people are looked up to. I don't get it. I don't really like parose with YouTube and stuff. I just look at certain videos and that's it. I don't really explore beyond what I'm used to seeing in my subscription. So I haven't really explored. But for some reason I catch stuff. I catch the wind of things and I'm like, oh, this is happening. Yeah, I don't know. We were talking about the other thing about YouTube today is how these people that they almost have a dual personality. Oh yeah, fucking in particular. I mean, I like the guy, but he's fine. He makes like just just more of an observation. He makes insane videos like this. The iDubbbz guy. He, he, first of all, he made a video where he's eating a pickle on a fucking sewer. I'm not sure how he was able to sanitize an inside section of the sewer and swim through sewage water into a little. Now, did he bring the pickle or did he find a floating pickle in the sewer? It was floating in dirty water and he took off his pants and he got in his underwear and he was crawling through fucking tunnels and like swimming into it and picking pickles up and eating them out of the jar. See, and I feel like that's like dangerous. Wait, there was a jar of pickles in the sewer? Both. He does weird shit. Like he'll just like someone will send him pain. He's like, thanks, I'm going to eat this now and he'll eat the pain. And he's like, thanks for the dildos also. This is the duality of YouTubers. They almost have three percent. There's like normal, super autistic mode and then there's like smart guy mode and they whenever, you know, they, you know, they talk to him in real life without a camera and they seem normal and then they film something autistic. But then somebody pisses them off and they have to do the quote unquote serious video and then like they put like a masterpiece theater pipe in their mouth like, listen, this is what I'm going to, this is how I feel about this particular subject. It's a culmination of the real self and then also their most artistic side combined. Yes, but they seem kind of sharp and you know, kind of with it and a little insightful and I'm like, okay. And then next week they're back to eating sewer pickles. He's rolling around eating the fucking baby naked in the sewer eating pickles. But I'm like, I thought this guy was like, like, what is this guy doing with this? Like, the first video I saw that guy was him talking normally. So I was shocked when I saw him rolling around like a baby in the sewer. I'm like, so this is what he normally does. Well, he does things or he's a personality and he is entertaining. When he does this stuff, you're just like, this is really gross. Like the idea of someone swimming around in sewage and eating pickles and then just spitting them everywhere and being like, this is good pickles and fucking pouring pickle juice on your wounds. You're like, pouring pickle juice on your wounds. He's like, I have an open wound on my plunge. You know what helps open wounds is pickle juice and he pours pickle juice on his fucking wound on his foot. And he's open wound from walking around the sewers. I mean, fuck E. Coli and every other disease. He's gonna get technists and some other shit. I probably went to get a shot prior. I don't think he's a complete idiot, but it's like, still don't swim around in sewers that have like, especially water sources that haven't been used in like years. Pickle swimming, like don't knock it to the, I mean, I used to play in sewer. All kids played in sewers. It was a fun time. There's that sewer. Like we had that one like long sewer where you could see the end of it with the light. So you go to the end of it and then there's like the other sewer that's dark. You're like, okay, we're not going to go to that sewer, but we'll go through the one that has the hole. Now here's the thing. When you say sewer, some people are going to think like there's literal logs of shit. No, it's like one of those like outdoor like drainage. It's like a drainage. The one we have is it was like a highway or underneath. There was like a pipe that took you to the main pipe area. And it's just like this long abandoned pipe thing that has like the dip where it had like, now like trees and shit have grown inside of it. But it's like, it was one of those pipe things. We had one of those and we used to play in it, but the pipes were like, probably as big as like half that fridge over there. So it's almost like, I want to say like four feet tall. So you could still go through it, but I was little. I wouldn't do that fucking nonsense now because I don't have spiders and shit. I was a great kid. What food did you eat in the sewer? I didn't eat. You're guilty yourself. I was, you know, I put my clothes on. I wasn't going to walk through the sewer and step on possible glass and like bugs and shit. Will this cringe stuff ever go out of style or do you think I'll just keep getting bigger?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:30.089 --> 0:35:31.101]: 
  I don't know, but it is

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:50.541 --> 0:35:52.043]: 
  Yeah, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:56.987 --> 0:35:57.325]: 
  Oh, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:19.532 --> 0:36:20.612]: 
  find a floating picture.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:21.422 --> 0:36:21.709]: 
  It was

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:31.784 --> 0:36:32.999]: 
  Wait, there was a jar?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:32.999 --> 0:36:33.623]: 
  Or people's hotels.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:34.703 --> 0:36:35.091]: 
  Both.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:40.879 --> 0:36:41.588]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:49.418 --> 0:36:50.295]: 
  And they ate whatever.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:12.250 --> 0:37:12.874]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:29.462 --> 0:37:33.597]: 
  The first video I saw that guy was him talking normally.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:32.264 --> 0:37:32.331]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:36.010 --> 0:37:37.461]: 
  He does some pretty much.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:54.437 --> 0:37:56.952]: 
  He's pouring pickle juice on your wound.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:56.952 --> 0:37:57.947]: 
  He had him here and he's like, I can't believe it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:57.947 --> 0:37:59.415]: 
  It's like a Bible passage.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:11.987 --> 0:38:12.966]: 
  I probably went to get a sh-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:22.399 --> 0:38:25.690]: 
  Yeah, pickle swimming. I mean, I used to play in the suit at all machines.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:27.833 --> 0:38:28.491]: 
  until you went to the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:28.491 --> 0:38:29.385]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:35.805 --> 0:39:40.412]: 
  I feel like cringe has always existed but it's only been labeled as cringe in the past like three or four years.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:39.822 --> 0:40:37.045]: 
  Yeah, I guess you finally have a word for it. Like 700 years from now they're gonna look back on the history of what used to be America and they're gonna look back at the beginning of cringe as like the beginning of the downfall of America. Chris John's gonna be in the temple of $10 bill. Return back into like... I don't know if it's coincidental that like the rise of cringe into popular media along with presidential candidates saying pee-pee-poop-oo at each other on Twitter are somehow kind of like this culmination of signs. Like you know before it was like the birds migrating the wrong way. Like we're headed. Yeah, like it raining frogs. I feel like there are signs right now of like this ultimate like all the social awareness shit that's just so out of control like the appropriation stuff of... The chapter, the book book of autism revelations. The circus. Locusts, cringe. Yeah, like there's something really intense going on where people are all... All the power lines everywhere. I turn people into retards.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:36.150 --> 0:40:41.129]: 
  The new leaders of cringe are going to be the horsemen of the apocalypse. It's the chemtrails. Chemtrails, of course.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:38.496 --> 0:42:59.942]: 
  It's like chemtrails. Chemtrails, of course. What is in chemtrails? Just condescending. Chem. Condescending. Maybe they're condescending towards each other. Everybody already does that. No condensation. Condensation. Well, I mean, like what is it? Is it like psychotropic drugs? Like what are the chemtrails supposed to do to people? They make them stupider. What are the retards out there that they think chemtrails do? They make you stupider and unaware of what's going on. It just makes you dumber. The government's flying around making you dumber. The government already has mass lots of land. They want to be king of a dumb country. Mass graves dug. They have plastic coffins that can fit at least three bodies. Why do you think they have rainbows? They are stacked around. They already have a list of names. They already know who the New World Order was written on a rock. If there is an aluminum die. They don't. I seem like they don't have a very good plan if this is indeed their plan. To wipe out the human race and put them in a champ. Some people out, make people dumber. Infertility. The highest it's ever been. They need the 1% to live. The 99%. They're waiting. They're just waiting for the right presidential candidate to get in office. And then they fucking push the big red button. They systematically take our guns away. And then once we have no more guns, they're going to fucking roll through our streets with tanks. And they're going to fucking... When you finish your sentence. Obama, when he blinks, he's two sets of eyelids. Guys, wake up. He only blinks while giving a life. Prince of Prince of God. In 120p. I was on this GeoCities webpage and it told me the entire truth of everything. I'm getting scratched right now. I fucking ghost. Listen, there's space jellyfish. You don't get it.

Colloquial, I think it is. Colloquial or colloquial? I can't say it. But the important thing is that we all know that he's what he said.

  Caloquial, Caloquial, Caloquial, Caloquial, Caloquial, Caloquial Kings Locally, it's just like the word where you say like something, although like a meaning where it's like so if you called, if for instance like Blue Moon people would call like um, there was a colloquial name for it They would just call it like like moon water dumb autistic shit like that. Oh, thank you. Yeah, like you drink a moon water So what's that? Oh, it's Blue Moon. It's a colloquial term. Yes, colloquial This is a colloquialism is definitely like it's like a phrase or saying yeah, it is it contextual to a society That's what I was saying, but I yeah, no Jeff is colloquial Jeff is Oh, you got it right now characteristic or of or appropriate to ordinary or familiar conversation rather than formal speech writing informal It's just an informal word for something. Yes, so Kory was coming but but it's it isn't an informal word But informality is based in the context of a specific group of people, right? So what one would consider like the common usage of a word may not be what one other group Like what huck has become like like a fetish Right, actually, I was gonna say like Tart in England, right? Yeah, or bird a bird. Yeah, yeah, okay, this is for women, right?

So I arrived in New York and I go, alright, I don't know what to do.

  So I went.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:37.759 --> 0:52:40.392]: 
  There were lipstick marks all over your plate.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:38.924 --> 0:53:20.892]: 
  All over your flight. Seven in the morning, and they told me that, we'll be gone in the morning, so you can just leave whenever you want. I was like, okay, kind of. So I wake up at seven in the morning to, one of the guys was walking into my room in the fucking nip, like stark naked. What? He walked past me as if to be sleeping. The other thing you do when you're staying over in someone's house, they're like, they're mom walks in, you're like, oh, pretend you're sleeping, but you're peering in the corner. All he does is he just walks in, not even seeing you, just waltzes in, gets his clothes, gets dressed, and leaves. And I was just like, all right, that just fucking up. And I was like, okay. And then I gave about 10 minutes, or I was like, oh, it's on my phone. And then, I don't know why instinctually I did this, like I heard someone else walking towards the door again, so I was like, but they're gonna pretend you're sleeping again. Same thing happened with the other guy.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:52.542 --> 0:52:52.913]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:00.692 --> 0:53:00.945]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:27.945 --> 0:53:43.994]: 
  And apparently empty rooms with a giant TV. What are you gonna score this? Yeah, I need to leave my airbnb review They did exactly what they described like it's not much it was $40 for the night. So I mean I got my money's worth

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:34.324 --> 0:53:34.493]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:35.084 --> 0:53:35.674]: 
  Go ahead.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:40.703 --> 0:53:42.458]: 
  So I'm in I'm sure that factors

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:43.555 --> 0:53:45.445]: 
  I'm in the thing you said you didn't know

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:45.445 --> 0:53:48.111]: 
  In fairness to them, they were very polite.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:47.774 --> 0:53:51.503]: 
  Yes, they didn't murder you. They didn't rape you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:49.495 --> 0:53:58.439]: 
  They didn't rape you. They did walk into my room naked, so there was a second where I was like, that's it, I'm dead, that's the end. It's the end. I'm gonna text my mom right now. I know you're worried about my trip.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:58.439 --> 0:54:09.914]: 
  But like it does have to be kind of freaky like to wake up in a strange apartment in East Harlem with two Turkish naked dudes It was there is probably that moment of like this very real

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:08.985 --> 0:54:13.440]: 
  I was planning on just not telling this story to like my parents. They're probably gonna hear it

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:13.440 --> 0:54:16.461]:

  You can make it up to me, I still like you. You're pretty sure it wasn't your fault? Um, fuck you though. Uh, no. But no, I stayed in Long Island for a while with some friends and had a nice time and I had a good time. It's been my trip so far.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:51.788 --> 0:55:53.374]: 
  Uh, no.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:58.994 --> 0:57:37.425]: 
  My trip so far. Is there anything you want to talk about, Jeff? I don't know. Someone feel you said anything. You said something, because I was kind of quiet. No, you said something. Swiping my last episode. The whole time? I don't know. I don't know if I'm doing it on the finale or not. Oh yeah, Jeff. This is Jeff's part of the... You better be on the finale. We're gonna give you a speech. We're gonna give you a speech. To the delight of some in this trip. How has it been? How has your trip become an experience, Ben? Yeah, it's been a great trip. I was sleeping again. I'm gonna give you a little breakdown. Wow. I've been like a roller coaster. An emotional trade rift that just keeps crashing and crashing. It was kind of fun and carefree at first. And then fans started caring about the podcast a little too much. Getting a little... Some of the... Most 99% are totally fine, but there's that 1%. You're just like... That's true. There is that 1% that just they push the boundaries. They don't understand like they're the people we're talking about when we make the podcast. They're either socially awkward or outright just terrible people. Yeah. Yeah, it's just... That was a good spectrum. You know, I'm not... This isn't my first ride on the internet. I understand how the internet works. I already put out a bunch of shit on the internet before this podcast and I already knew how people can be. So it wasn't like eye-opening me. Yeah, it's pretty much except the fact that once you put stuff on the internet, you're gonna be scrutinized. And you need to deal with it. If anybody calls you like... People are just like, named calling you, just calling you a faggot. You're just like, well, I guess it's a faggot. I already had a thicker skin now than I did before, but it's... Do you think the internet helped you? Yeah, dude. Through skin? Yeah, yeah. What's weird is, what bothers me is co-telling, writing on fame. Man, I did Sonic through the anime series. That's my fucking call to fame. Corey. And I did a bunch of goofy, stupid cartoons about spreading asses and farting. So it's like, what the hell did I do? Corey. People are acting like I fucking... I stepped on people's toes to get where I am. It's like, okay. Corey. All right.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:02.250 --> 0:56:02.740]: 
  I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:04.124 --> 0:56:04.208]: 
  it's

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:04.208 --> 0:56:07.634]: 
  I guess I was kind of quiet. No, you said the whole time. It's my last episode. I don't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:09.557 --> 0:56:14.350]: 
  Oh yeah, this is Jeff's car. You better be on the finale. We're gonna get a good bye. We're gonna get a good bye.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:15.194 --> 0:56:16.358]: 
  How's it been?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:18.113 --> 0:56:22.450]: 
  Yeah, I was in my sleepy guy and he was still breaking down. Wow. I didn't like that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:25.892 --> 0:56:26.618]: 
  It was kind of fun.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:36.675 --> 0:56:38.920]: 
  That's true, there is that one percent that just...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:40.607 --> 0:56:41.181]: 
  and like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:43.004 --> 0:56:43.830]: 
  They're either...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:47.155 --> 0:56:47.526]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:48.994 --> 0:56:50.749]: 
  That was a good spectrum.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:59.305 --> 0:57:01.009]: 
  You have to pretty much accept the fact that

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:09.042 --> 0:57:10.139]: 
  I guess I'm a baby. I already had a...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:12.417 --> 0:57:13.986]: 
  Do you think the internet helped you?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:15.488 --> 0:57:16.450]: 
  grow that skin

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:16.450 --> 0:57:18.272]: 
  Yeah. What's weird is that we're...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:24.246 --> 0:57:24.685]: 
  Corey.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:35.687 --> 0:57:41.745]: 
  Cory, do you know what 50% of the comments are in my last cartoon? What? This is fucking Igor.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:41.391 --> 0:57:52.191]: 
  You're after South. Yeah, you're after. We're really you're after. Your style doesn't look like you're after South. I think it's because the interruption points to the internet. That's it. It's just a cartoon on the internet.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:42.859 --> 0:57:45.070]: 
  Yeah. I loved it. Teasure it like you're wrapped.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:46.825 --> 0:58:04.645]: 
  I think it's because it's a cartoon on the internet It's just a cartoon on the internet. No, it's weird, right? One of the biggest I get called a hack all the time and like red and shit It's like bye One of the one of the biggest ones is that um I like e-grap to and he's like you're stealing e-grap to style of smooth animation and I was like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:04.949 --> 0:58:38.969]: 
  That's just... That just means you're good at animating! Not only that, but if anyone actually fucking knows what any actual Aaron made cartoon, he was very famous about not doing particularly smooth animations. Yeah, he's exactly special stuff. Yeah, he's the post-opposed, right? A lot of it. I mean, the stuff through Yatta, which a lot of it, he didn't even... I mean, he may have done some of the character designs or something. Some of them, he didn't even do that. He commissioned them to do it. But a lot of the newer stuff he's just commissioning, because like Aaron's doing his own thing with Rocks. Yeah, absolutely. He can't focus on fucking Star Ball.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:17.335 --> 0:58:21.672]: 
  He's exaggerating special stuff. He's still the post-depose, right?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:29.654 --> 0:58:30.683]: 
  He commissioned them to do it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:35.155 --> 0:58:36.336]: 
  Yeah, absolutely.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:38.175 --> 0:58:40.504]: 
  We already talked about just the fucking idiocy

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:40.504 --> 1:00:06.111]: 
  Fucking people who can't read or have a fucking original thought and that was like I was talking about when Corey did the star bombs Street Fighter song yeah, even though in the title in the description I was I did it on the part the last podcast you and then also Aaron says it like Hear him say it before the song and still every fucking sheeple idiot Just opens their mouths and lets this drivel pour forth and it's just why are you even alive? Why are you wasting everybody's time by being alive and typing? I mean I was a little bit mad but I'm very right to be mad Did a ghost bully you? A ghost? A ghost has been scratching my butthole This is ghost- Egoraptor stuff You know pouring salt on my butthole More than any personal insult could be but yeah, it's like more it's more so the the comments that people that think they know What's going on? That's what it is So I get it because People who really think that they know what the fuck they're like they're fucking critic Yeah, they literally are just this pathetic useless jobless friendless people But we only call them people because we're obligated to call them people What are we talking about? They're just numbers Piles just piles they are they are useless sex I'm glad I'm present for this episode Honestly hashtag numbers

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:47.895 --> 0:58:48.891]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:14.440 --> 0:59:14.997]: 
  It's very right to be mad.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:19.452 --> 0:59:20.447]: 
  This is ghost

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:32.496 --> 0:59:33.475]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:46.384 --> 0:59:47.447]: 
  A week has gone by.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:46.941 --> 0:59:50.012]:

  I'm glad I'm present for this episode.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:04.424 --> 1:00:07.950]: 
  hashtag I'm glad I've been present for the

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:07.950 --> 1:01:29.997]: 
  This is nice. For me, it's more just simply like, just do a tad bit of research. Like before you start splirting stuff, just like look into what you say, or you just look misinformed. Cause if you just do an ounce of research, you can probably see that I've been helping out with the game for the last year or so. I've only talked about that only. I haven't discussed anything else. We're in a, I've been incredibly busy for years. Yeah, I mean, we work like 14 hours every day. And it's just kind of like, you know, we're not just, you know, YouTube wasn't my career. I wasn't like, YouTube is going to be where I focus all my efforts on. For me, YouTube was just like, well, I can express myself on YouTube and people follow me on there. It's just unfortunate what's like YouTube's algorithm and everything, but it's like, I don't even give a shit. Like for me, right now, at this moment, I do not care about making a YouTube video. All they care about is getting this fucking game done within a few years. So we don't have fucking the next seven years to work on this and fucking kill ourselves over. I think we have a really great solid fan base. I think a lot, a lot. No, no, no, I do. I do. I think a lot of people are really shit smarrying numbers. You know who you are. No, I think we do. We're great fans, but we also, before I wasn't even talking about our fans, I was talking about YouTube people, in general, just YouTube commenters who watch videos and are breastfed until they're 25. Just, you know, in general. But I think there's a difference, the difference being when people act like they're entitled to something, you know what I mean? It's not just a matter of like, oh, I'm wrong. It's like, no, I'm right and you're wrong. I know more about Quarantine.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:25.889 --> 1:00:26.699]: 
  We're in I've been in

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:28.032 --> 1:00:30.327]: 
  Yeah, I mean, I can vouch they were great

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:32.470 --> 1:00:32.942]: 
  the Lord.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:32.942 --> 1:00:33.516]: 
  man.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:38.190 --> 1:00:38.444]: 
  for me.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:50.459 --> 1:00:50.796]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:00.600 --> 1:01:04.937]: 
  No, no, no, I do I do I think I don't really shit smear numbers, you know, no

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:04.937 --> 1:01]: 
  I think we do.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:29.997 --> 1:01:31.937]: 
  Corey and Jeff and what they're doing.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:31.937 --> 1:01:33.135]: 
  Oh boy

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:32.275 --> 1:01:39.227]: 
  Oh boy. I think that is just a general message for anyone who's... A loser. Who puts shit... This is just the opposite of that.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:38.181 --> 1:01:45.876]: 
  This is on the opposite end. This is the no bully hour by the way. No bullies.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:45.674 --> 1:01:49.454]: 
  This is a message for all those ghosts out there that are getting bullied by the bully ghosts.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:48.897 --> 1:01:52.440]: 
  Come at me. Stupid fucking ghost. Come scratch me. Give me the fucking mark that's on your face.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:52.440 --> 1:01:56.727]: 
  If someone's leaving a bad comment on your shit, like, like, like, you're really hateful comment.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:54.989 --> 1:02:51.199]: 
  You can haunt them. You can haunt them. I understand, like, A, yeah, we can take, I believe, we're mostly nice people that can take constructive criticism. Yeah. And at the same time, a lot of these people being constantly on the internet are probably just having a shitty lives at home, and you almost guaranteed they're having some kind of shitty life somehow. How else could a happy human being act like this on the fucking internet? You know, if you're actually having a good time in life, you're not, like, angrily typing on, like, dark little message words in the corner of the internet. Mmm. What the fuck is Corey doing on that podcast? I think some of them, too, like, that's almost giving them too much credit. Like, maybe. I think some of them are just so dumb that, like, they just think that everything they say is right. Whatever it is that makes... Like, they're so out of it. Whatever it is that makes teenagers fucking know it all. I don't know what it... I don't know what... Like, oh, my parents don't understand shit. So, you know, they have a lifetime of experience. Like, I don't know fucking anything. I don't know, you know, they're wrong. Yeah. No, you're wrong.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:11.965 --> 1:02:12.437]: 
  감사합니다. 감사합니다.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:14.985 --> 1:02:15.002]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:15.002 --> 1:02:15.120]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:16.065 --> 1:02:16.487]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:23.339 --> 1:02:23.440]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:23.811]: 
  Hmm.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:36.299 --> 1:02:39.167]: 
  is right.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:46.204 --> 1:02:47.504]: 
  experience

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:47.014 --> 1:03:01.122]: 
  I don't know fucking anything. I know you know they're wrong. Yeah, no you're wrong I'm so thankful for the fact that I didn't have access to message boards and shit when I was like 13 or 14 Yeah, cuz I would have been one of these assholes I might have been a cunt on the other side

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:56.262 --> 1:02:56.903]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:57.882 --> 1:04:53.729]: 
  I might have been a con on that. Imagine if your inner child, imagine if that part of your psyche, the psyche that told you that you were right and everyone else was wrong, that teenage mindset and it didn't get worked out of you through your teachers, through your parents, through your life experience. Instead, you found a corner of the internet where everyone thought the same thing as you. Oh my god, how empowering is that? Finally, people that understand me. Oh my god, you don't have to. Tumblr cringe compilations. That's what fucking happens when all these pre-view-bessing people who aren't full human beings yet start their hormones start kind of happening. They're discovering sexuality. Like everything's at like a million miles an hour. I admit Tumblr invades Vine is pretty funny. Yeah, but that's how you, but then imagine seeing everyone going through it. I would have never thought like, oh my god, this is a phase or oh my god, I gotta grow up or oh my god, I'm actually an impetulent child who has half an opinion based on my emotions and not facts. And when we're having a bad day, let's endlessly attack a podcast that people listen to for two hours every week, but attack them, sound like we fucking hate them. Yeah, well, still listen next week. My comment was about YouTube, not our fans. I like our fans. Plenty of our huge amount of our fans are totally cool people. I'm gonna say something about you, Rans. It's what you said, and I agree because it only happens when like the fucking moon is right, when like some freak is awake and he'll come onto me and he'll say something out of the left field and I'm just like, Who the fuck are you? And then it's just like gone. Like I fucking- You know, they'll say something and you sit there and you're like, and they probably like a smirk on their face like they're being clever. They bested you. But it's like, you know they're being the most socially inept retard on the planet, but they're smirking like they just said something smart and funny and they have no idea how fucking socially retardedly inept they are. And with that one sentence they said to you, you're just like, you must know they have no job, their parents hate them and they have no future. Yet they think they pulled one over on you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:24.325 --> 1:03:26.265]: 
  Oh my god, you don't have to.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:26.265 --> 1:03:26.282]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:36.289 --> 1:03:37.538]: 
  They're happening, they're disgusting.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:40.525 --> 1:03:41.234]: 
  It was an hour.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:46.212 --> 1:03:47.545]: 
  Everyone going through it?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:10.174 --> 1:04:10.225]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:12.992 --> 1:04:14.190]: 
  I'm gonna say something.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:16.806 --> 1:04:17.228]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:25.564 --> 1:04:27.657]: 
  You know, don't say something.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:41.325 --> 1:04:42.507]: 
  Yeah, I'm fucking s-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:42.507 --> 1:04:44.380]: 
  socially retardly and eff they are.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:55.905 --> 1:05:19.851]: 
  And I have to say, I feel so pity, I can't even respond. Yeah, I don't be collected and respond, they think they won the argument. Well, it's more like for me, like if I get in a scuffle with someone, they'll be saying stuff, and I'll be like, okay, they'll be like, yeah, I won. I'm like, yeah, you did. And they just get really upset, and they send more stuff, and I'm just like, can you stop responding and stuff? Because he's like, yeah, I'm ruining you now, and it's just like, no, you're not.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:35.005 --> 1:05:38.819]: 
  That's what you do! And it's just like, what are they gonna do? Like, we... faggot.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:40.169 --> 1:05:42.143]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:37.999 --> 1:06:38.708]: 
  My number is good

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:40.530 --> 1:07:18.229]: 
  That's all I need to say about it, but man what I mean I'm in a mess of a problem I have with mining number nine and this is what I will always have It's like people can say what they want they can say anything But what it comes down to is the game was doomed from the start yeah Because originally red flags were up when people saw the concept art the game here So I see it like shovel night when shovel night was released There was a fucking game with it you saw the game and you were like oh, so this is what I look like even if you have low Hope story you still saw what you were fucking I love shovel night Yeah, ukulele did the same thing you saw gameplay use when they released their Kickstarter they had something to go with it Yeah, yeah that game had nothing but a single concept. It was a single picture and that concept

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:43.180 --> 1:06:45.188]: 
  What a piece of shit.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:07.733 --> 1:07:08.627]: 
  I love shot life by the way.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:17.554 --> 1:07:21.064]: 
  And that concert art was beautiful. It was amazing. And it filled everybody.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:19.107 --> 1:07:57.497]: 
  It was amazing. I had just finished playing fucking Rayman Legends, and I was like, oh my god, this looks just like fucking Rayman. I was like, this is awesome. And I'm like, I don't know if I want to donate it to you yet. I'll just see what happens. The concept art was very missing, but I feel like I can't even be mad. I feel like I just feel pity. I feel pity. I can't be like, and people are angry at this. Yeah, because they put money into it. There's like reasons, but I'm more like, they deserve it in a way because of how they handled everything. They handled everything foolishly. But who is they? Was it the one guy or something? What's it called? Capcom or something? It's like Capcomcept or something. Yeah, it's Comcept.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:26.363 --> 1:07:27.156]: 
  And I'm like, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:28.624 --> 1:07:28.995]: 
  We'll see what happens.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:28.995 --> 1:07:29.924]: 
  by that concept there.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:34.986 --> 1:07:36.707]: 
  I feel pity. I can't be angry.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:37.855 --> 1:07:41.770]: 
  bar and rage to angry at this. Yeah, because they put money into it.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:47.625 --> 1:07:47.710]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:49.178 --> 1:07:51.051]: 
  Would you play the one guy or would you play him?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:54.831 --> 1:07:55.118]: 
  Yep

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:56.704 --> 1:08:01.041]: 
  If they left Capcom and named their company, Capcom. It's like this, like, team that was

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:58.442 --> 1:09:41.987]: 
  Yeah, exactly. It's like this like team that was trying to pander to like the social justice warriors at one point And they completely fucked that up and then they planned ahead of making like an animated series before even- I will blame that guy for naming his company Comcept and trying to literally ripping off Mega Man pretty fucking hard But I feel bad because he must have hired just a bunch of people a bunch of young people like where you probably read out of school or something Well, he foolishly did it because he wanted to like it was like that weird There was like I remember seeing this huge article about it where it comes down to the fact where one of the people who worked on it His wife did like feminist concepts and then she's ended up running the forum fucked everything up Banned a tons of people who aren't praising the game on which causes Oh shit, I hate and then they pitched another Kickstarter, but people already knew about this weird bullshit They were doing so it put everyone in the fence and they pulled that crap where they're like Oh, we're already being backed by a Chinese producer thing And I was like, okay, and then everybody fucking backed out and then they already had that weird stigma with them where people were kind of Confused and like kind of disappointed with everything they've done so far Then they released the game and people are just like this isn't what I wanted This is nothing like I want to only the big problem is they didn't when it when you first start a project like this You need somebody who's a very talented passionate like art director Yes, very talented passionate program that is exactly what they're doing and they they didn't really have either no They just had this guy which again I blame him in a way because he worked for Capcom long enough that he should have understood the situation like he was making this was like This whole thing feels like rookie mistakes left and right He feel I feel like he should have had the experience to avoid some of these pitfalls. Yes, but yeah all the way to the end All the way to the trailer. So it's a little way I almost want to see a documentary on everything that I do want to see a documentary number nine I'd buy it. I would buy that but see Yeah, I mean but but what's this guy's background? He?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:07.656 --> 1:08:10.035]: 
  I animated series before even I will blame that guy

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:36.276 --> 1:08:38.200]: 
  Oh shit, I hate it.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:36.951 --> 1:08:37.508]: 
  K

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:59.225 --> 1:08:59.783]: 
  I want it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:09.942 --> 1:09:12.929]: 
  They didn't really have either. They just had this guy.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:25.332 --> 1:09:29.635]: 
  Yes, but all the way to the end all the way to the trailer

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:35.912 --> 1:09:35.997]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:35.997 --> 1:09:38.849]: 
  see is what we got by that game

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:41.903 --> 1:10:14.067]: 
  He created Mega Man. He invented Mega Man and all it's been Mega Man. He didn't program, or, okay, no, actually, I'm not gonna say anything because I'm on a form. No, he was like in executive. But KG and Afune, he designed Mega Man, designed the character. I think he designed the concept for the game. But one of the famous things since the Kickstarter began was Hideki Kamiya, do you know him? Yeah, yeah, that's who I was about to say. He made a famous tweet where like, when the Kickstarter was getting successful, he made a tweet, like a bombshell tweet where he said, KG and Afune is just a good businessman. I'm nothing like he can't design games. Yeah, it's funny though. That guy's a terrible businessman.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:43.100 --> 1:09:46.459]: 
  He invented man, I don't even think he did that.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:49.817 --> 1:09:49.952]: 
  Thank you very much.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:49.952 --> 1:09:51.505]: 
  because of mother's farm. Placagia?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:53.327 --> 1:09:53.765]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:55.740 --> 1:09:57.225]: 
  But one of the what?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:02.389 --> 1:10:03.959]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. He made a f-

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:11.704 --> 1:11:42.205]: 
  You know what's funny though? That guy's a terrible businessman. He's a terrible businessman! If you're a good businessman, you don't need to use Kickstarter! Their games are like, control amazingly, but all the concepts are half stupid and they don't sell. I don't know, I feel like if I was working at that guy's fucking company, I'd be mad as fuck if I was a programmer or an artist working there. I'm just like, we're pouring so much energy into these games and making them play so well, and it's like the core premise isn't gonna sell copies. I don't want to be too critical, making games is fucking hard. It is fucking hard. We're no different. What's really fucking hard about games, this is what people want to hear about, talking about game stuff. We don't necessarily make a podcast, we just talk about games. It's frustrating because you had a concept and this happens with games. You have a concept and then you just fucking change it. I don't want to change it, get rid of it, fix it all. You add a new mechanic and suddenly your old mechanics don't make any sense and you have to go back through fucking everything and redo it all. Cut things out, add things, it's frustrating. People who make games, they don't know what the final game is gonna be, even remotely. You spend like seven months just redoing stuff you'd already done. People think, oh they had Mighty No. 9 playing on paper and it was good and they just fucked up. Nobody really knows how the games are gonna come out. Nobody knew, they knew they needed to make a successor to Mega Man. Anyone who says that's not true, get your fucking head out of your ass. The guy literally said this is gonna be a successor to Mega Man. He's like, we're gonna take over where Mega Man didn't. And it's like, okay, well, after a minute they added a new mechanic.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:14.894 --> 1:10:17.459]: 
  If you're a good businessman, you don't need to use kicks.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:24.074 --> 1:10:24.495]: 
  sell.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:24.495 --> 1:10:25.035]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:41.168 --> 1:10:44.054]: 
  It is fucking hard. We're not dead.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:49.943 --> 1:10:50.061]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:53.065 --> 1:10:53.453]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:14.564 --> 1:11:16.403]: 
  It's frustrating.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:17.719 --> 1:11:19.019]: 
  It's gonna be even remotely.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:21.938 --> 1:11:23.018]: 
  People think like, oh, they had more.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:27.625 --> 1:11:28.553]: 
  But no, nobody

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:28.165 --> 1:11:28.199]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:40.500 --> 1:11:45.377]: 
  Well, I have to admit they added combos. They added combos on combos.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:44.264 --> 1:11:51.115]: 
  Awesome. So yeah. Lots of slides. They have a, yeah, there's a duck dash, a grind dash, a jump dash.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:48.989 --> 1:11:53.342]: 
  Dash, pop crime, dash, jump dash. Does Mega Man of awesomeness, does that fucking matter?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:52.499 --> 1:12:16.444]: 
  Not awesome on awesome. Not awesome, that's awesome. It came straight from the horse's mouth. It wasn't some fucking ploy where they were trying to fool people. No, they said they were gonna make it. The reason why people fucking backed it was because they were gonna be the successor to Mega Man. They were like, Mega Man sucks. Make it good again. I'm just gonna, I've made this point before on Twitter. Or no, Mega Man doesn't suck. Capcom's done with Mega Man. I've said this a few times and I'm gonna say it again. Fucking Mega Man fans, because these people... Yeah. We were just...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:06.134 --> 1:12:10.302]: 
  I made this one before on Twitter. Capcom's done with Mega Man.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:11.517]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:14.622 --> 1:12:23.937]: 
  Yeah, we want to say my favorite Jeff thing is when you say any time to go these people I'm like

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:16.444 --> 1:12:16.461]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:17.575 --> 1:12:17.862]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:20.376 --> 1:13:24.518]: 
  This is gonna be a great moment right now. And this is what I'm discussing. This is what I don't understand. Yeah, but it's like I can also defend it because everyone like, okay, Sonic fans. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I wanna say that these fucking Mega Man fans, they're always crying, I want another Mega Man game, I want another Mega Man game. There's 80 Mega Man games and they played two of them. There's like years of Mega Man games for you to play. You didn't play any of them, well I want a new one. You know, you asshole. Pick up your fucking Game Boy from 1985 and play all those Mega Man games. And here's the thing, like people like Doc on Sonic is being like the autism train of everything. It's like, yeah, but every fucking person that's played, like Sonic has played all the Sonic games and they're just like, I want a new Sonic game. I bet Mega Man fans really have, or Sonic fans have actually done that, but Mega Man fans haven't. They just don't have a bitch to play. They haven't even fucking touched like X. I've never heard anyone be like, my favorite Mega Man game is X5. I've never heard that. I've never heard a single soul say X5 before. There's over 20 of them that follow that very familiar formula. I hear people being like X1 and X4 are cool games.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:23.937 --> 1:12]: 
  This is what I don't understand.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12 --> 1:12:26.789]: 
  No, he's saying these people.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:30.518 --> 1:12:31.446]: 
  Wait, wait, wait, wait.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:45.891 --> 1:12:45.992]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:45.992 --> 1:12:46.735]: 
  You can play any of them.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:58.902 --> 1:12:59.070]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:08.655 --> 1:13:09.904]: 
  No, god, they're like...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:15.473 --> 1:13:19.287]: 
  I've never heard that. I've never heard a singer's soul say, I've played with 20 of them.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:15.996 --> 1:13:16.502]: 
  I heard that.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:20.164 --> 1:13:20.805]: 
  Very.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:24.467 --> 1:13:31.724]: 
  Yeah, cause there's Mega Man 1 through 10, Mega Man X 1, X 10, I don't know. People like saying like... Mega Man 0 through 6.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:26.965 --> 1:13:30.627]: 
  X10

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:31.690 --> 1:13:40.853]: 
  Yeah, and then there's like the ones where you're like he's like, you know, he's like Batman, EXC or something like that? EXC, Battle Network. Battle Network. Um, Capcom doesn't care about this.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:34.660 --> 1:13:38.895]: 
  Can they have an EXC or something like that? EXC, Battle Network.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:41.781 --> 1:14:09.422]: 
  buying them. Assholes. What are you expecting to do? You're not buying them? Mega Man's been fucking Jump Man for 15 years, go explore that. Fucking Sonic has been, he's turned into a werehog, he's like fucking, he went through time, he had like two versions of him. Are you saying it's a good thing? No, it's bad. Sonic's gotten like butt fucked like 18 times and Mega Man's just been Jump Man for fucking every single game. Jump and shoot man. Yeah. That guy, that guy made Mega Man cross street fighter and it's better than my hand and eye. Oh that game's really cool. The best way to do it is to go to the game.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:50.691 --> 1:13:51.332]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:56.226 --> 1:13:58.133]: 
  Are you saying that's a good thing? No, it's bad!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:03.111 --> 1:14:04.444]: 
 , flicka job in suit man

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:07.988 --> 1:14:17.219]: 
  The best way Mega Man has been treated in the past 10 years is the newest Smash Bros game. When the new Smash Bros came out, people were like, thank you for making a pretty awesome game.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:15.869 --> 1:15:09.008]: 
  That's probably why a lot of them are crying about having a new Mega Man game. That's true. That's actually true. They brought back the Mega Hype. But when I see people reviewing my Nr. 9, they're like, I'm gonna be mean. They'll be like, they're usually like people with like kind of like disabilities of how they can't stare directly at the camera. They're like, this is hard game! Just like Old Mega Man, very hard game! It's good! I especially like the DLC I got and not the original game. Like they're like, I'm so glad I got the DLC and I can't play the original game because the original one sucks, but the DLC is better. It's like, that's not a good sign! That's a good game! Because they're defending the DLC, but they're like, it's hard! I like the DLC! I didn't even spot my truth. Why Nr. 9? That's their fucking seller point. I didn't even fucking show it. I was being mean, but I've been seeing reviews of just people who are just like, they're holding up things and they're just like, I got this game. It's perfect. It's a little hard, but it's perfect. So, the general consensus, big hero 9, 9 out of 9.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:14:21.488 --> 1:14:21.994]: 
  Bye bye.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:48.167 --> 1:14:48.471]: 
  안녕!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:52.504 --> 1:14:54.462]: 
  Bye number nine!

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:03.169 --> 1:15:03.659]: 
 肉

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:04.992 --> 1:15:05.447]: 
  So

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:09.008 --> 1:15:16.399]: 
  And on Irish ghosts go home. Yeah, fuck you. I feel like I've been here. I've been here like therapists for like this. I just like the mega.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:15:15.505 --> 1:16:18.837]: 
  I do like the Mega Man thing though. The Mega Man thing is, it's always something that's always bothered me is everyone like, I mean like, Sonic is gay and everyone calls it autistic. But it's like, the people who play Sonic, they play the same Sonic games, they're just like, I like these games, but everybody has played all the Sonic games. And every time I hear Mega Man, I don't hear anyone say, oh I'm playing Mega Man 4, I'm playing Mega Man 5, 6, fucking 7. It's just a big, it's a big idea in their head that they think they're a Mega Man fan, but they're really not. They play like a few games, they're like, I like a classic. They want a Mega Man game just to be always out there. I can defend some of the best parts about Mega Man is the music. The Mega Man has really good soundtracks. You know the best way to tell them, just be like, hey listen, you think you're a Mega Man fan, name me your favorite 30 robot masters, go. They would name all of them from fucking 2. Maybe like Ice Man, Cutts Man, Guts Man, Fire Man, Grenade Man. They'd name Metal Man and Air Man and then run out. They'd be like, I got Metal Man because he's always everyone's first. Someone's gonna throw out a Bubble Man and possibly a Pharaoh Man, but just because they remember those guys. Pharaoh, you know they're running out of ideas in Pharaoh Man. Yeah. They're my favorite robot man.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:26.811 --> 1:15:27.284]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:28.988 --> 1:15:30.203]: 
  And every time you're making

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:33.375 --> 1:15:34.506]: 
  I'm playing Mega Man 5.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:34.506 --> 1:15:35.046]: 
  Six.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:40.547 --> 1:15:41.509]: 
  I like it.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:43.180 --> 1:15:45.525]: 
  I can defend. They're not gonna play. I can defend.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:55.836 --> 1:15:56.747]: 
  They would name all of them.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:57.844 --> 1:15:58.958]: 
  Maybe like I

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:01.844 --> 1:16:02.873]: 
  Fireman

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:03.615 --> 1:16:04.020]: 
  in the air.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:05.303 --> 1:16:05.826]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:07.412 --> 1:16:08.391]: 
  Someone's gonna throw out

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:10.163 --> 1:16:10.365]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:12.981 --> 1:16:13.403]: 
  Fair enough.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:15.495 --> 1:16:15.715]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:16.508 --> 1:16:27.004]: 
  Yeah. They used to do a fan made robot master per game that did like a Nintendo power be like enter in your own Mega Man. That's where OC started I think actually.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:22.684 --> 1:16:24.507]: 
  Enter in your own megabind.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:24.507 --> 1:16:25.418]: 
  That's where OC's done.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:27.004 --> 1:16:42.445]: 
  They're making anything. They're like, wow, these suck. They just kept making their own. Child man. Everyone loves child man. He's not like these like... Ex-essential man. Kid with a balloon. It's like balloon man. It's like, hey, these are awful. Was there ever a... Mind man? Mind man.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:32.522 --> 1:16:35.813]: 
  He's selling these like child. He's just like a... Ex-essential man.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:38.513 --> 1:16:38.952]: 
  Was there?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:38.952 --> 1:16:39.475]: 
  You remind me.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:42.445 --> 1:16:44.520]: 
  fucking French black and white clown.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:43.289 --> 1:16:49.718]: 
  Black and white clown. Just, is all this attracted to the color blue? Is that a thing? Yeah, because it's something about... It's the saddest color.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:48.216 --> 1:16:48.891]: 
  This is something about...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:50.865 --> 1:16:54.105]: 
  Holy shit. I feel like we're having a revelation here.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:52.941 --> 1:17:07.065]: 
  revelation here like doctors should listen into the saddest color that's what they're trying to do. Everyone makes Mario happy because it's all bright and colorful and Sonic's just blue and angry like Mega Man. Blue and misunderstood and angry and mad.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:57.210 --> 1:16:59.354]: 
  Have a good night again. Keep the color blue, I hope you're having a great night.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:04.146 --> 1:17:08.888]: 
  Blue and misunderstood and angry and that's why people love Godform Goku so much

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:08.888 --> 1:17:17.393]: 
  Sonic has a little red, because he has those little red sneakers. And people are like, oh, there's still some more. Little ray of hope. There's still some more. Maybe it's like Mega Man. I found a fondant in my mom.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:17:12.145 --> 1:17:15.790]: 
  Oh, there's still some more! Little ray of hope. There's still some more! Maybe it's a megaman.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:15.790 --> 1:17:21.696]: 
  I found a fun made my mom. Oh really? Fun made my mom, there you go. That actually looks decent. Yeah. What's the deal with the b-

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:19.536 --> 1:17:25.949]: 
  That actually looks decent. What's the deal with the new Mega Man TV show? How do these designs keep getting worse?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:23.822 --> 1:17:23.957]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:38.436]: 
  With mini Mega Man. Do you know what it is? Do you know what the new concept is? There's like a smaller Mega Man called like mini Mega Man. Inside his head, controlling Mega Man. Okay, that's that's it. That's what's happening in the new one.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:30.404 --> 1:17:30.758]: 
  Just like a

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:38.200 --> 1:17:54.653]: 
  I mean, I don't want to be critical of other artists, but man, these designs are bizarre. Dol is fucking dirt. I mean, I'm sorry, but the new Mega Man design, I remember seeing just comparisons of like what it is. It's not even terrible. It's just, and like, there's no, it's just a soulless design. Just ugly soulless design. He's alright.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:41.929 --> 1:17:42.942]: 
  Bizarre.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:17:42.942 --> 1:17:44.865]: 
  Bull is fucking dirt. I mean, I'm sorry.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:48.814 --> 1:17:49.894]: 
  It's not even terrible.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:54.214 --> 1:17:56.695]: 
  He's alright. He's a nice guy. Mega Man.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:56.661 --> 1:18:41.380]: 
  He deserves more. He deserves better. Leave Mega Man alone! Yeah, leave Mega Man alone. He's even wearing all these corny douchey drawings on the internet of Mega Man patting Mighty Number 9 on the back. But hey, you're doing good. So like, oh, you carry on the flame, so I carry on the torch. You know what? You see Mega Man coming down to the side. You fare whether Mega Man, the newest funny meme, is like people taking those pictures and putting it next to the metascore. You know what? Stop digging up poor Mega Man's corpse from the grave and dingle dangling it around. OK, let the fucking robot man die. Why do they call him Mega Man when he's not even a man? It is shocking when you look at the box art from Japan that even Mega Man 1 and 2, the box art from Japan looked like a perfect cartoon Mega Man. Like, they had the design nailed.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:58.028 --> 1:17:58.214]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:59.074 --> 1:17:59.091]: 
  Thank you for watching.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:00.627 --> 1:18:01.960]: 
  Leave Megaman alone.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:07.309 --> 1:18:09.452]: 
  But hey, you're doing good. So like, you carry on the flame.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:09.452 --> 1:18:13.806]: 
  We're on the torch. You know what?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:18:18.632 --> 1:18:18.700]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:27.981 --> 1:18:28.555]: 
  Okay, let's go.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:18:32.166 --> 1:18:32.554]: 
  Il est chaud.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:33.567 --> 1:18:34.309]: 
  start from Japan.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:40.165 --> 1:18:47.269]: 
  They had the design. Only the American one was like some old rubber mom. They hired the American one. Yeah, they hired Sean. From Sean.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:18:44.164 --> 1:18:51.387]: 
  Yeah They went to they went to like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:47.927 --> 1:18:48.282]: 
  It was

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:49.041 --> 1:18:51.994]: 
  like even our imaginary and like sort of them from bed

 SPEAKER_03 [1:18:51.994 --> 1:19:47.159]: 
  just the worst, they just picked the worst artist. Well you have like a giant blue jumpsuit with like yellow things, they were just like upset and grouching in the morning. And then Megaman and Capcom intentionally made bad Mega Man 9 and 10 posters just to you know that nostalgic feeling of Mega Man 2. It was kind of funny. I think it's funny. Then there was Mega Man, they put fucking retard Mega Man in Street Fighter Cross Tekken. Big fat Mega Man with a handgun. I think fucking Mega Man fans are waiting for Mega Man to put this fucking drunk fat Mega Man with a handgun. It's like come on that's funny. That is funny. They were mad but I was laughing, I'm like good. That's what they fucking deserve. That's what he was. That's Mega Man with a gun. That's what he was. Fucking Mega Man with his big like fucking sweater. He just like, he's like just came out of a bar, he's got a five o'clock shadow and he's got these spandex. Like an American fighter. Does he fight good? He has the same moveset as like Mega Man from the Marvelous Capcom games but he's just a fat maleage guy.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:54.829 --> 1:18:55.859]: 
  it wasn't like a giant

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:59.217 --> 1:19:00.584]: 
  And then make, and then, and then it's...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:11.687 --> 1:19:13.071]: 
  These are the Pac-Man League, man!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:23.264 --> 1:19:24.310]: 
  I'm not gonna take a man with a handgun.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:27.482 --> 1:19:29.069]: 
  laughing I'm like good.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:29.069 --> 1:19:31.043]: 
  They fucking deserve it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:31.043 --> 1:19:31.853]: 
  with a gun.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:31.701 --> 1:19:31.718]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:34.772 --> 1:19:35.819]: 
  It's kinda like a...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:41.354 --> 1:19:42.602]: 
  Erieqdu Why did he do it?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:48.947 --> 1:20:47.504]: 
  He's got like the same kicks and punches, yeah, but he's got a little hang of a little laser gun. He doesn't even have like the mega buster. Yeah, how did that even happen? How is that... I think that... How did they justify that? I think the box art. The thing I read was there, they basically went to the... that Kijii in a... Fune... whatever his name is. And they're like, yeah, we were thinking of having to put Mega Man in this game, and... we don't know which Mega Man, and I think he said, he's like, yeah, why don't you put in like, bad box art Mega Man? And they just did it! So that was the street fighter? So that was the first red flag from Kijii and Yofuni fans? I don't know, yeah, maybe. I mean, I find it hilarious, but... It's funny how Capcom doesn't give a shit about... They don't show like a test focus group, like 18 pictures of Mega Man, they're like, make them pick one, they're just like, fuck it! They just put in the stupidest one and move it, whatever. Alright, I think we were tapped out. I think we've maxed out our non-bullying. We've held back so much. Say... I was just saying... Whoever hates me... Uh... Come at you? No, no, no. Scratch me! Scratch me! You'll probably never hear from me again. You win. Thank you. You think maybe you can share a little tune for us? This is for...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:49.487 --> 1:19:49.740]: 
  same

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:54.027 --> 1:19:54.145]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:58.195 --> 1:19:59.005]: 
  the box art

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:12.977 --> 1:20:14.260]: 
  So that was the first red card.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:15.475 --> 1:20:15.964]: 
  opinion

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:35.489 --> 1:20:36.720]: 
  I love that so much.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:39.302 --> 1:20:42.492]: 
  Come at you. No, no, no. Scratch me! Scratch me!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:42.492 --> 1:20:42.947]: 
  I never hear

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:42.947 --> 1:20:44.027]: 
  I hope we look at a James San Squadte in his jeden burdened

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:47.504 --> 1:21:02.995]: 
  for all the Irish SleepyCats fans. Everybody sing along even though you don't know the words. Just make it up, just make it. We know it. We know it's in our hearts. All right, one, two, three, four. She's a cleaner, father, a toy regatta.
