 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:00.497 --> 0:00:23.110]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense. A world enveloped by a seemingly unending ocean of forests. Buried deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little cabin. And in that cabin...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:24.156 --> 0:00:30.467]: 
  Welcome to Sleepy Kevin podcast aka Sleepy Cast. I am Corey Spaskin. I'm Nile.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:01.770 --> 0:02:28.947]: 
  Let's jump right in. Let's jump right in. Buck naked. Not butt naked, because everyone says butt naked. Is it butt naked? Is it butt naked? It's butt naked. Everyone says butt naked. It's butt naked. But it makes more sense. Have you ever heard it later? No. First of all, it's butt naked. It's not even naked. It's butt naked. When I heard the term butt naked, say it. When I heard the term butt naked, I always thought like a deer. Like I always thought that's what they were referring to. I don't people say in the buck, right? Yeah. What is buck naked? Why do they say buck naked? It's like an opening area where the meadow is and stuff. But butt naked makes sense, logically. Yeah, because you're seeing somebody's butt. Yeah, that's as naked as you can get for the most part. So what is it? But naked? If you're super naked, you're gonna see somebody's butt. It's butt naked. I'm telling you, it's butt naked. I do prefer butt naked. What is, what the fuck is naked? It's a black word. Is it butt naked? It has none to do with black. That's why you say it. Butt naked. Is it book naked? What sounds, what sounds better? There was a girl in my house. She was running around butt naked. There was a girl in my house. She was running around buck naked. What about like naked as fuck? Like she was naked as fuck. Because that's how naked that's distinguished. Like fucking you fuck when you're naked. Dude if you, you started whining when you said that she was naked as fuck. Dude if you said there was a girl running around saying she was naked as fuck, I'd be like, well how naked? But if you were like, like when you're like butt naked, I'd be like, oh my god, really? Tell me more. He was butt naked. Butt naked? Butt naked? Bitch was butt naked. If you said she was naked as fuck you'd be like, you got it dude. I just got it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:42.645 --> 0:06:59.605]: 
  Use the front of your hand. I'm sitting next to you, you bitch slap. Don't use the back of your hand. Use it. What are you fucking angry father? I'm too. Pick your socks up. That's the use of palm in your hand. The back of your hand has knuckles. This is why the back of your hand is slapped is funny. I couldn't slap you. You pervert to me, little bitch.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:48.417 --> 0:06:50.999]: 
  You're like fucking angry saw there

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:51.606 --> 0:06:52.450]: 
  Märоло

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:57.968 --> 0:07:02.372]: 
  You perked a bit, lil' bitch! What? I couldn't slap you. I can't slap Samper.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:01.478 --> 0:09:15.972]: 
  I can't slap stepper. I could, I did want to, I asked me to. Ashley, you didn't even question it, you just did it, Jack. You laid the board, you laid the board. You gave him the acknowledgement, you were like, all right. Oh, Corey, this was a pretty good answer. Oh, wait, yeah, okay, so this is a good one. Joan, John, Joan is, Joan Awesome. Wow, that guy fucking loves himself. What an asshole. He says, what is the most annoying part of anatomy to animate? Corey, you start. Oh, the most annoying part? Of anatomy, like, what's the hardest stuff to draw and to animate? So like, whenever you do it, really, like, how the fuck does this work? That's hard to say because titties are annoying, but they're more satisfying. Titties are manageable. I get the formation of titties and how they sag over the body, but the things I have the most trouble with is like arms, like really muscular arms and how they like bend and stuff. Like when someone does this, the muscles and shit, like there. Is it because you're trying to like make sure the muscle anatomy is accurate? At least accurate enough to get the biceps and triceps and shit, but it's so confusing with like connecting to the fucking elbow. Because not only do you have tons of muscles too, not only do you have muscles, you have tens, you have bones too. Also the pelvis area and stuff is really confusing with how it bends to the penis area. And you, did you have a lot of problems doing that? I did a lot, cause I draw a lot of gay porn. So it's like, it's hard to remember the pelvis region. When you did the Street Fighter music video and you had to draw a bunch of like muscular characters. Sucking each other off, yeah. I had to, I didn't know what to fucking, I was just drawing like, did you see my anatomy? They had like 12 packs and they're fucking connected to their belly button. I saw one friend when they had six fingers on them. You actually said something along the lines of when you started that, you started drawing them in a certain way and the project took so long that by the end of it you were drawing the characters with better anatomy. It's true, that's actually true. This is the same thing with the music video with fucking, if you look at the start all the way to the end, that was me learning from like six months. I learned more about anatomy as I went. I learned more about the muscle structure. So it's over time. So if people need a little. Starbob Street Fighter. I think it's Starbob Street Fighter. I think it's Raiu versus Kandil. Yeah, this should work. It's one of those things where it's really weird how fast I pick up on stuff when I animate and then I almost wanna like ditch everything. Start over. What about you, Nile? Me?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:09.544 --> 0:07:10.439]: 
  Will you kill them?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:38.637 --> 0:07:38.654]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:43.547 --> 0:07:46.045]: 
  I like, I get the formation of today.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:56.001 --> 0:07:56.794]: 
  Which was that song?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:58.161 --> 0:07:58.937]: 
  I'm trying to get out of here.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:05.755 --> 0:08:06.126]: 
  Ja.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:07.847 --> 0:08:09.197]: 
  Not only do you have muscles, you have...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:08.235 --> 0:08:10.547]: 
  If you have muscles, you have tears. You have bones too.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:12.100 --> 0:08:12.302]: 
  very, very important to address. You will hear from everybody. Thanks so much. Thank you so much. Thanks guys. Thanks for coming. Thanks. Thanks, guys. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks for coming. Thanks for coming. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.

  All right.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:34.206 --> 0:08:37.817]: 
  I saw one friend. They were connected to their belly buttons. I saw one friend and they had six fingers on them.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:35.995 --> 0:08:36.501]: 
  I want it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:01.122 --> 0:09:01.341]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:02.438 --> 0:09:04.446]: 
  Starbucks

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:14.200 --> 0:09:20.680]: 
  What about you, Nio? Me? Yeah. Well, first thing about anatomy that I know is literally nothing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:15.972 --> 0:09:16.292]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:21.743 --> 0:09:28.949]: 
  I'm not good, I'm just kinda shit. Oh wait, yeah, why are you here? I'm still learning. I am. Get the fuck outta here, dude. I'm already a beginner. Nah, quit your own shit.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:28.105 --> 0:10:06.006]: 
  Nah, quit your own background. I'm gonna agree with Cory and be a fucking Melvin and say arms. I stole arms. Arms are confusing and also backs. Back muscles confuse the fuck out of me. Yeah. So yeah, arms are the worst. Yeah. Butt and neck it. Let me ask you something. Got it, got it. Alright, Zach, what is the next question and who is it from? Tollorn on Twitter asks, asks, what was the first animation you were proud of making? The first thing you watched and you were like, well, maybe I could do this. Maybe yeah, this, yeah. Alright. I'm not sure it's not amazing, but you know what, I'm happy with it. I'm proud of this. I'm on the fence with that one. I don't think you should ever be proud of your work. That's what I was about to say. That's what I was about to say.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:02.817 --> 0:10:03.357]: 
  That's the

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:04.167 --> 0:10:08.301]: 
  Satisfied is a better point. Not proud, baby. Satisfied is a better one. When you're singing...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:07.710 --> 0:10:40.988]: 
  When you finish something you should be happy with it and you should be thinking about the next thing you're gonna make Yes, you should never sit there and kiss your own ass. What was the first time you thought though like well Satisfied with what I did for once money. I'm an extremely pessimistic person. I look at everything I make as an improvement Yeah, but I make something I'm not satisfied with it I see the flaws because like I told you I fucking improve like drastically each month I work on it because I learned something new and I'm just like that looks like shit I could have done this so much better. I'm satisfied for like technical reasons like I'm glad the audio came together I'm glad flashed in crash 90 million fucking time. Yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:22.780 --> 0:10:23.472]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:23.185 --> 0:10:25.395]: 
  But I don't look at it. Every time you make something, you're better at it. I'm not satisfied with it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:34.272 --> 0:10:34.289]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:40.499 --> 0:10:44.734]: 
  Yeah, actually the cartoon I'm working on right now is the first one that I'm like, oh man. I think I can have it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:43.671 --> 0:12:57.861]: 
  I think I can answer. It is a good situation where you're content with how you're currently in. But for me, it's always a state of improvement. I'm satisfied that it fucking exported. That's not the answer he was looking for. You know what? I was satisfied. It's real life, my friend. I was fucking satisfied after two months of crashing every single day for a solid two months. But Flash was never meant for animation. It was meant for like, you know, interactive design stuff. And we found it easy to make, not easy, but it was kind of like a better PowerPoint. And you could have little characters walking around your website and then people started making all these fucking cartoons. I remember the first time I got Flash. And games, never mind games. First time I got Flash, after like a week of not figuring out what to do, I made my first twin. I did a car across the street and I was like, I freaked out. I was like, holy fuck, I'm an animator. I didn't think that. I quit Flash like three times before I finally went back and I was like, well, I guess I have nothing better to do. And then I went in and actually focused and I was like, oh, now I get it. You know those Flash cartoons? Yeah. I never used Flash. Do you know those Flash cartoons where you clearly tell the person to erase it like a hundred times to make the hands like move out so like the fucking hands are all like breaking off and falling off and shit? Oh, because they kept redrawing it. That was my first like, like Flash. I made a stick man. Oh, you literally like, you drew the first thing, but erased the hand and next thing you drew over it. Yeah, for each frame. I fucking drew like a retarded stick man walking with an axe and killing a blue stick man with blood and shit. And I was like, you know what you don't fucking do? Blam! You know what you used to do? Blam, son! I was, I was, I started doing quote unquote animation when I was 11 or 12 and I actually used to do it paint and movie maker. I used to draw pictures in paint and then put them together and movie maker. I used to make, I used to make like series, a whole series. It'd be 10 episodes, 10 minutes each for episode of these weird stories. Do you know what I used to do in fucking MS Paint? I would take the line tool, expand my size of my canvas, like 25,000 by like 10,000.

Alongside a spider and sat next to a sider and scared the fuck away. That's the fucking nursery song. You just planned it shit. That doesn't make any sense. There was a spider who landed inside her and took a big shit and the guy spat at the sider and said there's a fucking spider on the inside of her. It threw it in the grass because he wants to drink a fucking spider. Wait, the spider landed inside her? And then Goldilocks came in and the three bears said, RUH!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:00.439 --> 0:26:48.499]: 
  I liked all the pop tarts, but the only ones I were able to get were the chocolate brownie ones That you put in the freezer and the cinnamon ones. Well, that's why I'm all this all you had to say. The s'mores ones. You guys were screaming I couldn't say it. The strawberry ones were better though. Step or stop instigating the argument. But they were expensive Anyways. I had to go to Walmart, my mom couldn't because it was expensive. That wasn't instigating the argument See, he's completely reasonable. I know but you were being like I HATE! Oh, you know what? Fuck pop tarts. You know Toast's Trudles? Toast's Trudles are the shit. Fuck pop tarts. Fuck. Woo! Whatever. So it's so weird my favorite song. It has to be anything from Queen is probably I think by Amy and Rhapsody because you just sing that with your friends. But Amy and Rhapsody are the songs where everyone knows the words to. It's literally the song like when you listen to everyone knows the words to be They even sing the high parts low parts they do duets. And everyone knows Amy and Rhapsody.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:05.367 --> 0:26:07.830]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:01.392 --> 0:30:01.499]: 
  Sinking your father's dead. That's a bullshit question though because it's like saying what's your favorite movie? And then you're like a Terminator 2 and then an hour later This is my biggest issue with favorite things and I think like no when you ask somebody you have to say what are some of your favorite Exactly, what are some of your favorite songs? What is some of your favorite movies? It's easy to say what you fucking hate because it's possible to diabolically hate something But to like have a favorite your favorite your taste change constantly I don't think we ever expressed our favorite kind of music on here Would you like to just kind of double do that just a little bit? Oh, well, I guess for me like if I was doing like favorite kind of music I've recently actually gotten into like different stuff. I never used to listen to back then So I've gotten into like like rock just like like rock music like old alternative rock I've been listening to that kind of stuff like what bands like like people a fucking shit Oh, my playlist is destroyed. I listen to finished death metal fucking 90s hip-hop and then it goes back to It really is like I used to have a definitive genre back then I used to only listen to ska punk and reggae But over the years I've grown accustomed to a ton of different music And it's like I don't want to have a few genres. I like and now when people are like, what do you like? It's like well, I was Nostalgia Lee I like ska but I'm getting into like alternative rock and like I know you rag on like sugar rain shit But I would still listen to I like sugar rain. I'll give a shit that song is still catchy I'll stick to it that song play on the radio and leave it all the way every day Wake up with a halo at the end of my four-post bed. I don't know what's this Sugar, it's a course someday Every morning when I wake up there's a halo at the end of my four-post bed or some shit like that Oh, yeah, I play people I try to do it I guess for me I like now I'm Diving I'm like diving into like old 90s music basically, but I'm trying to like I feel like there's a lot of really good British bands I didn't know about like there's a ton of like out there bands like when you listen to American rock What was on the radio you were missing out on this entire expand the horizons Exactly people don't understand how like on point the South Koreans are there Americans wouldn't listen to pop music anymore if they just flipped over to Korean pop music granted You can't understand the lyrics, but maybe that's a good thing. So good. Really. You sing about over here. Anyways now Like any bar later talking valid like yeah, but it's like I don't know the bands cuz all a bunch of Korean symbols But they're great music. I don't think it's like it's like dollar sign Goku's Sign in the back of his shirt and then I'll make my that's my favorite. I'll make my business fast I like I like 80s kind of rock you rock ballads. I fucking love right. Yeah Queen the police Billy Idol It's like snake. Oh, I love white snake white snake Van Halen that kind of thing one of the small thing musicals like South Park Music was a great. What am I just got it to yeah Yeah, it's fucking great very very very appealing. So like it's weird scattered

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:02.944 --> 0:27:05.459]:

  Yeah, with a bunch. Shoot away. Okay, Walter Abajay says, What's the deal with airline peanuts? They don't even have peanuts on airplanes anymore because people are allergic to them. They sell you sandwiches or give you complimentary pretzels. Actually, you dumb fuck! Fuck yeah! You know, when you go to there, you can get like a thing. Like, I always get this like snack box that gives you like a ton of shit for $7. Like cheese and... Just like a ton of shit. They give you like fucking Oreo cookies. Crackers and... And also Jake... Welcome to stand-up comedy 1990! Also Jerry Seinfeld never said that joke. Really? So I don't think he ever said... What's the deal with airline food? You can prove this. What actually happened was he was doing a stand-up routine and some guy with a poppy mic was like, What's the deal with airline peanuts? What's the deal with airline peanuts? And then that got really viral because it was on like a late-night show. You know what the problem with Jerry Seinfeld is? He's not funny! Really David's funny though. Like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:52.917 --> 0:30:55.094]: 
  like cheese and...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:57.557 --> 0:30:59.954]: 
  Crackers and airline peanuts

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:02.991 --> 0:31:03.514]: 
  Also kill

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:05.792 --> 0:31:08.948]: 
  I don't think he ever said what's the deal with it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:20.001 --> 0:31:20.659]: 
  We don't have to promise.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:21.925 --> 0:31:22.634]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:34.952 --> 0:31:40.977]: 
  that he and Larry David worked together. He's got this aura that just rubs me wrong and there's just something about it that I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:36.336 --> 0:31:38.040]: 
  He's got this aura of the different.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:36.437 --> 0:31:37.146]: 
  He's got this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:39.458 --> 0:31:53.515]: 
  Yeah, like he's the kind of guy who go on stage wearing a suit and you just automatically looks like like I was telling Zach the other day that when someone's going on stage like if they wear a suit It's like they're kind of already looking better than you they're already like I'm better than you and I think I think

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:51.557 --> 0:32:11.335]: 
  I think he never makes me feel comfortable. I can never Theory but I've always had this idea that this notion that you have to kind of be at least on party on part Yeah, if not below the exact same theory is like if you're ugly ball the fans of well this guy's below We'll go laugh at him. Well, this that's the very definition of being relatable. That's it. Yeah, yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:55.219 --> 0:31:55.945]:

  Why?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:35.129 --> 0:32:40.275]:

  Can I say that? I'm gonna get crucified for that. I should've known that. Yeah, this is what? No, because I love Roger Rabbit. I just didn't know who was responsible. We could cut it out, man. But anyway, I'm just saying, don't use it like a Bible. Fucking follow your own reasons. That's the thing with books, though. Like, when people finish a book, they always blow completely out of proportion. And they take all the information inside, well above and beyond face values. It's like they just finished some ancient tome. And it could be the most bullshit book. Like, yeah, I read this book on comedy theory and this is the way that I'm gonna live my life now because reading a book is such a task.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:33.092 --> 0:35:35.826]: 
  We could cut it out man, but anyway

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:59.839 --> 0:36:21.861]: 
  Yeah. But uh, Richard Williams in the 70s, he started this movie, I think it was called The Prince and The Thieves and he was literally working on it all by himself for 20- The Teeth and the Cobbler. The Teeth and the Cobbler, you're right, sorry. And he was working on it for 20 years all by himself and then just as he was about to release it, Aladdin came out and it was a similar theme, it blew it out of the water and he released it in the fucking bomb. And um, what you call it? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:06.134 --> 0:36:06.420]: 
  Literally.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:21.237 --> 0:36:58.446]: 
  Yeah, look type in deep in the cobbler look at the type of like backstory or something. Yeah, like it's so sad I'm not saying anything like Richard Williams. He's done great stuff But the thing is people should not take stuff to heart like it's like if something says in in a book if a guy's like listen I'm an animator and I never listen okay, let me put it this way You're not him all of you should have your own choices in life and not fucking all of the rules in the book are objectively true They should make the law objective overarching rules to animation But personal advice like that like you should listen to music or bullshit I mean they're bullshit every human being on the face of the planet lives thinks and works differently exactly

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:26.046 --> 0:36:28.054]: 
  Yeah, like I'm like, it is so sad.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:36.914 --> 0:36:40.019]:

Oh, and you were looking at your dying grandma's pussy and you got caught and liar! You know you were looking at it. I was trying to see if it was there, but anyways, it's like, I had it. Of course there are pussies there. I didn't know if she was wearing underwear. I was like, well, but anyways, so that was the situation where it was like... This is one of the last podcasts if you want that delicious treat. Yeah, let's do episode four if you wanna hear that. But yeah, that was definitely a situation where I couldn't really explain myself and haven't been able to. Whenever I'm in a really uncomfortable situation, I laugh, because that's all I can think about doing. If anybody's ever been in a situation where I'm uncomfortable, I laugh uncontrollably. It's a reaction I have. That's why you're always laughing. Shit! Right now. I can answer this. Do you know when you're in a place, like for instance, you're going into... You want specific examples, not a... Very good. I'll give you a specific example. When I go into Wawa's, there was this one fucking time, it was so bizarre. I went into Wawa's. Normally, I was gonna get a sub sandwich. And this guy, I was sitting there waiting until I get something. And this guy's like, do you like Philly? And I'm like, yeah. Because I was really uncomfortable. When someone fucking puts their hand down, he's like, do you like Philly? When they pop your butt in. Yeah, and then they're like, have you ever had a Philly cheesesteak? And I was like, occasionally, he's like, no, you have not had an official Philly cheesesteak. And then he was going on a tangent about this Philly cheesesteak place. And it made me so uncomfortable because he was like, right down the street, you go in there and a Philly cheesesteak is delicious. I'm telling you, it's the best cheesesteak ever. And then he went outside. What the fuck, did you listen to where it was? Cause I want that. He went outside and he went into a fucking loony van. Like, I swear to fucking God, there was these people that were like skittering into a fucking bus. He was a crazy person who was telling me go because these. Maybe he's a crazy person, but he still knows where the best Philly cheesesteak was is most delicious, melt in your mouth shit you've ever eaten. I don't care. You were talking about a situation that made me uncomfortable and that is a situation. Another situation is when you go in, it's when you go into a fast food place and it's like you want the other person to be miserable when you're ordering something. And then when they're super energetic. You said this before, I don't get this. That makes me, I am kind of when I go out to eat or get something or order something. I don't want people to talk to me. Because I'm fucking socially. Yeah, I want people to be miserable, fucking like just like hate their job, flip a burger at the wall and let it fall. That's what I fucking want. This is where you get bad food from. Yeah, but when I go there, I expect the service. Are you telling me that when you go to McDonald's and the person behind the cashier is happy? You're upset? Happy? Okay, okay, okay. Happy trying to crack jokes, trying to be your bro friend. Boy, let's do a situation. Okay, you're McDonald's. I'm the person behind the cashier just okay so. Okay, so I go to McDonald's. I'm like, okay, how's it going? Welcome to McDonald's. It's not that. It's not that kind of a peppy thing. It's like start cracking jokes. Play along, damn it. Hey, like welcome to McDonald's. You want a hamburger? You look like you're hungry today. Yeah, like that kind of shit makes me uncomfortable. I don't want someone to wait long. Sir, what are you, sir, what? What are you talking about? I want cheeseburger. Okay, call me. You look pretty upset, sir. Turn that front upside down. Ha, ha, ha. Can I have a cheeseburger? Only if you have a sale, say please, ha. Can I please have a cheeseburger? No, thank you. Yes, you did, ha. You fucked that one. Want cheeseburger, please? For this Melvin, this fucking dork. Go, let's go. You fucking idiot. Come right up, right up here. Let me try a coin, let me try a coin. Extra spit. Welcome to Wendy's, how can I help you, sir? Hey, can I get a smoothie? What kind of smoothie would you like, sir? Strawberry.

And then like this she's like, she's like, hold on, hold on, hold on. She was like being really peppy and stuff because she was really excited. Maybe she's in good mood, maybe she's making her day better. The point is we're talking about situations that may be uncomfortable. That is a situation when people try to talk to me and I'm like in my fucking like social cube. I don't want people poking in and touching me. What time, when I went to Otacon, a convention I've been to a long time, when I went there with Chris Oni, who's live here today, and I went there with another guy called Brandon, and we went to a bar next to the convention and this fucking 15 year old man in the Hawaiian T-shirt was wasted off his ass. He was like, hey guys, it was George. Hey guys, how's it going? He sat next to us in the fucking booth and like started touching Brandon's leg and like fill you up his leg and Brandon was like, huh.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:51.636 --> 1:04:52.429]: 
  Maybe she's like...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:30.600 --> 1:06:21.900]: 
  And basically this dude was really weird. What's that one song? It was fucking like, it was some, it was like a Rob Zombie song or something. Yeah, I don't know. It was one of those songs. And he was, Chris started singing along to it. And the guy was like, don't fuck with me. And we were like, what? He was like, don't fuck with me dude. And he got really serious. We got scared. And everybody was really comfortable because he sat in the booth and started talking to us and started ordering shots and stuff. And yeah, we kept joking with him. He got really furious. And we told the bartender, and the bartender fucking grabbed him on his shirt and picked him over the table threw him off the table and threw his ass outside. And he rolled down the hill and tried to crawl up the hill. And the bartender kept pushing him back down the hill. Oh my God. And he tried to crawl back up like four or five times. It was the weirdest fucking thing ever. That's weird. So that was uncomfortable. Yeah. Oh, okay. Amon Riviero says, Zach, your voice is really sexy. Could you please moan?

  You're fucking little... I'm trying to be the voice of reason. Well be the voice of reason, don't be a 12 year old boy. You would love it. Up on stage with the fucking light shining down while you're holding your mic. You're trollin' bro, yeah you're fucking what's-as-they-the-Christmas special, the Peel-A-Ts Christmas special. Guys, you don't always have to gang up on people, you know? Can't have you fucking bag it. Let's- next- Let me fucking tell you something. Let me think. Christmas could have been great. Okay, what is Halloween, alright? It's that one day where you get candy. Stale candy. What's that? No it's not, you're looking at a candy. Hold on! What's that one day? You're at school for the first half of Halloween! Christmas is better, you get longer, you get two weeks off. Can I talk for a second? So it's like President's Day. Oh I fucking love President's Day! Who's the 14th President of the United States? I don't know, I get to fuck a day off! Stamper, can I actually talk with him for real? That's actually a good thing though. You guys love Halloween. You guys- You guys! Let's think about- hold on one more time. Silence! Here's the thing, what is that? Oh it's Halloween? Can I have the day off, boss? No fuck you, it's not a real holiday! I think they're back to that. Christmas is celebrated more, so it wins by default. The end. No, no, wrong. You're wrong. Tell him, you're wrong. How? Would you rather get- You know what, even if I lose this argument, I still fully support Halloween. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Would you rather get a blow job? No! Bro! Would you rather get a blow job? Would you rather get a blow job? No, I'm still- If your girlfriend would guess it's a Halloween character or a Christmas character. Halloween! A hot, a hot elf?

  If you're a girlfriend with guys-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:29:57.443 --> 1:30:01.864]: 
  What if holidays are subjective and some people like the atmosphere of other holidays more than others?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:30:01.493 --> 1:30:51.494]: 
  I'm sorry, but maybe we rather have a lot of atmosphere. Have you forgotten about Hanukkah? I would rather have a present in Kwanzaa. Hey, Blinky, look at me. I'm stuck in Kwanzaa. Those are other holidays that are also celebrate by Christmas. Oh, what's that? More percentages? Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Please, give me more right here.

  Oh, Cory's getting a little bit offended here.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:43:32.252 --> 1:44:19.131]: 
  I'm getting a little bit offended here. Steiner, senior. Hey, magnificent senior. Fucking geriatric fuck. First of all, fuck you. Second of all, have a nice day. Lakado Nihoff says, if you were rich, what would you do? Would you give a fuck about what other people think about what you would do with the money? What's defined rich? Like, you get a million dollars over here on a dot. Exactly, million dollars. After taxes. After taxes. Like, I would go, like, just do what I do now. I just go to a restaurant and be like, I don't think I'd live any differently. Can I have the most expensive liquor and have like, eight of them? Yeah, I would live completely, like, I would live the same way. I wouldn't have to worry about money. Yeah, I'd be like, oh, I'm underage.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:43:56.130 --> 1:43:58.544]: 
  Like, million, million, million, million.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:43:56.502 --> 1:43:57.008]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:44:09.394 --> 1:44:11.132]: 
  I'm not in the same place.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:44:12.972 --> 1:44:13.579]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:44:16.127 --> 1:44:23.350]: 
  I would have to worry about money. Yeah, I'd be like, I'd love to do that. I'd love to like, one day go to the restaurant and just make someone pay and just give them a shit.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:44:20.700 --> 1:44:21.696]: 
  That's it, thanks.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:44:22.827 --> 1:44:33.492]: 
  If I had money to just spend willingly I would do the same thing because I don't really want to go out and do stuff No, call me boring. I mean the only thing would benefit would be well I can see so I could do a little bit more

 SPEAKER_02 [1:44:31.585 --> 1:44:38.453]: 
  I didn't have a bit more equipment for like what I like to do and but I'd live pretty much the same way

 SPEAKER_03 [1:44:38.419 --> 1:44:59.631]: 
  Pretty much everybody I know, like, we live by pretty simple means. Like, we eat when we're hungry, we have to pay our rent. If we need jeans, it's because we need jeans and we have to go out and buy them. I'm gonna tell you something. I had my same pair of shoes to a point where I had a hole that I could stick my entire foot through and there was like, well, I guess I need new shoes now because I just stepped in a puddle of water and it went all the way inside my shoe.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:44:47.363 --> 1:44:47.937]: 
  is that we have to go.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:45:00.458 --> 1:45:38.190]: 
  So I don't give a fuck, like I wear the same clothes I've been wearing for like four years. I don't have, I don't know, like I've never wanted a fucking mansion or a boat or... I'm happy with very simple things. I can't imagine what you do with all that stuff honestly. I would want to be your... If anything, it's more responsibility. Yeah, I feel worried, like having that much money because I feel like I'd fuck up. If I could pay ready to get food whenever I was hungry, I would be fucking kicked here. I think we're all on the same page. Yeah, I seriously balance it in that way. It's like all this extra shit is more responsibility versus like all the other people I know that could probably use a helping hand. Oh yeah, I would also give my fucking parents like half the money I'm like, here you go.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:45:11.697 --> 1:45:11.849]: 
 拜拜

 SPEAKER_01 [1:45:14.397 --> 1:45:15.122]:

  Oh yeah, I was just kidding.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:45:37.971 --> 1:45:45.852]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:45:44.029 --> 1:45:51.083]: 
  I would also like find more projects. I would like give money to animators to help me with stuff.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:59.689]: 
  Wait, wait, just to throw it off a bit. Like, what would you do? Yeah, you do that. What would you do with the money if you had more money? You know, like, what you can't do now? You know, it's like, what? I mean, honestly, like...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:45:59.267 --> 1:47:16.943]: 
  You give this little shit you see all the time like you see a dude make an amazing project and you're like man I wish you would have told me ahead of time because you know I have connections or like I could have gotten you like a you could throw money at people like you know Yeah, that's not me go buy this audio collection here It's great or like you see people that are struggling with that's what I do with broken Cintiq or something It's like like for instance like if there's a band I like and I'm like does anyone know about this band I'd be like I would give them money so they can tell those dude all if I do they're like I would do it all Honestly, too. I wouldn't want to be the fucking dude who's like here I wouldn't you know, I wouldn't be that asshole. Yeah, so if I did give homeless guys money I fucking wear a mask or something like honey. It'd be a superhero. It gives up money I wouldn't I wouldn't I don't know there's something wrong to you know those you know Random acts of kindness do not exist nowadays Yeah, people are only kind if there's a camera in their face and it's camera or plaque or credit or a tweet I really hate your channel Really like if I had money like if someone's just like here's $500,000. I'd be like sweet now I go to out back and get like fucking like like 40 different like expensive $16 drinks and not have to worry about it Yeah, I'd like to think that we have alcohol place in the first day We have enough close enough friends that are always on the ups and downs like a lot of our friends are only really well and Then next year this like yeah, if you find a way to just like help everybody out and you just become this machine like this

 SPEAKER_00 [1:46:12.227 --> 1:46:13.240]:
