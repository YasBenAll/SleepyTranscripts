 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:17.085 --> 0:00:39.951]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense. A world enveloped by a seemingly unending ocean of forests. Very deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little cabin. And in that cabin...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:00:39.698 --> 0:01:20.586]: 
  Welcome to sleepy cast. I'm doing this because Chris had 15 tries and he failed them all so welcome to sleepy cast I'm Jeff now. It's your turn. Hey, welcome to sleepy cast. I'm Chris Welcome to sleepy cast. I'm gory guys. Just say your goddamn name. Let's get into some introductions are on the way man. Let's delve right in. I seriously think it's been like it feels like it's been almost a month since the last time We've actually there was literally no since the last time we've actually done like you me listen fellas There's a hot new topic in town the hottest hottest topic amongst moms in the country the lotto Oh the lottery. Oh, yeah the powerball. Have you played about that today? I played it. I bought a ticket for it. What's the point?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:50.194 --> 0:00:51.139]: 
  I'm Chris.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:55.240 --> 0:00:56.624]: 
  Let's get into some poppies.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:03.576 --> 0:01:04.437]: 
  That's because it was literally

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:04.437 --> 0:01:04.959]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:06.985 --> 0:01:07.491]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:07.491 --> 0:01:08.639]: 
  from the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:14.815 --> 0:01:14.832]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:14.832 --> 0:01:23.826]: 
  Oh, the lottery. Oh yeah, the Powerball. Have you played it? I heard about that today. I played it. I bought a ticket for it. What's the point? Because it's $1.5 billion and my mom asked me to play it. Every time I...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:23.151 --> 0:03:44.361]: 
  Every time I hear like I'm gonna win the lottery, you know what I think? I think there's a less of 1% chance you're gonna win dude way less than I think I think there's a fucking 0.2% chance There's a 1 in like 800 million yeah, but what I was thinking was I was thinking what's more likely to happen than win the lottery I was discussing this election like what's more common it's more likely to get like eaten by a shark walk That's what we said Like we said getting attacked like twice by a shark and sharks don't attack you You know like this thing that sharks are like built up like they're this big scary monster, but they're scared of you You're fucking flailing around the water ain't coming near you listen listen to this I was I played a lot of today because my mom was like So I bought because she lives in Ireland so I bought a ticket put the queue in Wawa to get a lot of ticket was fucking I know the door. I was like a fucking idiot. Why why are these normal people walking in like was the point of the lottery But if you won you'd feel pretty good Any consolation prizes like a hat or something? My dad he was playing the lottery in Ireland like a week ago, and he was one number off But he got instead of getting a hundred and eighty thousand dollars. He got a hundred and eighty Really? Yeah, you know the specific rules of the powerball because there's these no six normal numbers, and then there's the power Yeah, apparently they added a thing where the powerball like they just they made it say they made it one extra number Higher so like just say the cap was like 70 they made it 71 which lowers the odds by like 200,000 Despite doing that one thing I think what I'm at this completely off there, but what's the one way? I've never bought a lot of tickets. I don't know how either, but it's like everyone does it It's just like it just feels like a waste. It's like sticking money into a fucking shredder It's like one guy though. Yeah, but that's like the guy who goes in a casino He's like I have that 1% chance of winning all the money in the scene desert people always play But now it's crossed into normal people land now normal people are playing how much is it? How much does it cost I guess to be the real only I think a dollar or ticket or something? It's a dollar I don't really see a problem with that But if people are like forking over like five bucks, I think there's others people playing way more than that Yeah, usually like our old office was beside a kind of a lotto ticket store But like it was also a convenience store But they were like mad into the lotto and fucking always it would be like crackheads coming in with like cats on them and stuff playing The lotto but wait, this was there 800,000 tickets is that no no, but it's not about the tickets It's about the odds the ticket the amount of tickets doesn't matter

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:30.998 --> 0:01:31.133]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:31.133 --> 0:01:32.297]: 
  I think there's a fucking zero

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:33.377 --> 0:01:34.643]: 
  It's way less than that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:37.107 --> 0:01:38.253]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:40.414 --> 0:01:44.497]: 
  to happen then win the lottery. I was discussing this with Lexi like what's more complicated.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:44.497 --> 0:01:45.156]: 
  It's more like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:46.945 --> 0:01:51.265]: 
  That's what we said. We're more likely to become president.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:00.344 --> 0:02:00.563]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:02.385 --> 0:02:02.959]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:19.530 --> 0:02:21.944]: 
  I want to eat my words. Do you have any consolation for me?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:20.003 --> 0:02:21.960]: 
  I've eaten my words. Do you get any consolation?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:23.817 --> 0:02:24.964]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:24.492 --> 0:02:25.116]: 
  My dad.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:33.385 --> 0:02:33.992]: 
  do world

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:33.503 --> 0:02:34.448]: 
  Really? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:39.713 --> 0:02:40.270]: 
  I heard you had a-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:51.374 --> 0:02:53.449]: 
  I think what I'm at is completely off there, but you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:53.449 --> 0:02:56.250]: 
  What's the one we used to- I've never bought a lot of tickets, I don't know how it works. Me neither!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:01.195 --> 0:03:03.017]: 
  Yeah, but for that one guy though. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:07.489 --> 0:03:07.995]: 
  See you next week.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:13.952 --> 0:03:14.560]: 
  How much is it?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:18.998 --> 0:03:19.268]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:24.010 --> 0:03:25.124]: 
  Oh, there's people playing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:25.714 --> 0:03:26.187]: 
  Yeah, you're right.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:37.409 --> 0:03:37.543]: 
  We

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:40.260 --> 0:03:41.003]: 
  No, no, it's...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:44.024 --> 0:03:45.998]: 
  ahead of the make a profit if there's people going

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:45.002 --> 0:05:29.948]: 
  If there's people going spending all the money they spend on the tickets goes into the pool It's like the system like you know when you go into a casino They know like if they give you winnings once in a while they like it's the best scam ever It's like you're gonna give me three billion dollars and then the prize will be one point What happened though if you were like okay? I'm gonna give you like a billion dollars, but then one person buys it. How does this work exactly? Is this like country? No, we sound like idiot. They're ill informed. I know what I am absolutely I don't know if it's the continental United States or if the other I don't know if Alaska, Hawaii So it's like all of the United States. Yeah You guys know how if somebody wins they have two options They can have it paid out all of it taxes excluded over 20 years or they can take like half immediately I would take half and give it to the most I think most people are impatient most take half I mean like there's probably some crazies out there who are like give me all that money One billion if that if somebody wins one person wins that it's already gonna get cut down to like 900 million after taxes all again, and then if they decide to take that after the cut That's like half that so they might be good on a mere 450 million dollars. Yeah, but the lottery kind of goes against human evolution I think what do you say love because if you got a billion billion dollars, you'd be like billion if you got a billion dollars Whoa It's silly could trillion if you got a billion billion trillion dollars you'd be instantly like I'm bored I'm gonna kill myself. I've got nothing left to do I all I can do is just have people hate me for not getting the money that I have you can be creative We're gonna scam me people are gonna try and be my friend people are gonna be fake with me Nobody's treating me the same anymore because I've got all this money poor notch on his fucking Twitter He's like having a minute break down

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:45.998 --> 0:03:47.078]: 
  spending all of

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:46.724 --> 0:03:47.230]: 
  All the money.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:49.508 --> 0:03:50.082]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:50.082 --> 0:03:50.234]: 
  It's like a

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:55.329 --> 0:03:55.887]: 
  It's the best.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:59.920 --> 0:04:00.595]: 
  What happened though?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:06.417 --> 0:04:11.361]: 
  No, we're we sound like idiots. We're ill informed. But I know what I am absolutely ignorant of.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:15.411 --> 0:04:15.951]: 
  So it's like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:17.065 --> 0:04:18.464]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:30.312 --> 0:04:31.679]:

I would do what the kid in blank check did

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:49.388 --> 0:05:50.940]:

  Where you live in like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:58.558 --> 0:08:49.984]: 
  Good answer. What would you do? I don't know, I'd panic. I'd panic. I would, you know, honestly, it's like, what if I had your mentality, Chris? Like, you're like, what if you win? I go in there and do it and I fucking win? And all these like, wide-eyed people are looking at me and I got the golden ticket. What about when I walk outside and someone fucking jumps? Exactly. You're the target of everybody's fucking mind. Well, I don't think you're gonna walk outside with 1.8 million dollars in your pocket. The nice thing about winning in Pennsylvania, I believe, is you can be anonymous. Some states announce you to like, the wolves who you are. That is fucked up. But Pennsylvania, I believe, lets you keep your name. I would be the most anonymous. An anonymous fellow won the Power Bowl. Yeah, he doesn't fight one like that. You can have a picture and it's just like anonymous. People are just gonna be like, why are you lying to the public? Who won it? I actually, I wouldn't tell anyone, but... He doesn't want to be named. Chris, would you get suspicious if I was suddenly like, I'm buying a Range Rover Ferrari Deluxe today? I would not put it past you because I would suspect that you stole it. What? Why? I'm kidding. You show up in a bright green Range Rover. You're like slapping it. Check this out. I'd be like, why did you do Nile? Why did you do it? You did not... You killed Nile. You did not earn this. I sold my kidneys. Why? Where are the bodies, Nile? You just posted on the nice car, you're like, where are the children's bodies? How would that make me money? Anyway, like, why am I doing selling children's bodies on a nightmare? Just fucking rape us. And you sue. If I won the lottery, do you know what I would do? I would buy each of us a skyscraper and I would invest all the rest of the money into putting four wheels at the bottom of each one and I would make us all drive into each other like big robots. That's brilliant, dude. Make one big building. I'd make like Trump Tower just one inch bigger. I'd have a Jeff Tower, a Chris Tower, a Nile Tower, and a Kori Tower and I'd make us all go into the middle of the desert. Wait, BEEE! We could have a refraining. We could have a little tricycle wheel. We're doing like Judge Jed where we have a block war.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:16.649 --> 0:07:16.767]: 
  I'll see you next time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:18.994 --> 0:07:22.285]: 
  The lot, the nice thing about winning in Pennsylvania, I believe.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:27.195 --> 0:07:28.478]: 
  That is fucked up.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:31.499 --> 0:07:36.848]: 
  An anonymous fellow won the powerball

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:42.147 --> 0:07:44.003]: 
  I actually, I wouldn't tell anyone to be me.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:44.003 --> 0:07:45.066]: 
  I'm frisked, would you get this?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:47.952 --> 0:07:49.302]: 
  I'm sorry Deluxe today.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:54.246 --> 0:07:56.288]: 
  I'm kidding.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:59.579 --> 0:08:03.949]: 
  I feel like why did you do Nile? Why did you do it? You did not...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:03.595 --> 0:08:05.789]: 
  You did not earn this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:08.691 --> 0:08:08.759]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:12.404 --> 0:08:12.893]: 
  왜?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:31.506 --> 0:08:31.945]:

  Okay

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:46.491 --> 0:08:47.622]: 
  We're doing like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:51.908 --> 0:09:20.292]: 
  Oh, it's very- The triangle fucking building war? Like, fucking these things like on like- It'd be like Matt Rushmore talking about building where we have our big stone heads on top. You would tell someone this, they'd be like, hey, you got 3.4 million dollars, what are you gonna spend it on? Buildings of wheels underneath them, and we're gonna fucking derby in the desert. It'd be like, give us back our money! You know what they do? They build them, and they end up being like the thing that moves the shuttle around, and it's just gonna move like half a meter, like an hour.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:01.020 --> 0:09:01.459]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:22.485 --> 0:09:29.927]: 
  No, I would invest more money into putting rockets on the back of the head. Thank you, I was about to say it. And I would invest more money into...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:26.822 --> 0:09:37.943]: 
  Thank you, I was about to say it. And I would invest more money into carving the desert into a big Beyblade tournament thing. Yeah, but what about the fact that we're driving on sand? You fucking idiot, we'd have fucking big-ass wheels.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:32.543 --> 0:09:32.577]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:37.943 --> 0:09:44.929]: 
  It doesn't matter okay, I have spikes in the way that's the only question I had They're terrorists come out with their swords. Yeah, we're over a lot of our tires

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:38.939 --> 0:09:57.687]: 
  I guess I have spikes in the wheel that's the only question I had The terrorists come out with their swords. Yeah, what if they slash our tires? What's they gonna do? We're gonna run up to a 58 million thousand foot tall tire The best part of this conversation is what if somebody was reading a transcript? They would know without the names attached. They would know who is in the podcast

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:45.537 --> 0:09:46.144]: 
  We can run up to it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:46.937 --> 0:09:49.620]: 
  million thousand foot tall tires

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:59.290 --> 0:10:18.342]: 
  You'd buy like just all yeah, Cory, Chris, and Nile. I probably would just for the hell of it. What would you do? I'd buy LEGOs just to spend it all. I think the only thing I ever did in my life that I've done a few times is those scratch cards. Yeah. Because I like the idea of doing scratch cards and winning stuff and then just having a ticket. I always get those and even if I win I just throw them out anyways.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:00.994 --> 0:10:01.315]: 
  ¡Adiós!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:04.487 --> 0:10:04.960]: 
  What would you do?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:06.597 --> 0:10:07.170]: 
  They think the other

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:11.001 --> 0:10:11.625]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:15.237 --> 0:10:15.659]: 
  I always

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:19.455 --> 0:10:25.952]: 
  I'm like $5. I'm like $1. I love the good. My mom sent me like a package for Christmas with an Irish scratch card on it. I want four euros.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:20.957 --> 0:10:22.375]: 
  M Suppose to students I'm такие You're se called me

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:25.952 --> 0:10:28.450]: 
  Girls is the most used. I'd have to spend like 20, 20, 30 seconds.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:27.809 --> 0:11:04.832]: 
  $20 to get it back to Ireland to get my $4 back. Yeah, but it's the thrill. It's the present, mom. It's the thrill of scratching and sniffing. That's what happened. Me and Zach, there was a powerball that was big a few months ago. Me and Zach split it. We bought two tickets and we were going to split. I thought the powerball was like football or something. We're going to split the winnings each. But Zach was in charge of the tickets and we were both talking about it. And then we both lost trust of each other. We were like, no, what? Would you tell me? It's like, yeah, I trust you. It's like, yeah, I trust you too. You guys are untrustworthy pieces of shit. It was just when there was that much money on the run. If I won a $50 million, I'd give it all to charity. Chris, if I won the $1.5, that would be nice.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:31.656 --> 0:10:32.500]: 
  It's real.

It was big for a while in Ireland What's just funny though? Because I got an Uber once and it was this big fat black guy And he was listening to boys on like this obscure. Well, I was obscure in America Irish boy band He's like this fucking bad I gotta fucking movie story to tell I need to tell my Uber story when I was coming back from the airport from Christmas I went to the city and I got picked up by a gentleman who for the first 30 minutes seemed to be like a normal guy He looked like a mix between Adam Hitler and Joseph Fritzl So he's like 65 years old and he's really skinny and small but he's like this old man with a big black mustache But anyway, um halfway during the conversation He's like so, uh, where do you think all the languages came from? I was just like, um, I don't know I guess maybe they all started in one place and got different like as time went on and like spread across the world. He's like No, no, no, I'll tell you what happened and I was like, yeah, and I was like what the fuck?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:04.688 --> 0:12:04.941]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:06.426 --> 0:12:08.924]:

  He's a normal guy.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:03.582 --> 0:13:03.632]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:05.843 --> 0:13:06.332]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:06.940 --> 0:13:10.450]: 
  the fucking and he was like I've ever heard about the Tower of Babel and

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:10.450 --> 0:16:46.720]: 
  I was like, oh no, he started getting really creepy. He was telling me all this shit, like, he told me the Tower of Babel, and then he told me that on Noah's Ark they had dinosaurs too, but they were the only ones that died because their nostrils were too small for air. Makes sense. He was telling, and he was like, I'm studying this. The biggest creature in the world's fucking nostrils were sitting with the sheep and the lions. He was like, and the people killed him because people were afraid of dinosaurs. I wanted to be like, what about lions, dude? Yeah, what about lions, bears, and tigers? Yeah, he was like, he was saying all this, and he told me that I was like lost. And I was just like, what do you mean? He was like, you're lost, you don't believe in Christ. And then he was just like, so what do you do? And I was like, cartoons, and he was like, what are they called? And I was like, Leon Satan. And then he was just like, oh. And then he's just like, I'm gonna look that up. And I was like, you're not gonna like it. What is, what kind of maniac? Like, he's got the answer in his head, and he knows if you don't say the right word, he's gonna get angry at you. He was being stewed, these questions. He was saying really scary shit. Like the one thing he said that made me actually kind of get scared was when he was like, by the end of this trip, you will know the meaning of Christ. And I was just like, what the fuck does that mean? Like, I thought he was gonna like drive me out. Rated him low. I did not even rate him because I was afraid that if I did, he'd know my address and come back and kill me in the name of Christ. I think we talked about this, we talked about this last podcast, like pretty much Ignatium, but I don't want to get too into it. But my mom was like, I learned all about Adam and Eve, and like Paul and stuff and all these guys. You don't even know his arc though. That's always how you catch people in life. I can't even say, I don't even want to say those people. It's what I tell them, but it's like what doesn't make sense, what doesn't add up is everything. Yeah, but what doesn't add up is in like the original, but with Adam and Eve, they laid with the animals like fucking tigers and leopards and they used, they were pets basically. And then when they ate the apple, they started killing each other because they created sin and that created death famine, fucking the seven deadly, whatever. What a nice guy that is. Basically that doesn't make fucking sense in Noah's arc. If Adam and Eve was then and then they made Noah's arc, the animals would have been ripping each other apart. What's what sense does that make? Look, it's obviously just a stupid story that was supposed to teach a moral, but people take it seriously. That's the Bible in general. I don't even know what morals doesn't teach. People are like, oh, the book of morals. What moral is a fucking Noah's arc supposed to teach? You know what, it's always, it's don't judge a book by its cover. Always put two animals on a boat. Duh. Animals are cool. I think the moral is not it. It's something interesting where it's like the idea that what is something that can be used like when people say moral, what's the most common moral you can think of? That kill people. No, don't judge a book by its cover. Do what to others as others would do on to you. I like that one too. And it's like those are the most common morals and it's like there's like three morals where it's like don't do what others see you, don't judge a book by its cover. And rape people. No, that's allowed. That's what they show me. There's another one. See, these are a lot of religious people. They feel they're born without morals. They learn them from the Bible. And really it's a lot of it's just biology. Not killing each other is just make sense. So we reproduce more. I mean it's pretty much wired into our heads to not do things. Yeah, you shouldn't kill people. And the scary thing is these religious people, when they think a non-religious person has no morals, that just tells you they're this empty vessel of nothingness inside. Yeah, that there's some sociopath that thinks, oh, I had to follow this book. They don't have these rules in front of them, they're just because they're killing people. I think some of that might be guilt too where they're like maybe they have done some really fucked up shit in the past. Oh, a lot of them have. And they're super guilty so that they need something to forgive them. That's what the born again, guys. Do you see Steve Harvey's talking about that? There's like a compilation of Steve Harvey and he's like, he's like, you're so stupid. Where would there be more?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:24.439 --> 0:13:24.726]: 
  Just tell it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:25.941 --> 0:13:26.397]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:52.452 --> 0:13:53.245]: 
  I'm not gonna like it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:09.951 --> 0:14:10.997]: 
  And I was just like, what?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:13.630 --> 0:14:15.840]: 
  Like, I thought he was gonna like drive me out.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14 --> 0:14:22.084]:

  I like it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:41.245 --> 0:15:41.937]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:41.937 --> 0:15:42.527]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:02.954 --> 0:17:08.134]: 
  He's like a fucking puppet. I always think you'd have

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:06.497 --> 0:24:01.268]: 
  I always think you'd have the fucking like doctor laugh from Simpson every time I see him Transit camera does a fake laugh every two seconds and on a show family like I was watching him Saturday night live for the first time in like a hundred years and Keenan Thompson played him because he plays every like black girl, but black girl Yeah, but he's like his character in that was so bad. It's like so you didn't even try dude Like when he's like yeah, he's like wow, he's always doing his Bill Cosby impressions. There's other impressions, dude It's not this fucking like, you know turn your fucking mouth to the side and hot clock Like this it's like it's stupid It's like if you've watched him and it's funny because if you've seen all that it's like deja vu I feel like I'm watching all that with fucking Keenan. He's alone Corey. I always thought about like Keenan and Cal You know, it's like two black dudes from Chicago. They don't even swear. They're just like kind of like what have we gone up to now? Yeah, but every time they see Keenan Thompson on fucking Saturday night live It's just like there's this like ominous character that does not fit in the skit lineup He just comes in and he's like he feels washed up Better than Cal did you see that Jimmy Fallon? Not Jimmy Fallon Jimmy Kimmel which one? He did a good burger. Oh, yeah, that was terrible horrible fucking waste of time It was just like when he's a cameo on his own thing I like Jimmy Kimmel, but I hate when he's a cameo on his own fucking skits And he's just kind of smiles at the camera fucking you he's cool Corey. Yes You watched the entire Star Wars double trilogy I did recently I watched Star Wars How much did you not know how much did you know before going into it? Nothing? I know I know Darth Vader was I knew Darth Vader was the bad guy. I knew Luke was the good guy Spoilers. Spoilers. Spoilers. I knew I knew the bad guy the Emperor guy with a cape dies And I knew that he was his father. Okay. That's everything. I know Darth Vader was Luke's father So get confused the Emperor. Let's just run. That's all I knew when I went into Star Wars And then I saw Star Wars and I'm like what's all this other shit that's stupid. Oh That's controversial. No, it's absolutely Absolutely, how did you watch those you watch from like the Phantom Menace onwards or did you watch? I started from the prequels all the way to the end and it's funny too because like I'm gonna break this down exactly How I see it. I'll give you the run-in. I'll give you my analysis on Star Wars from start to finish. I'll be quick I'm not gonna stick long because like first of all I can summon the first two the first one's terrible Everyone knows that's about the man. There was some good stuff in it. I'm not gonna say that but the good stuff out wasn't in it enough There's too much fucking like a council meeting. Yeah, there's too much meetings There's too much like the fucking like the Jedi Academy. You didn't find trade embargoes interesting No, I didn't it's I didn't care man. I taxation of trade room and I thought I Yeah, it's like you're watching Star Wars and you see like, you know Obviously Jar Jar banks is stupid, but his character is pointless and it's like his role in it was completely pointless It's like for the kids but the kids, you know, the kids were laughing. I guess They were laughing. I just want to say that there's a video out there that it states basically that Jar Jar banks is a Sith Lord Yeah, yeah, it's convincing as fuck. It is. Yeah, it's really good I believe it. Which would have been better and I have heard this and I would think it would have been brilliant Yeah, that's what happened. He lost his spine at some point. He just saw the hatred. Everybody was saying Jar Jar was this racist character Yeah He's so funny Oh Mesa Mesa's gotta get to the pop field Poop-a-peepie ha ha I never ever put that together. I can't believe I've never even thought of that Everybody was saying that. Everybody was saying that That's so true. I used to love Jar Jar when I was a really young kid He had those like He was my favorite character when I was really young He fit the role of a slave. He had like those bug eyes and that like snail like texture on his face Well that's a pencil man. What about that? What about the next one? The attack of the cult? The slaves have scale like textures Okay, alright. Here we go. Alright, I'm gonna break it down for you first of all I think attack of the clones is absolutely one of the most insulting fucking movies Because I saw the clone war, the animated clone wars I saw the first half. I saw 45 minutes of nothing but action scenes And like brilliantly crafted fucking like samurai jack style like fighting and it was fucking genius And then it was canon. It was canon. So it's canon So if you haven't seen it, I would recommend it And then you watch the clone wars which is clones of this stupid asshole Which makes no sense. Fucking Jenga Fett And it's worthless idiot kid that you don't care about at all Which I'll get into that in the future about fucking Bubble Fett's an idiot and I'll get into that Alright, okay, so the third movie I like I like the third movie because the third movie to me was kind of like the last piece of the puzzle I got everything. I like fucking open my eyes All these like dumb mouth breathing retards that made one and two I finally got it in three I was like oh thanks for opening the window the light shined in It had its moments. I think I put it in its moments Yeah, I really liked three. There was some stuff I didn't like but overall I liked three I liked three too And then I thought four it was alright but it kind of stretched on a little long It was cheesy and charming but I was just like It was an adventure movie though It was a little boring Don't think of it as a standalone adventure movie It was good but this is gonna sound fucked up But I kind of scaled Star Wars based on if I fall asleep enough in the fucking movie I fell asleep a lot in one and rewatched it I fell asleep a few times in two And for the third one I was awake the whole time I was like I was on the edge of my seat The fourth one I kind of fell asleep a little bit But the fifth one I was on my seat the whole time I love the fifth one The sixth one I think is a piece of shit I think only like the last fight with the emperor was good And I think the Ewok shit is sick Man how many times can a fucking And let me say something because this is something that fucking pisses me off Everyone blows their load over Boba Fett But fucking, Alexi said you're gonna love Boba Fett in six And fucking he gets his ass handed to him By a fucking Brian Han Solo But in a fucking three stooge escape They use a fucking wood to knock his ass into the side of the ship And it falls into the monster's maw And I was like that's fucking Boba Fett That's the cool dude who sits in the background And that's the fucking good guy Everyone likes this retard who can't even fucking He has terrible perception So in my opinion He just looks cool as well Fuck Boba Fett He has a cool design Why is beef with that movie? How many, me and Chris watched the original unedited You know what I think of Boba Fett? All I could think about is fucking the little kid from Shazam I think that's the mother fucking play What are you talking about? You know the little kid The little kid The little kid It's either him from What's the movie with the kid who goes back He's like a fucking baseball player And he goes to the medieval times Oh black, is it? No, oh I remember the damn name The black knight or something Yeah, I didn't know that It's either him or the fucking kid from Shazam With the curly hair That's all I thought when I saw Boba Fett Jr He's like young Anakin But he's like woohoo Yippee No, I fucking, I hated him I hated him in a jingle all the way

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:12.387 --> 0:17:14.732]: 
  He does what I was doing. At least the fucking fake laugh he turns into the camera.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:17.837 --> 0:17:18.224]: 
  Like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:33.936 --> 0:17:36.012]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:53.933 --> 0:17:54.945]:

  Ah Hollywood...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:18.672 --> 0:18:22.604]: 
  Oh, yeah, that was terrible horrible fucking waste of time. It was just like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:39.209 --> 0:18:41.470]: 
  I knew Darth Vader was...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:42.989 --> 0:18:45.132]: 
  I knew Luke was the good guy.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:43.950 --> 0:18:44.507]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:51.122 --> 0:18:51.477]:

  Okay, that's everything

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:00.724 --> 0:19:01.652]: 
  Let's just run through it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:08.369 --> 0:19:11.879]:

  Bye bye.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:30.945 --> 0:21:33.004]: 
  I'll fucking bubble fat some idiots

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:33.004 --> 0:21:33.882]: 
  And I'll get into that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:53.170 --> 0:21:53.929]: 
  Yeah, it's my...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:05.134 --> 0:22:06.282]: 
  It was a little boring.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:17.031 --> 0:22:18.955]: 
  I fell asleep a lot in one.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:38.614 --> 0:22:39.627]: 
  The ending is solid.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:07.369 --> 0:23:08.685]: 
  Full duty sits in the back.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:31.754 --> 0:23:33.475]: 
  You're the little kid!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:42.840 --> 0:23]: 
  I remember the black knight or something

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23 --> 0:23:45.743]: 
  Yeah, that's it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:00.762 --> 0:24:02.449]: 
  This is part racing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:02.247 --> 0:24:08.845]: 
  Yeah, yeah. So his prized role in the first one was terrible. Man, I feel so bad for him. I do too. Like, it's nice.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:02.449 --> 0:24:03.006]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:06.145 --> 0:24:07.309]: 
  Man, I feel so...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:07.917 --> 0:24:19.544]: 
  I do too. Like it's not his fault at all. George Lucas is a fucking idiot. He ruined that kid's life. You know what? Everyone gives the kid shit. George Lucas didn't ruin his life. He did fucking ruin his life. Like he didn't know what was gonna happen. Wait, so there's something...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:11.562 --> 0:24:53.445]: 
  No, I don't see it. He ruined that kid's life. You know what? No, I didn't. Everyone gives the kid shit. No, George Lucas didn't ruin his life. He did fucking ruin his life. He didn't know what was going to happen, right? There's some picture of him recently. He's got like a scruffy beard, and he just looks drunk. And he's like, one of us is like, you know what he did? He fucking like, he threw his mom on the ground and kicked her in the ribs. He looks like a sleepy cat. This is not a joke. He threw his mom on the ground, kicked her in the ribs one day. He's like, you ruined my life. And then he got in her car. He got on a high-speed chase across like three counties. And the speeder bike. Oh, it was real hard. He's letting it get to his head too much. He could walk away and honestly, as fuck, no one would recognize him. What are you talking about? People, of course, are going to recognize him. He's the most fucking hated thing in the world, probably. No? Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:14.447 --> 0:24:15.122]: 
  No!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:23.982 --> 0:24:24.960]: 
  drunk

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:30.141 --> 0:24:31.002]: 
  It's like a sleepy cat.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:31.002 --> 0:24:32.301]: 
  This is not a joke.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:41.262 --> 0:24:47.894]: 
  No, it was real hard. He's letting it get to his head too much. He could walk away and honestly as fuck. No one would recognize him. What are you talking about?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:53.445 --> 0:24:58.947]: 
  Yes, not even Star Wars is the biggest thing ever bigger than Hitler and Bugs Bunny

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:54.998 --> 0:29:14.350]: 
  The biggest thing ever bigger than Hitler and bugs bunny. Well, you seem Justin Bieber. He gets a lot of hate Just vapor his new album is actually pretty dope No, I'm just saying George Lucas. He showed up. I had his thinking cap on he ruined the kids life I did disagree completely. Um, I did the reason why they chose him actually is because Leonardo da Caprio supposed to play Anakin he looks just like a young Leonardo da Caprio, but Leo saw the script and said So Did you like the new one Corey I did but then I liked it and it was like I was talking to Chris about this what I didn't like What was everybody talked about was all these I watched Star Wars? I would every day for like a week I watched Star Wars once a day and then I watched a bunch of Seinfeld, but after that I watched Star Wars and For me I was watching it and then I was just like I get it Okay, you don't need fucking music cues every time you bring up something Star Wars really I'm not I'm not a retard I can understand when I see an object from an old thing I saw what do you think of that? What do you think of like you know the episode one and then all the like the writing comes up at the start? You know with the theme song and it tells you what's happening Do you like that you find that charming or do you find that just pointless and I think it I think it's stupid because I'm dyslexic And I can't read anyways, so when the scrolling text is going out. I'm just like never concentrate on that I always forget what happens and then I'm like what you know Controversial opinion I respect the prequels more than I respect the new movie Because they're so like because at least George looks at trying something different. Yeah, the new one just felt so Calculated. Oh, I thought you meant the like you've respect more than the original. No, I completely agree I just the force awakens felt like a bunch of dudes sat in a room around a table and they were like no They're like and they jot down a bunch of ideas from the original trilogy and this will work This will work and it's just this committee written script. Are you talking about the one? No See I think it felt like a Star Wars movie are you talking about the prequels of the new one felt like a big boring The one that's out for me. I was excited at the edge of my seat for that fucking seat I love that this is what I always saw as and I talked to chat about it You see it is like so Star Wars has a huge shadow They have to fill it has like huge shoes and everything and you see you know like why the fuck did Darth? Vader wear his mask cover up his nose He has had that and he would fucking die if he was exposed to the outside air So he has his fucking breathing apparatus or else he's gonna croak what fuck does Kylo have a mask? You like Kylo? I do but the thing is what's funny is you see Kylo as like that fucking he's just like I love my grandpa But he's a little spoiled shit and it's it's funny Spoilers by the way, I'm sorry, but it's no it is it is It is Because he's Leia's But there's there's something that bothered me about that movie that I oh shit But I thought that I thought was like really really stupid and it pissed me off when they did it Yeah, and I hope I'm not being too loud on the I don't want to scream and like hurt everyone's ears But there's like the part where Faye is sitting in the seat and Kylo's reading her mind or whatever But what pisses me off ray ray yeah, what pisses me off is I like there's no buildup to the discovery of his face He just takes off his fucking this is a spoiler Cory we've established this He takes off his fucking mask and you see this like fucking Napoleon dynamite looking motherfucker and he's like um dark and evil but it's stupid is That part whenever Hans is on the walk thing with it with Kylo and he takes off his mask It would have been brilliant to see Kylo reveal his face to Hans because that would have been like You see it could be interpreted in two ways where it's like He doesn't he doesn't have anything to worry about he's like oh, I don't get I'll take off my mask And you know like it's whatever you want to see his struggle whenever she's like oh, I'm a fucking Jedi too My my feet yeah Destroying stuff my beef with Ray was like fucking how fast she learned how to be a master Jedi It's like yeah, look it took like Luke ages It took fucking he was like in that fucking Yoda forest for years like learn how to do that shit I didn't get in a second. That's another thing. I liked about

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:58.947 --> 0:24:59.959]: 
  You seem just a B-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:04.802 --> 0:25:05.646]: 
  I'm just saying

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:10.607 --> 0:25:10.810]: 
  Thank you very much.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:19.450 --> 0:25:20.850]: 
  Stress there? So we'll get into that coming up. OK, so if you went to the shooter street, did you see our rider moving out— It goes like this, first. Is that it? Yes, so it's a solution. It is, they already driving. Then they'll start going in. And I don't know what time it is, or what radius they will get. So I think this is where a博士 camera's catchment because their equipment might be, it's kind of an orderly thing.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:20.682 --> 0:25:23.449]: 
  So they just got that other one. He's good at picking a script.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:23.449 --> 0:25:23.787]: 
  draw

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:25.474 --> 0:25:25.508]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:48.255 --> 0:25:48.728]: 
  I'm not.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:01.705 --> 0:26:02.717]: 
  Um, I think it-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:08.910 --> 0:26:09.299]: 
  I can never

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:10.142 --> 0:26:12.370]: 
  I always forget what happens and then I'm like what?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:12.488 --> 0:26:14.462]: 
  You know, I'm not gonna read exposition

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:18.597 --> 0:26:18.951]: 
  I love you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:19.997 --> 0:26:21.634]: 
  Because they're so like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:27.642 --> 0:26:27.709]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:30.494 --> 0:26:30.578]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:31.422 --> 0:26:35.202]: 
  No, I completely agree. The Force Awakens felt like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:38.391 --> 0:26:38.948]: 
  And then we're like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:42.559 --> 0:26:42.947]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:46.170 --> 0:26:48.499]: 
  No, the 7th one.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:48.499 --> 0:26:49.495]: 
  Oh, Lord… I would say

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:49.495 --> 0:26:50.001]: 
  See, I think if...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:50.001 --> 0:26:51.537]: 
  I felt like a Star Wars movie.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:51.537 --> 0:26:52.009]: 
  Are you too?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:53.579 --> 0:26:56.852]: 
  I felt like a big boring

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:58.304 --> 0:26:58.793]: 
  I love you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:10.369 --> 0:27:11.027]: 
  That was what he is.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:13.137 --> 0:27:13.980]: 
  exposed the answer

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:19.380 --> 0:27:19.701]: 
  Thank youكل

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:28.493 --> 0:27:28.864]: 
  What are you?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:31.463 --> 0:27:32.172]: 
  What is this?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:33.994 --> 0:27:37.116]: 
  It's not. It is. My fear is not Kylo's grandpa. It is. It is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:39.698 --> 0:27:41.993]: 
  Yeah, layered huts, fuck, to make color.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:39.799 --> 0:27:39.951]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:41.993 --> 0:27:42.449]: 
  I'll be right back.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:47.882 --> 0:27:48.659]: 
  It's like really...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:49.485 --> 0:27:50.363]: 
  But then he pissed me off.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:01.838 --> 0:28:02.445]: 
  All right.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:02.445 --> 0:28:02.918]: 
  We're great.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:12.014 --> 0:28:13.414]: 
  Okay, but he takes the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:32.635 --> 0:28:33.310]: 
  Sad.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:34.694 --> 0:28:37.377]: 
  But they did sort of already blow that.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:36.938 --> 0:28:37.394]: 
  I'm glad.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:40.161 --> 0:28:41.157]: 
  five times

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:44.009 --> 0:28:45.460]: 
  Oh, for God's sake, it's falling down.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:57.070 --> 0:28:58.690]: 
  Yeah, it's like fucking destroying something.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:10.418 --> 0:29:11.498]: 
  I didn't get in a second.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:13.084 --> 0:29:21.522]: 
  Star Wars. Actually, it's gonna explain that in the next movie. Is it though? I don't fucking know. That's the last thing. That's the last thing. Yeah, they should explain it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:16.409 --> 0:30:32.329]: 
  Is it though? I don't fucking know. That's a lesson. That's a lesson to explain in this movie. Yeah, and I should explain that. That's the thing I also liked about Star Wars was, it's gonna sound kind of gay, but it gave me a Dragon Ball vibe, Dragon Ball Z vibe, like the coming of age, like learning how to train to become like super strong. And with each generation they get stronger. It's really weird, but I have kind of like a soft spot for any like, animes or stuff that does that. Cause I've always really loved like, Dragon Ball with like, Master Roshi when Krillin and Gohan are learning how to become fighters and they're like, you know, they're carrying their turtle shells and their milk and they're carrying all this weight to get stronger. And I've always loved like that kind of a training style. Same with like, like the Karate Kid, the Karate Kid. I like the original Karate Kid because of that. And I've always had a, yeah, and this one, it was like a sum up of everything in like two seconds. You're just like, oh. Corey, did you see when you were watching all the original ones? Were you watching the edited versions or the original? Yeah, I was watching the edited ones. Do you remember at the end when, at the end of Return of the Jedi when they're all in the forest and like, it's like doing that kind of nice music? Have you ever seen the original version of that? Oh, the music? Yeah it's like, jungle like, weird, fun. It's like, it's like, you have to see the original. You won't believe it. The music is terrible. No, it's literally like, yum-dum, buh-buh-buh, buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh. I'm not kidding. Yum-dum, yum-dum, so. Yeah, it's fucking garbage. That's one good edit. It's kind of catchy, though. It's really catchy.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:26.162 --> 0:29:26.500]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:30.111 --> 0:29:31.005]: 
  Super strong.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:31.005 --> 0:29:31.360]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:51.053 --> 0:29:53.247]: 
  I don't, same as like the crotty kid.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:56.537 --> 0:29:57.904]: 
  I've always had a- But they burned it. Yeah!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:01.735 --> 0:30:02.005]: 
  just like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:01.853 --> 0:30:02.410]: 
  stay Curry

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:07.236 --> 0:30:07.692]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:08.586 --> 0:30:08.755]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:17.952 --> 0:30:18.306]: 
  It's a little...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:20.483 --> 0:30:21.951]: 
  believe it. The music is coming.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:20.601 --> 0:30:21.006]: 
  Believe it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:21.951 --> 0:30:23.267]: 
  No, it's literally like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:22.997 --> 0:30:23.993]: 
  Like, y'all done.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:23.942 --> 0:30:26.592]: 
  Ba-ba-jap-ba-ba-do

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:26.592 --> 0:30:27.942]: 
  I'm not kidding.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:27.992 --> 0:30:28.397]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:29.612 --> 0:30]: 
  That's one.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:29.663 --> 0:30:36.936]: 
  That's one good edit. It's gotta catch you though. It's really catchy, but it's the worst song ever. It does not suit at all. That's one good edit George Lucas.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:36.936 --> 0:31:49.853]: 
  Another good edit he did was in the Phantom Manus, he changed it from the puppet Yoda to its CGI Yoda, which was way better in the puppet Yoda. This is gonna sound messed up too, but I think Chewbacca's an obnoxious fuck. I hate it here and then. When I was, and when fucking Lexi told me that the little Ewok guys were going to be Wookies, my fucking ears started bleeding thinking about that. She told me that the Wookies were originally gonna be fucking Chewbaccas. And if you've seen it, everybody's seen the fucking Christmas Chewbacca. Wait, Wookie Ewok. Ewok. The original part, originally apparently so it's said that Planet of Ewoks was supposed to be a Planet of Wookie. And the idea of that makes me want to kill myself because the Ewoks alone made me want to carve fucking lines into my leg, but then the idea of fucking listening to Wookie go, I like Chewie. You know what, Chewie is a charming character, he's funny, and it's like whenever you see him like do his stuff, you can kinda, because Han's like, hey, I'm copping attitude with me. He's like, I heard that. It's funny, but it's fucking grating, man. You hear it for like, if you were like me who watched fucking Star Wars every other day, and you're like, oh god, there's this fucking furry asshole coming on to fucking go,

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:40.885 --> 0:30:41.391]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:42.336 --> 0:30:43.315]: 
  Do you want help in the puppies? This is the best.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:54.604 --> 0:30:56.916]: 
  Your ears started bleeding thinking about that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:00.612 --> 0:31:04.510]: 
  And if you've seen it, everybody's seen it. It's the fucking Christmas.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:00.629 --> 0:31]: 
  Et...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:05.320 --> 0:31:05.978]: 
  Wait, what can you do?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:07.345 --> 0:31:08.914]: 
  The original part, original part.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:08.442 --> 0:31:08.492]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:13.909 --> 0:31:14.415]: 
  In the eight

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:27.983 --> 0:31:29.687]: 
  Chewy! Chewy, Chewy, Chewy, Chewy!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:50.950 --> 0:32:15.638]: 
  I was like, every night, I was watching every day. It was like, I won and then won came out three years later. You know, it's fine, but it's like funny because everybody loves to do the Chewbacca thing, but it is the most grating fucking noise after a while. Who wants a sentient grizzly bear as a copilot to rip your arms off? Yeah, it's always like, have you ever seen a 300-pound furball rip someone's arm off? Be careful.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:51.034 --> 0:31:53.211]: 
  I'm watching every day

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:55.287 --> 0:31:55.928]: 
  You know, it's...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:00.889 --> 0:32:02.965]: 
  No, it's after a while.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:02.087 --> 0:32:02.239]: 
  That's a good one.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:16.769 --> 0:32:28.497]: 
  You're wrestling him dude! Did you see that the latest scene where Chewie's sitting next to Han and Han's looking over and he's like pulling open his hair around his penis and he takes his penis out? Oh yeah, it's a little coarse-pain. He's like, Hans! Or Chewbacca!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:23.350 --> 0:32:23.856]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:23.856 --> 0:32:23.940]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:24.767 --> 0:32:24.936]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:29.374 --> 0:32:41.575]: 
  It just came right out of his like fucking Yeah, and he's like And it was the first time she was like Hello Yeah, and then he starts talking and starts going like Yeah I did laugh though, whatever he fucking He was like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:31.332 --> 0:32:32.496]: 
  Yeah, he's like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:32.496 --> 0:32:37.727]: 
  the people admire. He's like, hello. Something is going on.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:42.604 --> 0:33:30.985]: 
  He shot Kylo with a fucking blow-up arrow. There's some really funny parts, like when Kylo Ren starts smashing up the wall and those two stormtroopers turn around and fuck off. My favorite part is when Kylo Ren starts shitting comments. I can honestly say that I am a fan of Star Wars, and I do enjoy the lore. After everything you said, you were fine. Yeah, I was ignorant. I watched it, and I actually really do enjoy Star Wars. Yeah, you were singing its high praises, except for the first three, which were really engaged. Also, we were at errands. We watched the sixth one, the one I don't like. I don't like that one either. You know we're watching the de-edited versions, and the first one coming, I was like, that was a really good movie. Wow. Because I haven't seen them since I was like 16. We were laughing. They're really funny movies too. And then episode five is like, that is a really good movie. And then sixth was just fucking garbage. Or it's six years beginning.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:45.490 --> 0:32:45.507]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:45.507 --> 0:32:46.958]: 
  There's some really funny-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:51.345 --> 0:32:52.695]: 
  Turn around and fuck up.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:54.974 --> 0:32:56.172]: 
  Yeah, I can honestly...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:55.007 --> 0:32:55.497]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:58.703 --> 0:32:59.344]: 
  I would say I love it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:03.495 --> 0:33:04.002]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:07.866 --> 0:33:08.727]: 
  Also, when you-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:11.882 --> 0:33:13.941]: 
  So I don't like that one either.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:20.337 --> 0:33:22.463]: 
  We were laughing, we were laughing, we were really

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:28.538 --> 0:33:35.457]: 
  I like Jabba's Palace. I hate anything in the woods. The Jabba's Old Movie is in the woods.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:28.572 --> 0:33:28.943]: 
  Worry.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:32.925 --> 0:34:34.350]: 
  The Jabba Bits were really good except for the part where Jabba just like reveals from behind a wall you know I'll say one more thing about Star Wars it's funny because my first real experience with actually watching Star Wars was I had a fucking like animated Ewoks adventure thing movie I fucking love because it was a cartoon so the Ewoks talked I guess it was a little charming They were like oh they talked like this so they like had voices yeah Tevo it was great though it was like if the Ewoks talked and stuff and they were like the cartoon I would have loved it That's the Star Wars segment

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:38.325 --> 0:33]: 
  Yeah, how many?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33 --> 0:33:39.659]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:40.409 --> 0:38:37.064]: 
  now let's talk all about every other movie that we've ever seen um okay starting with you guys see the hate point no it's good i liked it the end doesn't remind you of something like jango did you jack up it was 70 millimeters it's a little different i mean it's still if you like jango you'd like this i love jango i've seen like 80 times i like i like ten i was having a discussion with someone i forget who it was but we were talking about how like as far as like western comedies go it seems like some of the worst comedies are from westerns what are you talking about what about a million guys ways the guys in the west it's yeah it's funny in points i think it's at no point i think blazing no i'm talking about the worst films i've ever seen about life i'm talking about like when westerns happen and there's like western comedies they're like usually like pretty i love west not good i mean there's probably some that are good i'm not gonna say like oh there's nothing good from it i can imagine there's a few but from all the ones i've seen like nowadays like when you see like a western and it's a comedy you're always like oh boy that man i don't know dude like after seeing a million ways of dying in the west i'm terrified to watch a comedy of western comedy yeah i don't know any other ones there's a new one that came out that i'm saying that one oh god the netflix one do you feel like they had actual like uh navajo people playing the indians yeah but even then because he was racist what they all left because uh like he there's a like load of racist jokes for them in it so like he had to get like sanded for me when i think of like a western thing i'm always thinking of like a raw like um grindhouse like a raw like grindhouse like just like really intense just like straight up like killing and just brutality because that's what the west is they're just fucking brutal men who come in and kill and like you know leave and that's what i always think of what a western situation would be i think historical records state the west wasn't even it wasn't like a slaughter every town was like a slaughter house wasn't even remotely no no but when you think of it it looks it feels better in that sort of time because you have these like dirty men who ride on fucking like horses all day very much a good westerns i mean unforgiven unforgiving the good the bad the ugly fits full of dollars movies that are sort of a little holly i don't know there's like tombstone and true grits good true i feel ignorant because it's like you know i don't watch you have that i don't watch enough westerns and but i do like westerns i just don't know any and i feel retarded because i you know i watch like bucky larson and nothing good so it's like that's not a movie by the way that's like a direct phrase and again i wouldn't even call the hateful aid really i don't even know if i'd call it a western it's more just the theme this set it's sort of set was kind of set right after the civil war in a way oh really cool the revelant the revelant look the revenant the revenant looked really good to me oh yeah that looked really good yeah i really want to see that too apparently a lot of people got sick from watching them probably because it's like he had like all these chafed lips that were like wow realism made people say yeah it was weird how bizarre new topic you ready yeah okay kori what would you do if you split down the center mitosis and then there was two of you two of me yeah just two i'd be like hey i would does he know neither of you is a clone but there's you cut me off for this yes kori they're both kori's they're both neither is a clone neither is the real one you're both the real one what would you do would you let him hang first i would go into the bathroom and see what my private parts of like then i would go do work and i'd be like you do this and then i'll do this i'll get to tablet setup we could both cut the working process but you like what he does because it seems like yeah i just get worked on faster we like clap hands and watch the same stuff kori then he starts then he starts like wearing like all your clothes starts like using up all your shit by two what it's his too yeah wait wait wait what if he's like the clone in this Arnold Schwarzenegger movie the sixth day we're basically you're the clone and he's the original okay and he you know at first you're getting along then he's like listen you gotta go i don't care what you do just get out of here i'm taking my life back yeah would you kill him no i'd be like because i'd be a coward i'm afraid of blood so he wouldn't be able to hurt me so i could have hurt him it would be a draw immediately you give him a little tug though would you 69 no you give him a little tug guarantee you would 69 yourself maybe probably

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:43.649 --> 0:34:45.117]: 
  Okay, starting with...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:19.607 --> 0:37:20.080]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:29.310 --> 0:37:31.960]: 
  I feel like does he know exactly where?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:34.356 --> 0:37:38.035]: 
  Yes, they're both corries. They're both just their corries.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:46.135 --> 0:37:48.885]: 
  then I would go do work and I'd be like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:53.577 --> 0:37:56.901]: 
  And you like what he does? Because there's these things where you...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:53.948 --> 0:37:53.999]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:00.495 --> 0:38:01.204]: 
  And he stirs it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:05.659 --> 0:38:07.718]: 
  What it is too? Yeah boy, wait, wait, wait, wait, what if he's a

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:21.657 --> 0:38:23.294]: 
  No. I'd be like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:29.301 --> 0:38:33.182]: 
  You give him a little tug though. Would you 69? No, you give him a little tug.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:35.039 --> 0:38:35.444]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:35.444 --> 0:38:36.270]: 
  I can't even...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:38.144 --> 0:39:40.429]: 
  There a problem with that? Would you ask him to shave his ass first? I don't know if these are like the important questions that I would be asking him. First of all, I'd be like, I'd be like, how did this happen? You're me! I'd be like, you're me from the future! No, let's have sex! You're both you from now. I'd be like, this is like Twisted Sisters is crazy! This is crazy! This is like 17-inch. Freaky Friday. Freaky Friday! With onesie low hands! Just like that. No, it's not! What if it's like this? What if it's like Chris? Let's say you do the multiplicity. You can make a clone of yourself. You can make as many clones as you want. And you all get along perfectly. But every time you make a clone, the next clone is about 25% stupid in the previous one. That's what would happen! The first clone would be a fucking re-turn! How many clones could you have before you'd be like, all right, that would have been enough. I can't stand. Okay, let me think. So, like a multiplicity, like the fourth Michael Keaton clone, he was putting pizza slices in his wallet. Oh. He's like, pizza, but love pizza.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:42.413 --> 0:38:42.936]: 
  I don't know.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:42.936 --> 0:38:43.847]: 
  I don't know if these are like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:46.480 --> 0:38:48.218]: 
  First of all, I really had a feeling.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:58.343 --> 0:38:58.950]: 
  This is like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:00.014 --> 0:39:00.992]: 
  17 again.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:00.992 --> 0:39:03.996]: 
  Freaky Friday Freaky Friday

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:03.996 --> 0:39:06.831]: 
  It's just like that. No, it's not. What if it's like this?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:08.164 --> 0:39:08.451]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:08.502 --> 0:39:08.856]: 
  Let's see you next time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:10.105 --> 0:39:11.016]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:22.491 --> 0:39:25.326]: 
  What happened? I would have the first clone would be a fucking return.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:30.524 --> 0:39:31.047]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:31.941 --> 0:39:32.430]: 
  So.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:40.429 --> 0:39:42.167]: 
  That's what it is while it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:41.999 --> 0:40:36.387]: 
  So by four they're like, they're like really bad. It's not this funny. I want to see it now. He's licking pizza slices and he's like, I love pizza. He puts it in his fucking wallet. It's something cardy. I would just keep doing it and laughing. I just keep making them stupid. They would come out spitting bubbles and I'd be like, I'll always come to their same though. It'd be weird. I'll just be like, hey. I would light them up and you'd start seeing them running back. Would you be really mad if your fourth clone was smarter than you? I would kill him. Just go backwards because he's just getting in the way. No, you'd get all confused. The second one I cloned is just like, he's just a vegetable who can't talk. Then the third one is just really smart and suave and his hair is backing everything. Then the fourth one is just like a pile of mush on the ground. I'm just like, mine's fucking unfair and Chris is completely working properly. Chris, what would you do if you were to get into a fight?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:02.417 --> 0:40:02.890]: 
  Sorry

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:02.890 --> 0:40:04.442]: 
  You have like clothes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:04.442 --> 0:40:04.459]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:35.594 --> 0:40:38.209]: 
  What would you do if you had an evil genius clone?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:37.585 --> 0:40:40.470]: 
  Cory hit play, so that's gonna be like Chris's clone.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:42.900 --> 0:40:44.487]: 
  Ah avec pita.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:47.119 --> 0:42:15.291]: 
  I've seen this movie. I haven't seen this movie. I haven't heard of it. I fucking- I love this movie. Is it- I didn't remember- Michael Keaton, though. I didn't remember what it was called. Oh my god. Hahaha. You're stupid. This movie was brilliant. You're stupid. I remember seeing it. But brilliant. I don't know if I saw it on the- this is gonna sound weird, but I don't remember if I saw it on something like fucking- like HBO. I think I saw it on HBO, and I- I loved it, and I recorded it on the VCR, and I put it on an old, like, Christian movie thing. It's a funny premise to just keep- That is- that is good. Getting stupider over there, we got one. Why would he keep doing it, though? Because he was trying to make his life easier. At first, like, his wife's, like, clean the house, and he's like, I don't feel like it. So he makes a- I don't know, if he makes a clone. Yeah, yeah, just sets up kinda- Everything's cool, but then- then he has this dude licking pizza slices, and he's like, this is gonna do far. That's horrible, because then you have to kill it. Yeah, well, you could- it would be easy. You could take the food out of his hand and throw it off a cliff, and he'd run after it, because he has no perception. You gotta think of it logically, though, right? So, Seder's two of you, right? You're like, oh, you can do half my work, and I'll play video games. I know you. You will get bored. You'll be like, I wanna work, and then he'll be on your synth, and you'll be like, get off! And then you'll both be scuffling, and then you'll both- I'd push him off, and you'll get- You'll have to get rid of him, but he's thinking everything you're thinking at the same time. No, they'll be like, Cory's working in Burger King, they'll be Cory sweeping the floor outside to be Cory. I wouldn't be working in Burger King. They'll just be Cory's everywhere. All the Cory's would be fighting over the synth, he'd- Yeah, they would all be- Everybody would be fighting over the synth, he'd- Cory's fighting- Cory Forteity Bag, it's my turn! I've been waiting!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:59.252 --> 0:41:02.442]: 
  It's brilliant. It is stupid. I remember seeing it. It's stupid, but brilliant.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:01.935 --> 0:41:02.459]: 
  Good brilliant.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:14.659 --> 0:41:19.215]: 
  I used to watch it. You just keep getting stupid or whatever. That's illegal. Why would you keep doing it though?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:21.561 --> 0:41:21.932]:

So, clone one is the original, the harbor of all the personalities. Then clone two would be- How do I get servers? Clone two would be my like emo side. Clone three would be my like narcoleptic tired side. Clone four would be my drunk side. Clone five would be my like sexual perverted side. I'd probably be two. Oh god, that wouldn't be cool. Clone five, six would be- Cool side. Like clones. With the sunglasses. Jeff 35 would finally be the nice one. Yeah, Jeff, you come out. That's hard to go over. You'd have Jeff- You'd have Jeff like 16 come out and he's like completely like ripped and walks out. And he's just like- He's like super nice. He's just- he's always funny. Nobody else is like, alright, just kill Jeff 133 now. Nah, what would your clones do? I mean, all our clones are being productive at work. I don't know, I feel like I'm pretty transparent. All your clones walk around breaking people's shit and pouring gravy on their chairs. Yeah, they're all the same. You'll have clone Nile 314. Nile 314 is the same.

I always do wonder, if you went into the future, would you look really deformed to everybody else? Yeah, probably. Because everyone else is wearing their onesies with fucking circles around your head and you're the fan. And a fucking hoodie. I'm not talking about that. There was some size magazine where they actually tried figuring out what humans would look like if thousands did.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:36.998 --> 0:54:37.707]:

  They'll all be beautiful, right?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:56.505 --> 0:56:54.951]: 
  I think yeah one of the one of the things is like yeah We'd all sort of breed together into this light brown race, but we don't have bigger eyes too Because they think that DNA profiling would become a thing where like you're able to choose what your what traits your child will have You'd be like I want a blonde-haired blue-eyed child with big eyes and huge tits. Jeff What would you do if you went to the future? I want my little boy to have huge tits. You were in the same situation You would just drop to the time period where you're set up exactly like you are now I'd go to the internet whatever that is and watch die hard And I'd play Street Fighter 8 9 10 11 12 You gotta catch up Coming out with like contact lens instead of Google Glass is contact lenses. That's cool. That's smarter. That's scary You'll be in a bathroom. So we stick their head up over the toilet stall look at you with their landscape record And you'd be like I feel like I don't think that's like there'll be cameras in that at some point Literally just do you wear contacts? No, I wear contacts. You do. Yes. Are you wearing them right now? Yeah, do you think you would heard if there were cybernetic technology? I'm just saying they're so thin and flimsy and the fact that you can't focus on an image on a fucking contact lens Really? No, but they have their own thinger in front of your eye like this. Can you focus? I bought an eye patch like what we could go I'm still waiting for you Cuz Chris doesn't like recalibrate his eyes not to be lazy my eye like goes out of sync So it'll start like facing south matter. I'll be facing north. That's weird Not like it's not that bad But if I wear an eye patch on my good eye for a bit then it gets back to normal Why does that happen? I don't know cuz I got a retardation in my brain my brain now work probably my brain broken My eyeball not connect brain no more. It is now time for the patreon Q&A boot do

  That's smarter. That's scary because you'll be in a

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:51.096 --> 0:55:51.754]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:57.880 --> 0:56:01.964]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:54.951 --> 0:56:57.398]: 
  Who asks what?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:57.263 --> 0:57:01.819]: 
  Okay, our first question comes from Aaron Dennis-Jan. He says...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:01.785 --> 0:57:11.995]: 
  You answered my question last time, which was awesome. So if you wanted to answer it here, that would be fine. What the fucking question? Is there any hope left for cooking with Samper?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:12.062 --> 0:57:36.818]: 
  Oh, he's not here, so I don't- We actually cannot answer for him. Mick or Samper, I'm here, so we can answer. You and him selling a frail blood. I think he'll do something. Mick and Samper are a force. Samper and Mick cook things all the time. Yeah, they're together. They'll do their own things. They'll probably do it, but not for Sleepy Cabin. And maybe if it's not a cooking show, they'll do something. You'll just get a skate on Samper's channel one day, just look out for that. Okay, our next question comes from Hosea H. Zarret. Okay, he says- Someone else needs a reason to answer.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:17.040 --> 0:57:17.074]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:18.087 --> 0:57:21.462]:

  Yeah, there's your

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:23.689 --> 0:57:27.419]: 
  They'll probably do it but not for sleepy cabin.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:28.785 --> 0:57:29.241]: 
  You'll just...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:31.435 --> 0:57:31.941]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:31.941 --> 0:57:32.194]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:36.801 --> 0:57:41.880]: 
  What do you think of reaction channels reacting to YouTube cartoons? Reaction channels and channels.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:40.581 --> 0:59:52.679]: 
  Reaction channels in general if they're done, right? They can be okay like if you add your own Original content to them and make them entertaining for your audience Reaction videos well we all have different opinions if we're talking about the reaction videos this is on the reaction But I know this is on the separate on reactor video. There's a non reaction people They should be extra killed then there's the people are the fake reaction video people who watch something And then they're like oh I have to do a reaction video and then they they do this poorly acted version of them reacting for the first time And then there's a small 5% that just use it as a caption to get people to watch their video and talk about nothing related to it Bobby clan member Bobby Bobby Oh, I thought that was actually what do you know Jan is not their names. It's the month Jan is the month Bobby Jenny Bobby K Bobby Bobby Kosek what are your thoughts on the old adulter them show 12 ounce mouse horrible Yeah, people people defend it and you know it's understandably fine go ahead and defend it people like oh if you like this animation styles of What's that one show with the shake?

I did it. And then, oh, here's the thing. I did that for them to promote one of their horrible, shitty, horrendous online videos called Appartment Red. And it was the worst shit I've ever seen in my life. Keep in mind, like Chris only started getting kind of like, this was Chris's first like, kind of mainstream thing. I'm just not, I'm bringing this up because I did the two videos for them. And then they were like... It was on their channel, Appartment Red. It might not even be there anymore. But they were like, so Chris, we want you to do more videos for us. I was like, I'm starting, my YouTube's starting to take off and you're not paying me very well. And it's not really worth it. So I'm just gonna stick... I didn't say that like harshly, but I was very polite. I was like, I don't think this is like worth it anymore. I'm sorry. It was really nice working with you and stuff.

Yeah, we're like sitting in a campfire talking about their zombie things I had to do that from a shinaman. I didn't even know how to animate. I was like Chris. Look I animated this bullshit And she's like what? But it was it was horrible the script was so bad. Do you remember? It was just it was terrible for me it was probably Fixing perfect. I would say sanity was so funny though I would say thank you But I would say sanity what used to be it until I worked on fixing perfect and then I realized that like you know Maybe it's not the best idea to work with flaky people Because I experienced everything that nobody wants to experience. I Know I shouldn't talk about it. No, it doesn't matter I experienced like incompetent like people to work with I Experienced like I'm basically one of the worst people to work with it was literally like being somebody who had to run something And everyone just flaked out on you and you're just like director.

Wait, there was a few there was one or two There was a watch. When my team when the show I worked on was coming on the air. There was what was the one with like little George Bush or whatever What was that called? Little Bush? Little Bush or something? Yeah, it was on Comedy Central Yeah, little Bush. But then there was another one. Shorties watch Shorties. Is it the one where there's just nothing but Dane Cook? I gotta look this up real fast.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:55.718 --> 1:06:55.887]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:01.219 --> 1:07:01.658]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:03.261 --> 1:07:04.729]: 
  Is that Petry? You guys are Petry.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:10.551 --> 1:07:12.863]: 
  Problem solvers. Problem solvers.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:14.652 --> 1:07:15.293]: 
  There's two.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:17.487 --> 1:07:21.469]: 
  It was a clutch. When the show I worked on was coming on the air, there was...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:28.337 --> 1:07:30.362]: 
  But then there was another one.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:31.830 --> 1:07:40.487]: 
  My one is a Dean Cook. I gotta look this up real fast. Why don't you do that? My one was forget about it. It's about an Italian mob who moves to Canada. A mafioso like it. That was terrible.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:39.492 --> 1:07:52.131]: 
  That was terrible. It was just awful. It was just kind of full of like a towning cliché joke. Those are like Hulu originals though. There was that one about that mom who's like a model who doesn't like her kids. Yeah, yeah, that one sucks too. The awesome one sucks.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:43.305 --> 1:07:43.947]: 
  Those are like...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:43.947 --> 1:07:45.921]: 
  Hulu Originals though.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:48.705 --> 1:07:54.359]: 
  Yeah, yeah, that one's fucking sucks dude. Yeah, but forget about it. The awesome one sucks. And then Lee's a league of its own. The awesome one sucks.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:53.819 --> 1:10:18.640]: 
  The awesomeos, they fucking sucked too. Oh, the awesomes? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't even understand what was going on there. It's just garbage, man. Hulu has terrible cartoon fucking programs, but good other stuff. Have you seen the new Seth MacFarlane cartoon? What is it called? Bordechon? Yeah, Bordechon. I think there's probably a question there about that. I bet everybody wants to know we fucking think another boy town is fucking here. You know, this is what I think. Like, power to the fucking animators who had to work through that tripe garbage. But what it really comes down to is they had all these animated cartoons prepared ahead of time. They're gonna fucking release it because they invested money into it. It's terrible, but they're gonna release it and that's it. I don't see this thing making another season. I expect it to bomb after the first season. The only reason why I'm saying I want to give it a chance is because I saw the trailer for Ethis for Family Look Garbage. Watch the show. Pretty good. Here's the bizarre show. The characters are ugly. The writing's bad. You found it? Yeah, sorry. All right, when I was from the show, I worked on Came Out in the Air in like 2003 or 2004, something like that. It was called VH1 Illustrated. This show came out on Comedy Central at the exact same time. It was called Kidna-Torious. Have you heard about this? No, no. Actually, I recognize the name. Have you heard of it? You know a man by the name of Robert Evans. No. Nobody does. This man, he's a Hollywood producer. His name is Robert Evans. He produced a bunch of movies in Hollywood in like this fucking 70s. When the show was being produced, he's like 85, he's literally 85 years old now. When the show was being produced, he was like 75 years old. This is how he's drawn in the show. I don't know if you guys can see it. He looks like the coolest dude in the fucking hood. I don't even understand how the show came to be. Like this guy, which is not known for like being a real personality anywhere, he went to Comedy Central and I don't know if he went to Comedy Central. He's like, I am going to pay you an inordinate amount of money. I don't care how much it costs. I want an animated show about me. I swear this is what happened. Why is his name Kidna-Torious? I don't know. Kidna-Torious starring Robert Evans. Ask Kidna-Torious. I went to New York City, break before our show aired and there was billboards for the show everywhere. Really? Everybody's like, who the fuck is Robert Evans? Kidna-Torious starring Robert Evans. What's its rating on IMBD? Oh, I don't know. Probably 2.5 or something. So next question is, Corey asks, what are each of your ultimate goals pertaining to your careers and legacies? For me, I just want to make something I'm proud of. I haven't even come close to anything like that. That's a nice question.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:55.472 --> 1:07:56.249]: 
  For the awesomes.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:01.463 --> 1:08:02.644]: 
  But other good other stuff

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:02.644 --> 1:08:03.201]: 
  Have you seen this?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:06.019 --> 1:08:06.914]: 
  Yeah, efficiency

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:11.993 --> 1:08:13.005]: 
  Nah it was just fuckin'уска

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:24.091 --> 1:08:24.935]: 
  Eins beigehenах

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:32.834 --> 1:08:33.880]: 
  The only reason why I'm-

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:38.435 --> 1:08:39.667]: 
  Here's those bizarre shells.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:40.950 --> 1:08:42.098]: 
  He's bad.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:54.872 --> 1:08:57.117]: 
  No. Actually, I recognize the name.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:55.850 --> 1:08:56.492]: 
  Actually, I reckon it's...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:21.687 --> 1:09:25.450]: 
  The slob dapper motherfucker.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:50.340 --> 1:09:51.674]: 
  Ask feather dealer.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:06.507 --> 1:10:06.962]: 
  알아요.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:18.049 --> 1:10:25.947]: 
  That's a nice question. That's what I want to do is I want to make something I'm proud of that I can look back at. Who's on the phone now, Jeff? I have good ideas, I think.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:19.568]: 
  question.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:19.568 --> 1:10:20.057]: 
  I'm gonna do it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:22.268 --> 1:10:22.470]: 
  call.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:22.470 --> 1:11:24.908]: 
  Who's on the phone now, Jeff? I have good ideas, I think. Shut up. That noise that the iPad makes, I love that noise when he closes. It's just so satisfying. It's like this audible fucking thing. That was a very realistic reverb you just did. I know, I thought it was just me. But um... Why did you do that? That was really good. It sounded like a Metal Gear solid reverb. Yeah, you know when you click circle when you get on the new mouse. Anyways, close the question again. Now what are each of your ultimate goals, pertaining to your career's legacies? I said, um, I haven't made mine yet. I just want to make something I'm proud of. I haven't done anything. I want to get to the point where I'm storyboarding and everyone else is animating and I don't have to worry about money. I want to build a clone army. Like in Star Wars. I guess mine would be like... Jeff, the clone boy. I want to make, finish this game with Jeff and hope it does good. This is like ultimate. Like, what do you want to do? That! When you're like 90 and you like... I want to be known for a game that I legitimately like. Oh cool, that's awesome. I'm gonna hire Chris to be me. Whoa, talk like me again, Chris. Hey Chris, since it's an open spot, can I be you? Okay, I'm Jeff and you're me. Hey, Chris.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:25.947 --> 1:10:26.740]: 
  Shut up.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:29.372 --> 1:10:29.828]: 
 .�

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:33.017 --> 1:10:34.266]: 
  That was a very realistic

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:35.430 --> 1:10:39.936]: 
  I thought I was gonna lose me. But um... Why did you do that? That was really good.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:39.936 --> 1:10:40.628]: 
  Good.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:42.164 --> 1:10:42.720]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:45.117 --> 1:10:46.990]: 
  Anyways, what was the question again?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:54.651 --> 1:10:55.292]: 
  I want to get

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:01.958 --> 1:11:02.447]: 
  It is my...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:04.624 --> 1:11:05.924]: 
  Jeff, the cold war.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:08.185 --> 1:11:10.362]: 
  This is like ultimate like this is what you want to bet

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:11.594 --> 1:11:13.247]: 
  I want to be known for a game that I literally...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:16.994 --> 1:11:17.382]: 
  Whoa.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:19.710 --> 1:11:21.702]: 
  Hey Chris, since it's an open spot, can I be you?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:24.469 --> 1:11:26.444]: 
  Hey, what a fuck?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:26.444 --> 1:11:27.473]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:27.507 --> 1:11:37.581]: 
  Let's do it! You're very hot. I don't know about this. Wow. I'm really gay. Fuck me. Oh man, I'm wearing these skin tight up woman yoga pants. You don't have an aside real fast.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:31.219 --> 1:11:31.675]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:35.387 --> 1:12:28.898]: 
  Hey, you don't have an aside real fast from the questions. What? I got this thing on the subreddit. This kid sent me a bunch of questions. Oh, I saw that. I saw your amazing Jeff Kats. I tried answering them. But apparently this kid was what? Where did you do that at? Just in my room. There was a kid who was overly concerned with, I don't know. This is a really thing, but he's overly concerned with masculinity. He wants to be more masculine. What do you think about that, Chris? What is masculine? What is masculine? I'm assuming I assume. Wait, I need you to explain this better. So he's concerned with needing to be more masculine? Yeah. Why? Yeah, why? It's be yourself, dude. I don't know. Somebody else chimed in and like, listen. Oh, I read a bunch of books on it, too. This would help. What? I don't really want something. I think the definition of the thing about it is being more confident and outgoing. It's like reading books on how to be funny. It just doesn't work that way. What you got to do is you got to read books.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:42.205 --> 1:11:45.495]: 
  Oh I saw that and I saw your amazing Jeff cat.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:47.537 --> 1:11:51.621]: 
  This kid was what? Where did you do that at? I just in my room. There's a kid.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:00.497 --> 1:12:02.877]: 
  What is masculine? Well, what is masculine?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:03.990 --> 1:12:04.058]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:04.058 --> 1:12:06.134]: 
  Chop down trees with an axe. Wait, I need

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:10.994 --> 1:12:13.457]: 
  Why? Yeah, why? Spear's up, dude. Fuck.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:18.840 --> 1:12:19.279]: 
  I think

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:19.279 --> 1:12:19.937]: 
  I think I

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:23.312 --> 1:12:23.886]: 
  That's tough.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:26.890 --> 1:12:36.002]: 
  Yeah, what you gotta do is you gotta really really like yourself learn to like yourself and then whenever you do is you go out Maybe you're just not a man. How do you be a man?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:33.015 --> 1:12:40.086]: 
  Maybe you're just not a man, huh? How do you be a man? I don't really, like, I just seriously... I'm not masculine at all. You wouldn't call me a man.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:38.179 --> 1:12:54.953]: 
  I'm not masculine at all. You wouldn't call me manly, I just... I don't like fighting, I don't like... Being masculine is not something that I think about all the time. Yeah, yeah. I've got a big car and uh... You gotta drive a big car. I could easily kill a man. Workout.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:40.761 --> 1:12:42.499]: 
  I don't like fighting. I don't like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:42.499 --> 1:12:51.578]: 
  Listen guys. Being masculine is not something that I think about all the time. I've got a big car and you gotta drive.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:54.818 --> 1:13:38.102]: 
  Yeah, masculinity is whatever dude. It's not interesting to my personality, I don't think about it. Like everyone's like, oh yeah, you gotta be able to kill people in a fight. You'd be really mad. Yeah, yeah, that's like... It doesn't concern me. I'd like to know, like, Jude, did she just because it's cool to know? My problem is like people who are like, if we're gonna get into that, like, talk about like My Little Pony. We'll see the kid. And like masculinity, it's like who cares. Yeah, let's see if there's a kid walking around, he likes being a brony, he likes watching My Little Pony. Yeah? You probably wear skinny jeans. For a juicy one. He's probably sweaty all the time. I do like being in touch with him. What would you say to him? What would you say to him to be more confident? I'd be like... Because you want to be more masculine? Yeah, I think. And stop wearing fucking brony, like key rings on your goddamn... Yeah, faggot. Kill yourself. Kill yourself.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:56.489 --> 1:12:59.762]: 
  It's not a music from my first album yet.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:05.702 --> 1:13:06.951]: 
  Yeah, yeah, it's like, uh, but-

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:10.562 --> 1:13:11.271]: 
  My problem is like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:14.292 --> 1:13:16.688]: 
  and like masculinity, it's like who cares?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:20.080 --> 1:13:20.873]: 
  villa

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:22.122 --> 1:13:22.611]: 
  Thank you sir.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:23.725 --> 1:13:26.121]: 
  I do like being in touch with him.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:28.855 --> 1:13:31.504]: 
  I'd be like... Because you want to be more masculine, is it? Yeah, I think. And so...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:34.862 --> 1:13:41.882]: 
  You faggot. Kill yourself. Kill yourself! If you want to be more masculine, don't wear pinky pie t-shirts. That's not excellent.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:39.030 --> 1:13:40.397]: 
  Don't lie to me.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:41.157 --> 1:15:02.562]: 
  BITCH! If you want to be yourself wear pinkie pie t-shirts. If you want to be more rascan, don't wear pinkie pie t-shirts. Pinkie pie? But I do like being in touch with them and masculine. I didn't mean that. I'm kind of thinking like you're on a menu. If I was like, I'm afraid people don't take a masculine. The first thing I'd do would be like, you know. Do you like being in touch with your feminine side, Chris? I'm very feminine. Yeah, Chris is quite feminine. I wear yoga pants. He does. Every single day. Today we were moving shit into Chris's new office and... They're actually long johns. They're just really tight. No, they're yoga pants too. They're not yoga pants. They're long johns. They're long johns. Your bulge was loose. That's because I've got a big fat bulge. It was good. It was a good size. I liked it. You can have it. I think this whole whole fucking masculine thing is nonsense. That's because you're a big fucking bitch. Yeah, I know. But it's just all really comes down to is it's just like, what the fuck is masculine? You go into the gym eating steak? It's like, it gives a shit. Eat steak while you wear a fucking brony shirt, doesn't matter. It doesn't matter fucking if you wear a brony shirt. What it comes up to is if somebody's like, I think you're gay because you wear a brony shirt, you can just look at them and be like, all right, I mean, I figured not everyone's going to like the fact that they wear a pony shirt. You should acknowledge the fact that not everybody's going to blow your dick because you wear a girl shit. It's like, it's not going to happen. Some people might acknowledge it, especially in this time period, but for the most part, no one fucking cares. There's people that go out of their way to be like, I'm different. So they'll wear something really just like, look at me. And then they get made fun of and then they're like, what?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:46.439 --> 1:13:47.299]: 
  But I do like being in...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:49.223 --> 1:13:52.446]: 
  I didn't mean that. I'm kind of thinking like, if I was you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:59.061 --> 1:14:00.597]: 
  Chris is quite dumb.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:01.660 --> 1:14:03.246]: 
  He does every single day.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:06.199 --> 1:14:06.925]: 
  They're actually one.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:08.005 --> 1:14:09.591]: 
  No, they're yoga fans here. They're not yoga fans.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:10.553 --> 1:14:11.498]: 
  Chris.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:14.232 --> 1:14:14.654]: 
  It was good.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:15.497 --> 1:14:18.113]: 
  I like this you can have it I think this

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:17.438 --> 1:14:17.944]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:20.999 --> 1:14:23.631]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:09.049 --> 1:16:33.771]: 
  Of course man, people are gonna judge you if you wear a bright shirt. I see it like Corey is almost like wearing bait trying to get somebody to say something to him so... I don't know, I think Corey just likes the t-shirt. That's the matter. No, what is... This is the only shirt that's clean currently. That's the same with me, I don't know. Any time in a uniform shirt you only want to... Stop being... don't be a sissy. Don't be a girly sissy boy. Unless you're personality, you like to be a sissy. We're gonna be dumb.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:10.652 --> 1:16:13.605]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:19.394 --> 1:16:20.001]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:20.001 --> 1:16:20.929]: 
  This is the only

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:22.212 --> 1:16:22.954]: 
  They are not...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:23.714 --> 1:16:27.409]: 
  Anyways

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:30.227 --> 1:16:35.273]: 
  Unless you're personality you like to be a citizen We're gonna get so much shit for that No we're not

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:34.564 --> 1:19:36.629]: 
  We are there's gonna be bunch people like how do you tell someone not to be sissy, but they're asking how to be masculine So fuck you yeah, well this is fuck them They would be there this like on your skinny jeans get on your well I don't get why the fuck is that kid asking us and not John Cena I've never fucking done anything cool in my life And do video games need to be fun to be considered enjoyable slash good I know fun is subjective but with games like undertale is the experience message worthwhile even though the mechanics aren't inherently fun I feel like games with a really good story are fun They're fun to watch they're funny I don't find the game funny or it doesn't interest me at all like I found undertale charming and then they started throwing dad humor at me And I got tired of it Yeah, I want to hear what Jeff thinks about care I wasn't expecting to be this bullet hell game that was really sudden all sudden I'm like befriending a frog and next thing you know, I'm dodging bullets. Yeah, no, I can't escape them It does a thing too like the RPG mechanics bizarre like these fucking things It's just like you have to dodge them you don't get any really really refunded the game because I Fought a frog 10 times in a row and it got so boring. Yeah, actually No, you come up with the term frog it on slavy cast I maybe let me let me Now let me say something Let me say something about undertale because people are gonna be on my throat when it comes to undertale my experiences with it is It's a game where it's like, okay, you do something bad. You're always gonna be remembered for doing it bad unless you reset your game I don't want that. Okay. When I play a game and I fuck up. I want to do it again so I can get what I want Okay, when I was playing the game I was a part where you have to make a big decision and in every other normal game It's like oh you would just weaken the character and then you could save it at the end But this fucking game programmed it so when you weaken the character Suddenly you do like 300 damage and kill the fucking character and it like saves and you have to make a new saver You're always reminded of fucking up and I don't like that that ruins immersion that's different. That's terrible That shouldn't ruin a murder. It does because like when I play a game and I don't understand and I kill someone I liked and it completely destroys my immersion. I shouldn't ruin a murder. I was playing the game at the first time Then I want to be able to reset to a previous save I don't like games like that I don't like games that have Immediately introduced you to a mechanic you've never experienced before and then suddenly oh, it's real life It's like I don't give a shit when I play a fucking game I like going back to saves if I fuck up. Okay, that is not my kind of games Like okay, that's my fucking opinion for me I haven't played on a tale but it's all fucking fail What Cory said he doesn't like it's something I actually kind of like games when I played skyrim the first time I had the follower my follower was the fandal guy you meet in riverwood when he died I didn't restart my save it when he died. I felt really fucking I actually felt sad that like my god like this is so gay But like my character

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:40.808 --> 1:16:42.006]: 
  Yeah, fuck them. Next question.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:42.006 --> 1:16:44.166]: 
  They would be

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:45.465 --> 1:16:47.727]: 
  What I don't get is why the fuck is that kid asking me?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:47.727 --> 1:16:49.870]: 
  and not John Cena or somebody.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:50.849 --> 1:16:56.384]: 
  That's question! None of us are the most masculine guys. I am a pussy!

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:51.439 --> 1:16:52.992]: 
  That's a question!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:58.324 --> 1:16:58.544]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:21.797 --> 1:17:25.442]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:52.577 --> 1:17:53.438]: 
  Maybe, but let me...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:17:53.438 --> 1:17:57.302]: 
  Let me explain. No, let me say something.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:18:33.989 --> 1:18:35.963]: 
  That ruins immersion to me.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:18:46.864 --> 1:18:47.505]: 
  That's it!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:18:47.505 --> 1:18:50.712]: 
  So the first time then I want to be

 SPEAKER_00 [1:18:52.450 --> 1:18:53.496]: 
  But how is that a mercy?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:18:54.492 --> 1:18:57.985]: 
  You know, like real life consequences?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:15.484 --> 1:19:16.530]: 
  Blur! This might be...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:19.112 --> 1:19:22.319]: 
  But it's all fucking fail what Corey?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:36.156 --> 1:19:39.936]: 
  My character in Skyrim died, my follower in the next episode.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:37.928 --> 1:20:54.456]: 
  Phil said that your creepy voidless blankless NPC died. Yeah, no, let's let's think about this a character dies in your game Right. Yeah, let's say there was quests ahead of time that you couldn't do because you fucked up Yeah, and you don't find that out till 40 minutes later And you find out that everyone else is doing it a certain way and you doing it a certain way you like oh I want to experience that yeah, I feel and you can't reset to the previous fucking save to do that Because if your fucking choices you have you were doing common game knowledge You have to start an entirely new game. That's fine with me. I like that's not fine with me. It's like follow I it's fine. Also the humor is very subjective, but I haven't played it So I don't when you when you start like popping out like skeleton You yeah, oh yeah, right after gonna play it. That's another thing. Let's I'm gonna finish it I'm sorry. I don't mean to get such a fucking ranty this Of all the ponds in the world skeleton The thing is it's like I made a horrible decision and then I get introduced these fucking pony skeletons And I'm just like are you fucking making fun of me like I'm so mad right now And then these assholes are making jokes and I'm like fuck you dude I'm done with the game because it's like oh you're gonna laugh it off You're gonna laugh off that big mistake like nothing happened

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:41.927 --> 1:19:43.058]:

All you guys had to answer with is I'd go back 10 years because then you would have the same talent and you know everything that's gonna happen. I'd go back to year 975. They're not born yet. Yeah, I'd go back to 975. Isn't that what it's assumed? No, you would be in the same body but your same brain and personality. I want to go back to 900 BC. Oh, it's just, I don't know. Put me in third grade. I'll just be really smart. Exactly. Easy. You did it. You answered the question. You know what? You guys weren't satisfied with that question so I'm gonna do one more. What a dumb question. Fuck you. I liked it. Oh wait, that one's actually kind of funny.

I would, Jeff's lips, Jeff's eyelashes. I wish you stepped on my lips and eyelashes. I got good lips too though, Chris. I haven't finished yet. Jeff's lips, Jeff's eyelashes, nose, legs, and ass.
