 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:13.154 --> 0:00:36.745]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense. A world enveloped by a seemingly unending ocean of forests. Buried deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little cabin. And in that cabin...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:37.589 --> 0:02:30.702]: 
  Welcome to welcome to sleepy cast home of the sleepy cabin sleepy cast I'm Chris wait that was horrible That was perfect Okay, Mick. Yeah, what is your thought on girls who bleed out of the case? Oh out of their pussy Well, there's this new phenomenon going on I've seen more of it of recently and I don't really like it because I think it's gross But maybe that's just a bias. Is this this bleeder thing you were talking about? Okay, what the fuck is this bleeder thing is basically girls against the patriarchy and they think that the man made tampons for them To shut up shut that bloody vagina up So basically like these girls are going around and they're not putting tampons in so they're just like fucking staining everybody's like seats and stuff That's prove a point isn't that vandalism? I mean, that's my point like it's like these people think they're being outspoken It's like the reason why you stuff cotton balls in your pussies Ladies is this a real thing Cory? It's real. It's real Like have you ever seen one no, I've seen like a few posts of it and stuff and I've seen videos of people just bleeding Like walking around. Yeah, I saw that like artistic phenomenon I saw that artistic thing well artistic in quotes and she was standing at a window like a mannequin Yeah, and she was fully naked and she had like a big canvas under her and she was like free bleeding Yeah, yeah, it's basically like they just do manane things and just like they're free bleeding But basically my biggest issue is they think it's like this huge like thing where it's like oh Society wants me to wear a tampon so I can fit in but it's like no you're supposed to do that out of the courtesy of your heart You're being kind when you don't bleed on people and stain their you know what that would be like someone who had like a severe Assyllige problem and then they felt like they were being you know oppressed yeah oppressed because someone was like dude Can you please wear a diaper because you got shit all over my couch Nick.

  You know what? The ass leaking community are going to fucking go after you after this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:32.946 --> 0:04:36.437]: 
  Nick! Nick! Nick! Poopy butt syndrome is a very serious thing. And you know what? They tend to wear diapers, right? They come in droves. Poopy butts. They poop in droves too. Yeah, poop in droves. No, I'm just like, I don't understand how the whole free bleeding thing couldn't, it just seemed really rude. It's just like, it is, it's rude, and it's just inconsiderate. And it's like these people think like, oh, I'm being inconsiderate? I mean, if you had a bloody, bloody arm, and you were bleeding- I got a blade finger right now, I'm sucking on it. But like, you wouldn't just be like, oh, I'm just rubbing it all over your fucking couch and shit. I would not. Well, what do you think the cave women did? That's what I was gonna say, like, why did we evolve to bleed at our pussies? Well, because they're like- Speaking of that- Injecting their like, vaginal walls. I know, but fuck save us. I was doing research, and I was like looking at image fat for like, art and stuff. Oh, okay, of course. Spraying your pussies, because it's a good, it's a good referential place to find references for the kind of smut and dirty, porous art I do. Right. So I was looking for references on what to draw, and I noticed that a lot of older women tend to get these like, gray crustaceans around the edges of their pussies. Crustaceans? Yeah. They're fucking crabs. The pussies like- These like, smalls, lobsters. Do you remember that episode of Futurama, where at the end, the dudes like, bones like, fucking crippled into them? It was like, yeah, do you remember that? I remember that, yeah. That's what pussies do, because, you know, I noticed something. I noticed like, you know, like, teen and stuff you're not supposed to talk about pussies, or these prestige pussies- Pristine? That have yet to fall out, fall apart. It's not like, oh, do you see strange, like, a prestige level. Yeah. Yeah, and then you see like, these older women, and their pussies are falling out, graying around the edges. I don't understand. They're gray everywhere. They're gray there. Yeah, and one time when I saw an old lady puss, I was like, it's pretty gray looking. I mean, that's a lot. When I was in Vegas, I looked up out of a swimming pool, and I saw this old lady standing with big, baggy shorts, and saw right up there. Pussies are like a jellyfish. She was standing there like- Pussies, I guess, are like exposed wounds in every heel. Yeah. They're like, they're like, they're just constantly open and let the air flow in. Yeah, I always thought it was kind of dangerous, you know, you're talking about caveman times, and you know, animals like bears and stuff can smell menstruation- They can smell the blood. Yeah, they can.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:36.608 --> 0:02:37.992]: 
  And you know what? They can do it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:37.992 --> 0:02:39.072]: 
  Where diapers, right?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:40.590 --> 0:02:41.130]: 
  Mirror LOL

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:42.852 --> 0:02:42.936]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:42.936 --> 0:02:43.358]: 
  I'm just

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:46.480 --> 0:02:48.741]: 
  It's just rude. It is. It's rude.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:52.808 --> 0:02:54.445]: 
  And if you had a bloody, bloody arm...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:54.445 --> 0:02:55.474]: 
  and you were really...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:57.027 --> 0:02:57.043]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:59.727 --> 0:03:01.448]: 
  rubbing it all over your fucking couch?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:01.448 --> 0:03:02.511]: 
  Well, here we are.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:08.249 --> 0:03:09.885]: 
  Well, because they're like, ejecting their...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:16.619 --> 0:03:18.998]: 
  Oh, okay, of course. Spraying your pussies because...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:18.998 --> 0:03:19.335]: 
  It's a

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:34.995 --> 0:03:41.948]: 
  crustaceans yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:41.948 --> 0:03:41.965]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:45.880 --> 0:03:46.504]: 
  It looks like, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:46.504 --> 0:03:48.209]: 
  Yeah, you remember that?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:59.785 --> 0:04:01.371]: 
  what the fuck!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:01.371 --> 0:04:03.042]: 
  Like a prestige level. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:06.687 --> 0:04:08.594]: 
  around these ages. I don't understand.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:13.572 --> 0:04:14.955]: 
  What was in Vegas?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:18.027 --> 0:04:19.882]: 
  It's a song right up there.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:26.616 --> 0:04:27.038]: 
  Ja

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:28.759 --> 0:04:28.945]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:28.945 --> 0:04:29.198]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:35.745 --> 0:04:38.125]: 
  Yeah, they can. The ovulation, the hormones and shit.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:37.500 --> 0:04:47.727]: 
  It almost seems like a seems like something we would have evolved out of that's what I'm saying I would think that maybe pussies would eventually grow into a thing where they contract and go inside themselves

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:40.926 --> 0:04:42.462]: 
  That's what I'm saying!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:47.136 --> 0:04:53.464]: 
  Well, evolution doesn't have a set in mind. It doesn't know what it's going to do. But if pussies are supposed to be made as...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:51.490 --> 0:05:04.956]: 
  What are you doing? It's supposed to be made as baby makers But it works Yeah It's supposed to be baby makers in like baby fucking homes Um, then how come when a baby comes out is ruined forever? What the pussy's ruined forever? Yeah, because of the baby

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:54.527 --> 0:04:55.017]: 
  It works.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:02.661 --> 0:05:02.999]: 
  Wait the pussy's rolling!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:02.999 --> 0:05:11.402]: 
  ruined forever. The baby's big and the pussy has to expand much larger. Yeah but if pussies were made for that... They do trust me.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:08.415 --> 0:05:47.954]: 
  Yeah, but if pussy's like made for that they do trust me they kind of are because after they get torn open That's when like if you have like three or four kids You could accidentally just fart one out not even know because it's just been broken It kind of seems kind of weird though like everything's evolved to like shit babies out and break your fucking like hips and shit and your body changes Right, yeah, so you kind of think like why didn't we just mitosis like worms listen seems to make more sense This is incredibly insensitive and I'm not a girl, so I probably look like an ignorant But it's just something I've always thought was interesting that pussies aren't made to withstand tons of babies They are though. Well, they're supposed to but like men are supposed to

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:19.992 --> 0:05:22.304]: 
  They used sl这个

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:27.012 --> 0:05:27.231]: 
  like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:32.648 --> 0:05:34.926]: 
  Listen, this is incredibly insane.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:37.862 --> 0:05:39.449]: 
  We all do, Corey Cawar.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:38.014 --> 0:05:38.504]: 
  What happened?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:46.131 --> 0:05:54.450]: 
  What they're supposed to do, but like men are supposed to impregnate as many women as possible make them have as many babies as possible so they can like have like Yeah, but you destroy the foundation

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:52.442 --> 0:08:46.272]: 
  Yeah, but you destroy the foundation from the beginning and then it's no you don't maybe just fall out accident Yeah, but that's it like stitch your pussy back together when you're done with you don't have to evolution doesn't know that like when you I know but you should though it's evolution. No, it's not because like like the woman body is like Oh, yeah, the dick isn't gonna fucking feel my type pussy anymore. It doesn't care like it doesn't know No, but Cory Cory Cory Cory Free Bleeder. Yes, that's basically like my biggest issue, but it's like sorry on that I just have to say this is kind of a segue. I remember one of the the first times I ever went down on a girl No, this was so there's no names on this but when I lived in Malaysia and the girl I was dating at the time She had a really nice apartment, but there was an empty apartment across from her apartment So we went in there and it was dark, you know, it had a bed and it had some furniture But it was pretty much empty and you know, we were messing around we were having sex So she told me to go down on her. She was actually very adamant about me going down. Anyways, so I go down I go down and I'm like wow you are you are really wet and I don't know what's going on down here No, and then she put her hand down there and she's like oh my god. No, this isn't right Go turn on a light go turn around like so I go over I flip out the light and she screams There was blood all in between her legs all over this there was no sheets on the mattress It was just the mattress and there was also this big mirror that was like pinned up against the wall So she's screaming there's blood all over the bed. It's like oh yeah It's like a murder scene like a baby exploded out of a vagina or something And then I look in the mirror over and there's blood all over my face going down my chin Yeah, and I never wanted to go down on a girl after that it was very Ever I have since then I got over it the same thing happened to someone I used to know He actually went down on he went down on his girlfriend on went down on his blood relative on a The fourth of July you are from Missouri. Yeah, okay, sorry, but he went down on Her on the fourth of July and he said that while he was doing it He got this really strong spicy sensation in his mouth, but he kept going and he didn't know what it was And then later later Later on he found out and this is the best part, okay? Because the girl you know a part of the stereotype she was Mexican so she's a lot of spicy food So was he in his mouth? No, but she just happened to have spicy vagina. Yeah, she had spicy vagina That's absolutely true, dude, because if I eat too much hot sauce and I take a piss I can feel it burning my dick hole as it's coming out So she so she must have eaten like one of those like spicy midnight enchiladas and when he went down on her He tasted like her like spicy blood that like ovulated through her whole body Okay Ever gone down on someone or if they got down on you has the person going down ever been farted on

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:54.450 --> 0:05:58.264]: 
  from the beginning and then it's... Well, no, you don't......baby's just fall out accidentally. Yeah, but that's the...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:00.137 --> 0:06:01.960]: 
  You don't have to, evolution doesn't know that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:04.120 --> 0:06:05.554]: 
  No, it shouldn't! Why shouldn't I know?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:10.617 --> 0:06:11.190]: 
  It doesn't care about you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:11.781 --> 0:06:13.502]: 
  No, but he was sick that night.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:20.235 --> 0:06:20.624]:

It's disgusting I can't have sex You know what you can do?

  I'm being fucking serious That way you can handle anything because technically you can't smell anything you poke holes in it too if you need to see but what are you talking about? Oh my god. Can't blow up a fucking balloon and poke holes in it. Listen! What? I am me and my friends used to nigger rig so many things. Oh my god dude. Do I have to cut that out? We can say that. That's really cool. Or if you give context maybe we can keep it and go on. Okay, I'm not trying to be racist when I say it. It's just that the term like that would be like ghetto rigging stuff. Wait, are you remember Jerry rigging? Yeah, but it's the new term. It's the Compton term. This seems like the really racist term for it. We used to call it MacGyvering back in the day. It's called N-word rigging. So that's the new thing the kids are all about. Well anyway, because we were outside and my friends were like, man I need a barbeque and we don't have a fucking grill. So he's like, hold on. He finds some wire tin. He finds like some old cord thing and he just like sort of like wraps it around it and then he gets like this colon stuff and he makes a fireplace. A homemade fireplace made out of just shit laying around in his yard. And I'm like, what the fuck would you do? He's like, oh I just knew the... Wow. And it's just like a term. Like it's yeah, if you... Your friends are racist. For me. Like when I used to try and put things in my ass. If I had to compensate because I didn't go out and buy condoms I'd just use bags with fucking rubber bands at the end. Is that what that... I can barely feel shit with a condom on it. Like with a fucking plastic bag with a rubber band. You can't go inside a wheat thing when he puts something in his ass. It's one of those big black bags that you... That's a bin liner.

And you know what they're actually identical twins so they have the same face and the same butt She has the strength of Jurassic legs Okay, but she can crush baby dinosaurs heads. This is the dilemma! You ready? Both of them can't give good blowjobs a big gorilla fist with rick-a-cock up little t-rex arm would barely feel anything Okay, that's already like a deal breaker. That's shit I like blowjobs and girg-a-cocks. It doesn't matter what the deal breaker is there has to be a deal. I have to pick it. Okay, well, I guess I'd be less afraid of the fucking long-legged idiot

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:23.697 --> 0:13:24.945]:

  I don't want- I don't want- She always has the Brio top because you have Donkey Kong hands And put the fucking giraffe leg lady, she can run over and kick you to the sky and tell you I would probably go with the long-legged lady Yeah Cause she- she'd have the like little stupid arms You like little baby arms? You can still fuck her Is that what you like? You like her to touch you with her little baby arms? Make your dick look bigger You're gross Oh yeah You're pervert No, you're- That's what that's what this prove You're making me picked from dude two to four ditties It doesn't matter what you think, you would have been a pervert Oh, can I tell a story about today? Please That reminds me I was coming out of CVS Pharmacy and guess what was at the front door? A chip lady? No Chick with the front hands? Imagine a freshly born chick, like a gross little like fetus like veiny chicken It looks like chicken? Mixed with a little boy and that's what was there right? No And it was like a girl scout cooking Dude, I've heard of stuff like this, you know what it is? No, I was about to get to that right? This is the whole idea This was a conflict in my head right? You can walk out This lady walks up to you and she's like, do you want to buy some girl scout cookies? You look over at the girl scout, there's a girl scout And then there's the formed little chicken boy And you're like, what the fuck right? So I was like thinking, okay there's- No, no I didn't say shit, I was like I got no money Because I didn't have any money right? But this is what was going on in my head I was like, so did they put that little chicken boy there to make me feel bad and give them money? Or did they bring along her little chicken brother because she's really nice sister And I didn't know which one It should have just asked You should have just pointed right at the chicken boy And be like, what is up with this chicken boy? What is this? This is actually something, it's true I swear to God, no, I really think they put him there to make you feel bad Now that you mentioned it, he didn't look at me and go AHHHHHHHHH Did he like sin fuckers? No, he was worse, I swear, no, I don't want to be mean, but no I swear to God, they found the most deformed kid to put him there, I swear I've never seen anything like it, what? I'm not trying to be mean You know what, I don't understand, like if the girl scout was a chicken scout, like a chicken girl scout That would kind of make sense a little bit This is what I'm talking about But it's so weird, like buy my girl scout cookies And buy my chicken boy I'm a chicken boy cookies That is weird Like is this being mean, like I'm just trying to get my head around That's his job Did they put a little boy there, that's the form specifically so I'd buy their cookies No, no, the little boy was there Were they being really nice to him because they're great like mom and sister No, I'm not trying to be cynical, but that sounds a little too set up I didn't think so, I was like this is kind of fucked up That's really sad too, because it's like clearly the people that love him or take care of him Are like totally taking advantage of him too That's another thing, I was like if I had the form little boy, I'm not going to like I would leave my mom to play Xbox Unless you know what's actually was the mastermind And the little chicken boy's like hey, hey mom, you got to take me with Maggie to the store Because I'll just stand there and people throw money at him Dude, do you know what's fucked up realistically? Around Christmas time where that dude shakes a bell and expects people to put money into a little... Santa Claus? No, no, no, the... Jesus, man What's that called? Where they like, it's the... The Desolvation Army Yeah, if they had some like person with elephantitis doing that You would think people would take second glances and then when they actually see that this is a man with elephantitis They would donate You know, I feel like it's hit or miss, because half the people are going to feel guilty and want to give them stuff And the other half are just going to be like I feel like it's different though if you're just like some dude shaking a bell in people's faces when they walk by Or if you're like a guy with elephantitis, like people may turn and run or they'll... Most restores do this really cheap tactic, right? Where you get to the bagging area and then they have a charity and they're like, I'll bag your bag for you for free That's mainly like, you're like, fuck off, all you want is money, get out of here I don't want you to guilt me for giving you free money You know what, the other thing made me off so bad The other thing is like, let's say there's a long line of people behind you And you're buying like, let's say, a pack of cigarettes and a bottle of Jack, you know what I mean? Clearly you have money to engage in bad habits And they ask you for a dollar for, you know, cancer for kids And there's eight people behind you and you're like, no

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:06.880 --> 0:14:11.200]: 
  You always have to be on top because you have Donkey Kong hands and put the fucking drab blade

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:19.874 --> 0:14:21.949]: 
  You like little baby arms?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:21.949 --> 0:14:22.725]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:28.875 --> 0:15:29.939]: 
  It should have just asked.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:29.517 --> 0:15:30.951]: 
  You should have just pointed it out.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:32.571 --> 0:15:36.638]: 
  What is up with this chicken boy? What is this?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:38.545 --> 0:15:39.507]:

  rate

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:09.797 --> 0:16:11.367]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:11.367 --> 0:16:11.502]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:12.885 --> 0:16:14.978]: 
  That's his job. He didn't put his voice in there.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:17.155 --> 0:16:18.623]: 
  No, no, the little boy was that...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:21.897 --> 0:16:22.352]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:22.352 --> 0:16:22.690]: 
 還

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:27.887 --> 0:16:28.343]: 
  It's like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:30.452 --> 0:16:31.245]: 
  It's like, it's like, clearly.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:34.435 --> 0:16:35.009]: 
  That's another

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:34.840 --> 0:16:36.561]: 
  I was like if I had him

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:39.379 --> 0:16:41.995]: 
  I would leave my phone to play Xbox. Unless...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:41.995 --> 0:16:42.450]: 
  actually was

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:51.360 --> 0:16:52.289]: 
  Dude, do you know what sucks?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:57.537 --> 0:17:02.177]: 
  Santa Claus? No, no, no. Oh, Jesus, man. What's that called?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:03.190 --> 0:17:05.114]: 
  The Dan Salvation Army. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:08.894 --> 0:17:09.214]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:20.622 --> 0:17:22.394]: 
  I feel like it's different.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:35.489 --> 0:17:37.952]: 
  for free that's mainly like like fuck off

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:41.462 --> 0:17:42.644]: 
  You know what the other thing is?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:42.509 --> 0:17:43.707]: 
  This has been off so bad.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:49.495 --> 0:17:50.744]: 
  I see you in the videos.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:00.447 --> 0:21:02.427]: 
  What are you supposed to say? It's so fucked up! It's one thing if I'm going to a place like you say, like to buy like a fucking packet of cigarettes and brandy and just like... But it's another thing when you go to a place and you're going to a fucking fast food place like Burger King or McDonald's or you're just getting some quick food and then they're like, would you like to do need a dollar? It's like, can you really not... The shares are made to say that. They don't even follow whether or not... You know what is smart though is what I'm trying... The point I'm trying to make, what is smart is what Wawa does. They have a bucket on the table and start... Exactly! That's good. After you order, like after you give them money, the money goes to this little area thing and then you see this thing right here. You're just like, oh, I don't want to carry change in my fucking blog. It's like you just drop it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That is actually really smart. And you know what? I don't mind that at all. I don't either. And I usually do that. It's like, that would be way easier instead of saying like, here, donate. There's people who are dying. You just bought a dollar cheeseburger. It's just like, let me have the option. It's interesting because the difference between somebody asking you for money and then you feeling like you got robbed versus you just being like, yeah, I think I'm going to do something good today. There's a difference in how you feel when you give that money. Exactly. Nobody likes carrying around change. It's a genius concept. Just fucking throw it in. You're done. Yeah. And you save the world. That's true. Everybody give your change. By the way, please donate to our Patreon. To the chicken boys and to our Patreon. Every time you put your change in one of those little buckets, you feel like you're a great person. You're just like, look at the cashier. Yeah, but how would you feel if you had a fan for every time you threw it in so everyone was doing it and it became the coolest thing? You want to feel very good donating to it? Would you, Nile? Yeah, you big idiot. I'd fucking do it every day, Corey. Do you know what I think? Do you know what I think that chicken boy was there for? I think he was there to sell his own chicken boy cookies. Yeah, you didn't ask. You were getting snicker noodles. You didn't ask for chicken. Yeah, you know what? Yeah, the Girl Scout actually stole his cookies and shoved them into the gutters. Yeah, he's selling it. Little chicken boy was held by his own will. He could have broken free if he would have bought his chicken cookies. It was really weird, like, because there was a subway across the street. So when I sat down to eat a subway, I was just looking over at him and he was just like running around. And like the mom was like grabbing him and like bringing him back over. She had the Galicia on him. I was kind of like, look, all I'm saying is if I was a retarded chicken, I would just want to stay at home playing. That's all I want to say. You don't want to be dragged out to the store. If I was a retarded chicken, I would go on Xbox Live and scream at people at the top of my lungs. Ah! You squawk. So I mentioned to Chris before, I thought you guys were all a bunch of hot, sexy, young GQ Romeo's. Because every time we go out, we're always flocked by girls and they always walk right by me and they turn their noses up and then they walk right into your guys' arms. You're a big ultra bullshitter. What are you talking about, Mick? It's GQ, Jerry Curl. You know what? I hate you. So my question was, what is the dumbest thing that you've ever done for a girl? Like you would have never, ever in your life, ever thought about doing this and you even hated doing it when you did it, but you did it and you did it for a girl. Either because you had feelings for her or because you wanted to have feelings in her. That's a... I want... I figured at least now, considering your past Tinder escapades, that you would have at least a handful of these stories.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:00.852 --> 0:18:02.573]: 
  It's supposed to say it's so fucked up.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:15.482 --> 0:18:18.132]: 
  not here is made to say that they don't know what is my

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:23.363 --> 0:18:24.325]: 
  Exactly!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:31.328 --> 0:18:35.074]: 
  Yeah, that's genius. That is actually really smart.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:35.834 --> 0:18:35.952]: 
  at all.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:35.952 --> 0:18:36.660]: 
  I don't either!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:56.674 --> 0:18:57.450]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:57.450 --> 0:18:57.974]: 
  Everybody likes it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:04.909 --> 0:19:05.500]: 
  By the way, chicken.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:05.500 --> 0:19:06.259]: 
  Thank you boys.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:07.170 --> 0:19:07.491]: 
 ...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:14.123 --> 0:19:16.064]: 
  But how would you look at the cashier?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:33.090 --> 0:19:33.124]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:33.124 --> 0:19:36.752]: 
  Yeah, you didn't ask. You were getting snickerdoodles. You didn't ask for chicken. Yeah, you know what, bet...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:40.077 --> 0:19:42.557]: 
  He's so hate. Little chicken boy was held.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:54.606 --> 0:19:55.602]: 
  She had the Galicia on her?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:55.602 --> 0:19:55.956]: 
  Oh, it's kind of like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:59.095 --> 0:20:02.774]: 
  That's all I want to say. I don't want to be dragged out to the store.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:19.446 --> 0:20:21.404]: 
  They always walk right by me and they...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:23.699 --> 0:20:23.850]: 
  Click.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:24.728 --> 0:20:27.698]: 
  You're a big ultra bullshit

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:54.377 --> 0:20:55.289]: 
  All right.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:01.988 --> 0:21:04.502]: 
  It's not what you think I once worked at a

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:04.502 --> 0:21:15.437]: 
  supermarket for eight months for a girl so I could like live with her did she ask you to know but I needed to support myself and I did like if I didn't live with her I could have went back home and live there

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:08.299 --> 0:21:08.519]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:08.367 --> 0:21:09.177]: 
  Did she ask you to?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:14.999 --> 0:21:17.496]: 
  I pretty much gave up my whole fucking life.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:17.378 --> 0:21:21.141]: 
  Oh no, no, I was gonna say, after you worked there, did you, did you guys split up or what?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:21.141 --> 0:21:24.499]: 
  Yes. It's like eight months.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:24.499 --> 0:21:26.406]: 
  Sorry.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:27.334 --> 0:21:28.937]: 
  Yeah, but I'm...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:28.684 --> 0:21:56.562]: 
  I'm way better at doing that shit now. Like, when I was on a date recently, the chick brought me into Victoria's Secret. Why do they always fucking do that? No matter when you're with a girl, they always bring in a Victoria's Secret. This is the first time I met this girl. Brought me in there. I go, oh, that hand lotion smells nice. Because I remember seeing that. No, I'm not in a situation like that. Like, walking into Victoria's Secret, and they're like, well, I want that, like, really expensive gown over there. And I was like, well, that's not what Victoria's Secret's for. But I was like, oh, that smells like she got

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:28.769 --> 0:21:30.979]: 
  I'm way better at doing that shit now.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:36.109 --> 0:21:36.447]: 
  Why do they?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:43.855 --> 0:21:45.441]: 
  nice because I remember seeing that. No, I'm not.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:47.112 --> 0:21:47.382]: 
  I know.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:49.913 --> 0:21:50.807]: 
  I know, really.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:51.617 --> 0:21:51.634]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:51.634 --> 0:21:52.748]: 
  And I was,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:55.245 --> 0:21:57.743]: 
  I was like, that smells nice. She goes, bye, miss.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:57.557 --> 0:24:22.463]: 
  I was like, no! Like now I'm so much better. That's why she brought you in there. She just brought you into the store so you'd buy her something. Oh, fuck, fuck, go. Yeah, that's fucked up. It's just like, like, a nightwear and larger. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so she goes in. I was thinking of something else. She goes in, she finds the most expensive, sexy underwear, tries it on, shows it to you, latches you a little leg, and then she's like, you like this? And you're like, yeah, baby. And she's like, all right. I was like, yeah, credit card. Not enough to buy it for you. That's what I like. I was like, so I've gotten better at that. Like, I used to be a little bitch. I was never in this situation. You've never been like, one time I went back to Seattle over the summer and there was this girl and apparently she was really into, I didn't find this out until later. Yeah. You know what a colonic is? Yeah. No, sorry. She loved getting them? She would get them. It doesn't seem like something you get a dick in several times a month. What does that mean? It's when? OK, so basically what it is, is you lie down on this little bed thing. Yeah. And they take a plastic tube and they shove it up your butt hole. And then they fill your entire intestinal cavity with water. Like they just pump you full of water. Well, that's an enema. Hold on. Well, it's kind of like that except it's literally your entire intestines. And then you got to hold it, right? You got to hold it for a little bit. And the whole time you feel like you're going to shit yourself and they're like, don't worry, don't worry. That's totally normal. You're going to feel like you want to poop because there's like blockage in your intestines. All it is is when the water hits that wall, just let it happen. Don't try to poop this tube out. Just let it work its magic and it'll shut, it'll break through the wall. And then all of a sudden it'll fill up more of your intestines. Then when they're done, when you're totally full of water, Yeah. they suck it all out. And there's this machine. So all the water that was in your intestines comes pouring out or being sucked out through this tube. And then you can see all the stuff because there's like a clear tube. Yes, you can see everything that was in your intestines. So you can see all of like this intestinal plaque. You see all these little turd nuggets. You see, it literally looks like one of the levels from Battletoads. There's just like all this goo. Did she have like a, could you see a reflection in her butthole? Was it that clean? I never actually looked at her butthole. Oh really? I wasn't really into butts during that period of time. That's kind of the magic for me because like anytime I see a hot girl, I always think like, oh, there's a big old turd sliding around her intestines. And then like, yeah, but that chick, I guess not. No, she was clean as whistle. Why do you think of that? Why do you think? Because it's funny. I don't know. I just think it just comes in my head. I know it's not funny.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:59.937 --> 0:22:03.548]: 
  Now I'm so much better. That's why she brought you in there. She just brought you in there.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:04.139 --> 0:22:06.923]: 
  buyer so fuck up that's fucked up it's just

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:09.201 --> 0:22:12.019]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, so she goes in. I was thinking of something. She goes in.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:20.997 --> 0:22:22.482]: 
  I was like, yeah, credit card.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:21.503 --> 0:22:21.942]: 
  So yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:39.019 --> 0:22:40.977]: 
  The water colonic is... Yeah!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:43.559 --> 0:22:45.938]: 
  I didn't see myself getting a dick in seven times.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:45.938 --> 0:22:46.326]: 
  Yes, I'm on.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:02.695 --> 0:23:04.467]: 
  Well that's an enema.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:46.080 --> 0:23:48.510]: 
  You can see everything that was in your intestines.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:56.070 --> 0:23:56.813]: 
  Like, there's

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:06.550 --> 0:24:08.457]: 
  That's where the magic for me because like anytime

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:12.372 --> 0:24:16.658]: 
  And then like, yeah, but that's Jake, I guess not. No, she was clean as whistle. Why don't you think of that?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:15.949 --> 0:24:19.746]: 
  of that why I don't know it's why do you think now's a funny

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:19.746 --> 0:24:25.028]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:39.480 --> 0:28:14.950]: 
  But me and my friend Jack we used to like spread our butts up into the camera And they take a set and just get like a picture of our asses I don't know what it was about asses when I was a kid Everyone used to moon people when I was a kid That was a good thing It's funny, it's like you have to wonder how these fucking people at Microsoft these idiots who inquire these Webcam things they have these online things like people are gonna abuse this stuff People aren't gonna play fucking Uno with a bunch of million anonymous people And you're not gonna get these guys fucking little kids It's gonna be family sitting around and saying Oh yeah, I never understood that I never understood they make these fucking like webcam games And they don't think people are gonna abuse it Cause let's face it, if you allow somebody it's like with Dark Souls Originally when people are doing Dark Souls they were doing like horrible names Like they were trying to do as vulgar as possible And they're trying to get away through the sensors Those people are always gonna try to do it Those images I feel like it burned into your psyche Like when I was a kid, when I was in high school I went back to Seattle for one year And I remember I was with this group of guys and it was just because some of the guys in this group were friends that I hung out with when I was a kid before I left Washington So I remember we'd go out and I felt so terrible about it I mean besides TPing this one girl's house whose father was actually in the hospital with cancer I found out later Like the worst, the thought of like the mom and her having to go out and clean up They had a big yard too, just like cleaning up toilet paper and like their dad was in the hot I'd like never ever ever wanted to TP a house after that Anyways, but this one thing they would do, they would go around and moon people randomly on the sidewalks But they wouldn't just moon people, basically you know you're at a stop light Or someone's trying to do a crosswalk and they've got the hand and they've got to stand there and wait That means that when you come up to the red light, you know they're right to your side, they can see you And what they would do is they'd be like, oh excuse me sir, do you have the time? And they would look down at their watches because no one had smartphones at the time They'd look down at their watch and then all of a sudden one of them would get up and they'd stick their ass as far as they could Out of the window and spread their bunching so when the person looked back up from the watch They'd be staring right into the guy's ass and then we'd drive off laughing But in retrospect I just imagine like that was burned into their mind Like looking directly into this teenage boys butthole You never know what he could, like you were driving off but he could have been like coming in his pants That's true too You know what, what is this? And by the time he figured it out We were gone in a clout of smoke You got your glasses on? Yeah, I just wonder, yeah, the first thing you see is just a terrified face I saw this deformed kid's face

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:09.280 --> 0:28:11.001]: 
  I just wonder, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:11.001 --> 0:28:18.443]: 
  The first thing you see is just a terrified face. I saw this guy form the kid's face. He had one eye and it was squinting at me.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:18.443 --> 0:31:55.995]: 
  He was sticking his tongue out. Wait, you always realized you were talking about attention about girls and then we just totally went off. I was just saying, you know, there's really fashionable beautiful women in New York and they're walking along and they got these big high heels on and they're like wearing like this really great outfit and all of a sudden they got a really sexy walk and then they just fucking face plant. I saw one woman do this. Oh, I thought she was so funny. She was, when I saw her from across the street I was like, whoa. Then all of a sudden I was like, wow. Because you fucking like, and I was, we were talking about humanizing these people. Like when you see like these really gorgeous people, sometimes it's like they're almost not human. You know what I mean? They're like above human. Right, or right, exactly. They're like magazine covers. But when you see them do something human or when you think about them like taking a shit or something like that, it humanizes them. But watching somebody face plant really humanizes them. And it wasn't even her like literally face planting. It was everything that led up to that. Her legs like bent backwards and were kind of like just going in circles like little helicopters going in opposite directions. And then she face planted. But it was that awkwardness of that whole thing. Oh my God. And then like nobody helped her up. Everyone just kept walking like fire. I used to always like that because like like talk work in Ireland like the girls would get all dolled up and go out at night time. So like you could just, if you're just sitting in the car and you're looking out the window, you're like bound to see some girl who thinks she's the hottest shit ever. Just like fucking fall out of the window. Oh yeah, not only that, especially when they're drunk. Like you know you'll see like girls like all decked up and you know dressed really nice and then like they just like puke all over themselves or something like that. No, absolutely. We ever tell you what me and Nile used to do when everyone got drunk at the weekends in Ireland? No. So we used to live in the main street of Wexford which is the main town. Yeah, yeah, like right near the club. At 2am every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night people would be coming home like fucking tons and tons of people every night right? So we see lots of fights, lots of girls fall on their faces and shit. But one time I was coming home from America and I bought a Brookstone projector from the airport. It's just like a little 720p projector. Yeah, a little mini projector. But we hooked it up to Nile's computer and we got a picture of the Virgin Mary off of Google and we shined it on the building across the street. Chris after affected it to be like creepy and move like slightly moved a bit so she's like breathing up and down and there's like particles coming out. It looked really good. Yeah. We used to shine it on the building across from us and we'd find like lone girls walking home at night time. So there's not a single light on the street on it. We just shined this projector at the window and they look over and the second they look over you put your hand over the projector. So she disappears the second they see it. Yeah, so they look at it and they're like what the fuck? They don't know what the fuck they saw. Chris, do you remember the time when there were these girls walking by and we did it and they all saw it and they were like ahhhhhhhhh. And then they ran to their car and then the car came back and they stopped and they were like yeah this is where it was. And then we just did it again and they were like ahhh and they just drove off. They didn't like fucking shut themselves up. The actual best one though was when there was this guy right and he was with a girl and there was this corner right across from our flat where there was always people fucking down there like always right. But this one night a guy was walking with his girl and they both sat in the corner for no reason. Sure fingering her and sucking on her titties or whatever. So then we were just like get the exorcist face. We fucking got the scary exorcist face. We shot it on the wall. So the guys there like sucking on her titties or whatever and she looks up and she's like ahhhhhhhh. And he was at the angle so only she could see it. He probably met her that night at the fucking club. He probably thought she was having the weirdest orgasm ever. She's like oh my god I'm doing it right. And she's like ahhhhhhhh. He's like I'm good baby. But what happened was she looks up and she sees the fucking scary exorcist face and she screams. We cover it and he's like what the fuck. And she's like nevermind. He's like whatever he starts fingering her again. We did it again and she's like ahhhhhhhh. He's just like what?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:25.058 --> 0:28:26.459]: 
  This totally went off.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:38.052 --> 0:28:39.419]: 
  Oh, I'm so fine.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:52.986 --> 0:28:55.568]: 
  You know what I mean? They're like above human Earth.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:22.129 --> 0:29:25.960]: 
  and then like nobody helped her up. Everyone just got kept walking like fire.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:22.939 --> 0:29:23.496]: 
  helped her up.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:39.797 --> 0:29:40.590]: 
  Like you know, you'll see what's going on.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:46.446 --> 0:29:47.408]: 
  No, absolutely.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:50.429 --> 0:29:50.783]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:54.057 --> 0:29:54.951]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:54.951 --> 0:29:55.643]: 
  Like right near the

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:05.262 --> 0:30:05.582]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:11.573 --> 0:30:13.007]: 
  ś America Think What

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:18.981 --> 0:30:19.960]: 
  Well, no, Chris, the street...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:23.841 --> 0:30:24.533]: 
  So she's like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:33.021 --> 0:30:33.460]: 
  So all

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:41.054 --> 0:30:45.205]: 
  So she disappears the second they see it. Yeah, so they look at it and they're like, ah!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:42.994 --> 0:30:43.500]: 
  I can miss you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:51.904 --> 0:30:56.359]: 
  And then they ran to their car and then the car like the car came back and they like stop

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:00.004 --> 0:31:00.915]: 
  I'll be right back.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:01.995 --> 0:31:02.535]: 
  fucking

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:28.270 --> 0:31:28.506]:

  Which is like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:55.185 --> 0:31:58.864]: 
  What? Eventually they got up and left, but like that lasted about an hour.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:58.341 --> 0:33:49.598]: 
  I thought it was gonna get like all like really sad and stuff like you just heard smack it or you guys Don't really terrible about starting a domestic dispute. We just used to scare the fuck it was just a simple little projector It wasn't even that good It was it was actually more so the fact that it was it was such a bad projector that you just got the faint image So it wasn't too obviously a projector It was more so like you could definitely imagine these people seeing it and being like was that my brain? That's right because it was so faint on the wall. I feel like that faint though That's like one of the biggest problems I think with horror films nowadays is that they're so clean yeah, not so well Yeah, that like it's what was so awesome about the old ones was that it was kind of grittier Yeah, like your imagination had to fill in the blanks. Yeah, and like with these nice ones It's like oh, you know, they're more grotesque deaths But they're so clean like the visuals are so clean that you see everything and it doesn't look real or it doesn't matter Yeah, yeah, fuck that these bitches the second they see the Virgin Mary you cover it with your projector So they're like it was one frame, you know Telling the story is gonna cause so many car accidents Like some kids gonna go out and do this and people are gonna be driving into telephone poles and shit But you know what else made it creepier to them though the people who saw it and believed it was like the Virgin Mary Okay, so they saw a Virgin Mary and they're fucked they're scared now right but for the people who knew it was protected They're like there's some creepy fucking bastard. Yeah point in the project that's even almost scary Someone was watching Sometimes like we do it and then a guy would just go and just like like yeah He looked right up right up at the exact second like we and we'd shit our pants Yeah, did I ever tell you that one time I used to have a green laser pointer And I'd stay up till like four in the morning like shining the street of people Sorry one time okay, so we were surrounded by other flats, right one night I just got the pointer and I pointed it into every single flat window for like probably 10 second bursts, right? Just to see what happened and nothing happened. I was like alright I went to bed and then I fucking woke up and just heard like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:03.100 --> 0:32:03.505]: 
  Don't really

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:46.491 --> 0:35:54.827]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:48.060 --> 0:35:49.461]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:51.233 --> 0:35:57.612]: 
  Okay, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what he would say. Exactly, but I'm just trying to say like why he's wrong. But anyway.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:57.578 --> 0:36:09.863]: 
  Oh my god, you just so weaseled yourself into that dispute. But anyway, um... I'm gonna keep that in just so everyone knows what a weasel you are. We're off that topic, just answer the goddamn question.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:03.771 --> 0:36:04.412]: 
  I'm the king

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:09.374 --> 0:36:21.456]: 
  All right, all right, I pussy my way into that one. Okay, so the thing is I jack off and I'm like I'm gonna I hear you like I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it and then the second you come like God that's disgusting Dude, I'm the same way

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:18.098 --> 0:37:36.010]: 
  Like, Zach, God, that's disgusting. Dude, I'm the same way! And I do it, and I'm like, oh, because it feels good, then you're like, where's the thing? See, me, you know that whole... You almost want to, like you, but you won't do it. Yeah, why do you want to do it? Why do people want to do that? That entire dispute you had with Stanford and Zach, right? There's a point where you get so horny, like, I'm gonna do something horribly dirty. I'm gonna drink all of my cum, right? That's it. And you aim your dick up in your mouth, right? But then you're like, no, no, no, I won't do that. I'll just come on my hand and then I'll eat it when I'm done. But then the second you come, you hold it up and you're like, oh, and you put it away. Chris, I tried to, like, aim and come into my mouth, but the farthest I got was, like, the middle of my chest. I think you literally dodged that bullet. I was okay. Because you were looking down like, oh, thank God. Also, you have to train yourself. Also, I was edging to try and have a little push behind my penis. So I was like, all right, I'm edging now, so I'm really building it up. So you timed your twist. Oh, it still just so like shot up. I don't think you really tried. Because the really easy way to do it is you get in, like, a sit-up position with your legs on the bed and your back on the floor. I don't really know. And then what you do is you flex your ass a little bit. So it's basically like there's no way you're going to miss. In fact, you should close your eyes, because you're probably going to hit yourself in the face.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:24.848 --> 0:36:27.801]: 
  See, Mick, you know that whole...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:27.447 --> 0:36:27.464]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:27.464 --> 0:36:27.497]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:30.366 --> 0:36:32.442]: 
  Yeah, why do you want to do it? Why do people want to do that?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:32.442 --> 0:36:32.830]: 
  that interface<|en|> applied for that team?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:41.369 --> 0:36:41.942]: 
  That's right.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:41.942 --> 0:36:42.027]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:43.596 --> 0:36:44.052]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:50.042 --> 0:36:50.987]: 
  You put it away.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:50.987 --> 0:36:51.460]: 
  I'm sure

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:57.164 --> 0:36:58.446]: 
  I knew you'd die.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:59.999 --> 0:37:02.007]: 
  I was okay, I also- Cause you were looking down by-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:02.007 --> 0:37:02.496]: 
  I'm so-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:02.496 --> 0:37:06.867]: 
  Oh thank god. Also, almost did. Also! You have to train yourself.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:05.500 --> 0:37:06.614]: 
  You have to train your

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:16.975 --> 0:37:19.304]: 
  I still just saw like the, I don't think it would be.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:26.037 --> 0:37:27.117]: 
  I don't really know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:35.318 --> 0:37:37.917]: 
  Wait, you get further range when you flex your ass?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:37.765 --> 0:37:46.050]: 
  No, I'm saying that if you have literally, if you're in a sit-up position and you've got your legs on top of the bed and you're flexing your ass, you know, like you're, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, flexing your ass. Because then, you know, you're like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:44.194 --> 0:37:48.194]: 
  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I look to your ass. Because then it shoots higher up and then kind of, No, it shoots higher up.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:47.181 --> 0:38:43.544]: 
  No, it shoots down directly into your fucking head. I don't do that. I've never done that before. I'm just saying if you were in the- This is what I do. Honestly, trying to get it in your mouth, that's how you do it. I try to get comfortable because it's like you kind of got to get into the mood, but I never go like fucking like a kid. You never jack off upside down? I don't like- None of you guys have ever jacked off upside down. No. Dude, you get blood rushing to your head. It's almost like- I'm gonna try that. I'm gonna fucking try that. I'm gonna try that a little bit, but it's not as bad really like choking yourself or something, but if you're jacking off with your head over the bed, like you know, if you've got your back to the bed and your head's kind of down, the blood rushes to your head. And it feels better? Well, you know what? I'm cutting off this. I'm doing that, I'm gonna get back. And then I'm gonna practice a special- Everyone's gonna think I'm a fucking freak. When someone was fucking a girl in her ass. I came in her ass. In her butt? She farted out. She said, this is comfortable.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:51.417 --> 0:37:55.450]: 
  I've never done that before. I'm just saying if you were in the- This is what I do.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:56.901 --> 0:37:58.217]: 
  I'm out. That's how you do it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:09.996 --> 0:38:10.249]: 
  So.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:12.679 --> 0:38:15.531]: 
  It's almost like a try that I'm gonna try that asphyxied

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:32.490 --> 0:38:33.014]: 
  Oh no!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:35.393 --> 0:38:37.924]: 
  I wrote this gonna take a fucking freak

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:40.034 --> 0:38:40.945]: 
  your ass and her white.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:44.354 --> 0:43:13.392]: 
  Was it bubbly? And then you ate it? Yeah. And you were like, this is comfort food? Generally when you sneeze, do you also find yourself farting as well? Well, that's because I have. Because when you sneeze, it contracts your bowels. Yeah, yeah. But have you ever been afraid that you may actually like... Shit yourself? Yeah. If you have like severe, like sometimes when you're sick, you do kind of have the squirts going on. It happened to me, too. You're also like sick, so you have like sneeze and sniffles and all that. And so yeah, I mean, I think I may have like squirted a little, a little sharp. I'm always terrified. Like when I'm sneezing and I'm like, I'm always like, oh, I don't even... It happened to me on that couch. I don't know how forceful it was. Oh, cool. Oh, actually, I think Zach was saying that. Yeah, it happened to me right on that couch. Yeah, right when Corey's sitting, right? Right where you're sitting. Corey, you're sitting in Chris's shit. No, it's sitting with your sit. No! You're sitting on my green turd. You're wallowing in his green turds. No, I shat in my pants and I wallow through the bathroom. Wait, today? No, it was like completely free-assing everywhere. I wallowed in his green turds. Zach, like, spoon fed me like gross sardines. He's like, Tastes just tastes good. Actually, the only time, I don't know if I said this before, but the only time I ever actually shit in my pants, like, like... Full blown. Yeah, like actually shit myself because... It was coming up the back. I feel like there's situations in everyone's life that at some point in their life they are going to shit themselves. Not when they're old, like old men who don't know like the fucking time of day is, but like, you're just going to be... Something's going to happen. You're in a situation where you can't help it and you're going to shit yourself. That happened to me when I went with my father to Aldi's. Aldi's, yeah. I needed to go to the bathroom really bad. And when I went there, I sort of had the idea that there would be a bathroom there because it's fucking Aldi's. Right. There wasn't a bathroom there. So I was there and I'm like, I'm going to shit my pants. Like, I was already like wincing and stuff and really... You know they have a bathroom. They didn't. Because the employees have to use the bathroom. They didn't have a bathroom. Not in this Aldi's. Well, they had to for the employees, but they didn't let customers in there. Yeah. That is so... They're like, you're just going to stand in the aisle and shit. So, he would, in like, in Aldi's, you also have to pack your own stuff so you kind of go to an area to like pack your stuff. So while I was doing that, I shit my pants. What fucking supermarket is this? It's Aldi's. I like to pack my own groceries. But I would... But that's my situation of where I've shit myself. What about you guys? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, And but, but I recall like later on thinking back on that. And, and it was kind of the first signs of like, I knew that I would become like a workaholic. Like, I knew that I would have the attention span and I would have the will and the drive. I was with my father. I never thought because I myself, I'm somewhat of a work person. I work every day, I have no problem with it. I love to work. I never thought I would because with my dad, he always found like grunt work to do around the house. And he would buy like a fucking bus and he'd be like, we're going to fix this up. He would spend like 15 grand on a bus and he'd, or 1500 on a bus and he'd be like, we're going to fix it up and it's like broken and stuff. I was like, I'm never going to be into this stuff. I'm never going to want to have to work and do shit every day. But he was just buying stuff for you to do. So you'd like buy a bus, brand new, and then you take a crowbar to it. Yeah. And be like, fix it. Yeah. He'd fucking bash out the windows. He'd be like... And then he'd put a bomb to your neck and be like, you got an hour to fix this. Go. Now talk about shit. Fine. Fine. I was working in a supermarket and I was like literally about to get fired. It was the same supermarket that I was talking about earlier. You just shit yourself to just despise them. No, but literally like on the... You're fired. Literally on the way in. I quit.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:48.201 --> 0:38:48.454]:

  I'm always doing this.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:24.179 --> 0:39:25.005]: 
  I don't wanna be on that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:25.005 --> 0:39:26.507]: 
  That was how forceful it was.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:26.507 --> 0:39:28.144]: 
  Oh, cool. Oh, actually, I think...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:28.769 --> 0:39]: 
  saying that.

I will bring in a game boy. I'll bring in a comic or a novel. I love taking the shit I just don't want to imagine that I'm like I've got the same, you know ass imprinted somebody else It's like I can't do is that he walks into a bathroom. He sits down. He's shocked. He goes he's done What yeah, that goes on your shit He's just fast and he's right back. It's weird right back downstairs, but fucking me too. I don't take that long to shit I like sitting down. I like fucking just just letting my sphincter go loose Yeah, and then you just wait for it all to fall out over 20 minutes. Oh, yeah There is nothing left. You guys have ever been halfway through a shit, and then you sneeze and it cuts you turd and have yeah Yes, absolutely. It's just like some way.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:24.499 --> 0:57:43.011]: 
  What happened? Me and my 26 year old sister. We were shitting in the bathtub. Yeah, we were shitting in the bathtub. I didn't tell the story when I was like 4. My sister was, wait, I must have been 3 actually. My sister was 4. In the bathtub, we're both taking baths because that's what like brothers and sisters do and your parents are like Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:29.612 --> 0:57:30.962]: 
  Yeah, we were shaking fast though

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:31.283 --> 0:57:31.772]: 
  Oh wait.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:31.772 --> 0:57:32.835]: 
  I didn't

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:42.336 --> 0:57:47.449]: 
  Yes. Parents were like, ha ha ha! What I was just like. Just wait till you're older! I just remember saying that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:45.205 --> 1:01:10.219]: 
  Just wait till you're older. I just remember sitting there, and I just started pissing. And all I remember is my sister looking down and seeing the yellow coming at her. And she was just like, ah! And she was like, ah! Just grabbed her right on time before the piss like, ah! I thought she was being so scared. She was like, ah! Just like splashy. It was like spring everywhere back at you. No, I swear it was like Indiana Jones. It's like right before the thing. Tucker at right before the pee hitter. Who should we talk about turds and pisses? It's just an easy good like point-to-point conversation. Everybody poops. Everybody pees. Like that book. Yeah, just like that book. Everybody comes. Everybody comes. Where's that book? Everybody comes. Here's a horse. Here's a cow. Everybody comes. You were learning about anatomy growing up, and you were like typing in. Like you were typing in vagina and penis. Yeah. You get these images of dicks being cut apart and just like you have like boils on their penis. Actually, the worst thing to do is to Google something like vagina or penis. Because oftentimes you'll get a whole bunch of things like burn victim penises or like dissected penises. Yeah, and then you'll see like a porn shot too. Then you'll see like, you know, Lex Steele or Peter North. And then you'll get all the dicks. You'll see like someone who cut open a dick so it's like still bleeding and shit. So you're getting a mix of like, you know, porn, sexy images, clinical diagrams, and like horrific, dissected, tragic accidents. I was doing a project on cows. And I needed to know the anatomy of a cow. So I was looking up cow anatomy. And I was looking up, like I was learning certain words. Like there's certain parts because they're not the same as us. I mean, they are, but they're not. And I was getting these just like horrific fucking images of cows like fucking like, you know, like horse flies and shit eating apart. They're like pussies and stuff. Even if you Google image something like smiles, you'll get like these people who had like car accidents and their faces open and shit. Yeah, or like Glasgow smiles. Yeah, yeah, or yeah, you'll get some weird creepy like, yeah, somebody got cut along the sides of their mouth. If you look up like, if you look up like burn victim, you'll get like happy families like eating fucking like turkey sandwiches, just like nice images. But if you actually look up like happy family, you get like fucking burlated family. Yeah, that's right. Like like all of them. Like they were actually happy family. I never understood that. It's like, I thought Google was supposed to be like family oriented. How can we give me all these like clinically things? That's because you turned off, you turned off, you turned on the show me disgusting shit button. This is a safe filter. You know what's Google got rid of porn now? Yeah. Yeah. What? But they never said it. They just did. You just noticed. No, no, no, no, they didn't. No, they did. They did. Like it must have happened last night. Because the addresses are still up. Like you can still go to like websites, but the images. Yeah, Google images, you can't see porn anymore. It's very... Even if you turn off, like turn off save search, it's just like, if you look up, like you might get like a boob shot or something. Yeah, if you look up like like sexy tits or something, you'll just get like girls and bikinis. Yeah. Very G-style. I'm pretty sure. Hey, what you're getting is what you were talking about. You'll just get girls with like fucking like their titties are getting cut open to be filled with like, like what do you call that stuff? Milk. No, girls don't get their titties cut open to be filled with milk. What do they get filled with? You mean silicon? Yes. Oh, okay.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:55.684 --> 0:57:56.916]: 
  I was like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:59.093 --> 0:58:01.422]: 
  I thought she was being...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:03.666 --> 0:58:07.564]: 
  It's like splashy and it's like spring everywhere back at you. No!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:13.437 --> 0:58:13.454]:

  Wait a minute! You're gonna drink your own titty juice, but you're not gonna eat your own comb? AHHHHHHHHH! Yeah. I see, see this is where I think, and listen we're not going back to that, but I do think that bodily fluids are bodily fluids. Yeah, it's your own. And there's nothing- That's exactly what I think. What the heck? Your body fluid. Your bodily fluid. No, but it doesn't matter. That was my initial thing. It was like, if you eat your own snot, or if you swallow your own snot, or if you eat and crud out of your, whatever, your fingernails, or your- If you eat your snot, you're gay. Yeah, we don't need to go there, but yeah. That happened in- oh, can I tell a story? Yeah. You reminded me, I used to sit- okay, in school, in math class, I used to sit next to this gross freak, I can't say that. So I listen to it. Okay, okay, sorry. Why can't you say that? Thal gross smelling fucking Ethan. It was a mirror. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Just in case you listen to it, I need to be nicer, okay? Okay. Okay, so I used to sit in a math class next to this tall, lanky, weird fellow. With thorns in one. It's so much nicer. And one day, one day he just fucking sneezes, and he just turns to me, and he holds his hand up to me, and it's like a spiderweb snot. Ehhhhhhh! And he was just showing me. Ohhhh! Like, why would- why, like- Look what I did! Yeah, like, if I did that, I wouldn't just show it to- I'd be fucking embarrassed, like fucking wiping under the desk or something. Dude, that happened to me not too long ago. I was like- I thought it was a normal sneeze, but then I had this, like, huge, gunky spiderweb thing in my hand. I'm like, ehhhhhh! I didn't know what to do with it! There's an alien baby in your hand! It was gross! It's like my whole fucking hand, like I said, like I stuck it in Kid Gack, and I was like, ehhhhhh! What is it about- what is it about when we were kids? I remember when I would have these, like, stuffy noses, where, like, I was blowing bubbles with snot, and it was, like, crust, like, all along my upper lip. And when you got scabs, they were, like, little mountains, like, they were, like, these big, huge, chunky chocolate chip cookies on your knees and shit. We would have, like, I don't know, I just felt like everything was crustier, and bigger, and goopier, and grosser, and smaller, the scabs, like, the denser, like, always stays the same size, so when you grow up, it just seems smaller. Ohhhh, that makes sense. Yeah, yeah, girl. Thanks, Dr. Science. When I was sitting in school, I sat beside this girl, and, uh, she was, she'd always, she was really annoying. I think she had a crush on me, and she kept going.

  journalist

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:46.165 --> 1:12:38.669]: 
  Yeah, you can think of it. I can prove it. I love that one. I wish they had gang bang in the category there. You see it, I do. You see it like baby wear shit. Little kids pushing the stroller's smile on it. I don't know what. So like that is like electronics, you know, for sure. Gang bang. So what? So Chris, I'm on HowWantTV.com right now. And it starts off with a load of categories. What's your go-to category? I go to short hair. Chris. What? Yeah. Short hair. Really? Yeah. That's such an interesting category. I love short hair. Look for ass licking. Have you ever dated a girl with short hair? Told you. Ass licking is right there. Right there. Ass licking is always important. Have you ever gone out with a girl and she was like, hey, what could I do to spice things up? What do you like that I can do besides being like, suck my dick? But you'd be like, I want you to cut your hair. Would you ever do that? Probably. Really? If they offered. Wow. I'm actually, I don't know. That's something that's never bothered me. Would a girl be hotter? Let's say you were going out with a girl, she had long hair, you thought she was hot. If she had short hair, would she be automatically become hotter? This is something about it. I don't know. Hair doesn't bother me. What if she had a shaved head? Like the shortest of hair? Yeah. Really? It's closer to a boy. Like I prefer the pixie cut. It's like Captain Picard. I like those punky shaving cuts. But I don't know. Yeah, pixie cuts. I saw something. Olly showed me, there was like a thing that they did a vote thing. And it said that more girls were into being strangled. Yeah. They're into feeling like the victim. You have no idea how many there are like that. Yeah, I started to notice that. I started to notice that these girls, and it's funny too because these people are like, they freak out about rape, but a lot of girls have huge fantasies about it. I would actually say almost all of them. And I'm not saying they all have rape fantasies, but they all want to be rough. They want to be bad. It's the danger, but it's still safe. They know that you're not going to kill them. Like me, I would love to be restrained, but I would be terrified at the same time. Even if, I mean, that's what, I know I could do it with Lexie. Because she could just bite your dick off and then run. Exactly. Just run down the street. You have to have a trust thing, and you have to be able to experience that. And I would like to think if Lexie had something, if she really wanted me to do something to her, that I would do it. I wouldn't have any problems doing it. I actually think that's one of the prime, I think that's really healthy. I think that's one of the prime, one of the bullet points that a lot of people who are into bondage, when they talk about how it strengthens relationships, like a lot of people think it's weird that you choke people or tie people up or whip them or whatever. And then one of the arguments is, well, it actually takes a lot of trust to be able to do something like that. And if you're ever willing to go there, if you're willing to give in to that, that you really trust that person, I can see where that comes from. When they want to be strangled, they don't actually want to be like fucking strangled. Like, you just, you generally do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And same with pulling the hair, you get a clump of it and you kind of pull it, you don't pull it at the roots, you don't make it like that. You just kind of like, kind of wrap it up and you go, Yeah, they're like, yeah, they like the whole restraint, they can held down while you do stuff. I'm learning so much from all you guys. Listen, the next time you get a girl, but I'm gonna go, it gets weird sometimes. You're shivering shit against the side of the bed. Yeah, it's hard to protect. Some guy like, you know, sucker punching the girl like square in the nose. I just feel like he's punching her. She'd be like, oh yeah, I just fucking break her nose. Yeah, that would be not good. You know a lot of girls are actually into, if you get like pliers and put it in fire for like 10 minutes. Shut up. No, no, it's hard. There needs to be brand to do. No, Mick, I'm telling you, you put pliers in fire for like 10 minutes, right? Mick, you can get both fists. You jump one upper, push one for the rest. No, it's serious. Get them nice and wide. You get it. Then you shove the pliers in and rip out the gooch. Oh my God, Chris. It's serious.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:50.924 --> 1:08:52.493]: 
  You see it too. You see the

  I like to growl.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:36.932 --> 1:10:43.446]: 
  I would actually say almost all of them and I'm not saying they all have rape fantasies, but they all know like they don't want to be rough They want to be mad

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:43.446 --> 1:10:43.750]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:45.657 --> 1:10:47.749]:

I'll just say that and I used to call her Donkey Kong and make all the walking noises. There when I was in elementary school there were these two girls uh Elisa and Nell and I had to crush up both of them actually. And at one point I remember I don't know why I thought it would be good but I walked up behind them while they were talking and I slammed their heads together. Oh my god. I don't know why! I thought it was... Both died instantly. I think it was just like you know like give me attention or something. Oh man, oh I forgot. When I was 11 uh I was in school and um this girl who was heavy was in my class and uh she was she she was out sick or something. And the teacher was like oh where is Nicole?

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:30.270 --> 1:16:37.855]: 
  No, I remember, and I still have this problem now, but there are times when I want to blurt out the worst fucking thing. That was one of the things where I wasn't thinking, it just came out of my mind. Right, exactly. I've had to learn to censor myself. But I don't, even today, I mean, not today, but even now, at this age, and this time, I'll be standing in line, and I'll see an old lady, and just a part of me wants to just push her as hard as I can while she's got her groceries. I don't know why. Dude, I get the same impulse. Am I crazy? Because you're psychos. No, I get the same impulse. I see. I would never do it. No, no, yeah. I see this person, yeah, a really feeble person. I'm just like, when we're having, I fucking just push them off the side. Or you go into a really expensive place where stuff costs like three grand. And you just want to bring everything. You just want to fucking shove it over the counter. That's like that thing where you're flying an airplane. You're like, I'm going to fly this into Twin Towers. But you know when you go to a mall, and you're on the third floor, and you can always sit down like the balcony onto the marble floor, you always think like you could just easily just jump off. I have. I have been like, if I jumped off, I could probably live, but then just not function again. I was like, I could be dead in front of you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:15:38.235 --> 1:15:38.759]:
