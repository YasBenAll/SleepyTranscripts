 SPEAKER_01 [0:00:49.485 --> 0:00:53.957]: 
  going to tell the story of why Easter came to be. First of all, isn't Easter in

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:52.506 --> 0:01:17.447]: 
  First of all isn't Easter in April what I always thought Easter was a Easter is a heathen holiday It's not even a havens. Phaven's Phaven's Phaven's. It's one of those words even people who worship a false deity Cory Everything Cory these two don't know the story pagan Easter Easter is a pagan holiday Outside of anything that people know about Jim Jesus Christ in you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:54.649 --> 0:00:56.269]: 
  I always thought Easter was Easter.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:56.944 --> 0:00:58.075]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:36.837 --> 0:01:43.265]: 
  Yes, I just think it's woke up and we found all the eggs lying under rocks in the garden. The only thing I think it's done is I think...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:40.819 --> 0:02:00.192]: 
  The only thing I think it's done is I think it's done that it's treated like a Christmas holiday like people don't work on Easter It's because it's always a Sunday. It's nationality has to work. Yeah, but even Sundays are generally like that day where it's like Oh, it's Sunday. Yeah, you can still go places. It feels like Easter. It's even worse. That's being shut down

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:48.092 --> 0:01:51.805]: 
  Because it's always a Sunday. It's national state testing. So nobody has to work. Yeah, but even-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:54.876 --> 0:01:55.180]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:57.407 --> 0:01:57.997]: 
  Oh, that thing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:57.997 --> 0:02:09.490]: 
  Shut down more place. What I hate about America is it's full of bullshit holidays like every like second week that close every store Yes, exactly every time I go to the bank. It just happens to always be on one of those stupid

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:04.562 --> 0:02:05.862]: 
  Yes, exactly.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:08.342 --> 0:02:12.055]: 
  I said this before. What is the dumbest one to you Chris Martin Luther King? Easter.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:11.211 --> 0:02:15.531]: 
  Easter. Oh, Martin Luther King is fine, right? That's fine. Easter. But there's like,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:13.489 --> 0:02:27.344]: 
  That's fine. What there's like, there's one of them that's just about employees or something. Is that Labor Day? Yes! That's stupid fucking shit. What about Martin Luther King month? Martin Luther King was a great man but I don't- That's Black History Month.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:18.754 --> 0:02:20.492]: 
  Is that Labor Day? Yes! Labor Day.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:19.547 --> 0:02:21.150]: 
  Yes! Labor Day. That's stupid.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:21.809 --> 0:02:22.635]: 
  Sick of that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:24.880 --> 0:02:29.520]: 
  great man that's black history month get it over to the bank just to have married with a king

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:29.520 --> 0:02:40.945]: 
  slap me in the face and send me home.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:31.714 --> 0:02:32.170]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:31.950 --> 0:02:32.507]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:33.520 --> 0:02:33.537]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:33.537 --> 0:02:35.359]: 
  Independence Day.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:36.389 --> 0:02:50.243]: 
  or 10 shit no that's not the true day again what's the veterans veterans that that's why can't we just like celebrate these days but also work oh you mean why doesn't everybody else work I mean this is like ah thank god for the they're not thinking about veterans that is the best thing about holidays holidays

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:43.172 --> 0:02:45.636]: 
  Oh, you mean why does everybody else work?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:48.302 --> 0:03:03.945]: 
  That is the worst thing about holidays, because holidays are the days you'd imagine where you'd want stores to be open so you can go do stuff. That's what I mean. Because yeah, because you're not working so it'd be great if the liquor store was open or the fucking restaurants were open. Their bars are closed dude, we tried to go into Blue Comet like two hours ago when it was closed.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:54.090 --> 0:02:54.884]: 
  ¡Estás por emil!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:57.921 --> 0:03:00.014]: 
  Yeah, they're bars are

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:03.490 --> 0:03:09.092]: 
  Like if every store is closed and you open your liquor bar, no one's gonna come in because nobody's gonna be even be out except for one guy called Corey.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:08.957 --> 0:06:00.897]: 
  There will be crazy people coming in with their fucking rabbit hoodies and dressed up in all this like bright colors They like give me a People who drink too much they just want to drink alone sad and like they want to sit at home and drink Are you trying to? I'm just saying I'm just speaking reality here. They just want to drink in the room and pass out editing podcasts Oh Look, yeah, that was amazing That was I think the problem was we drank too fast If people don't know what we're talking about We do a final pass of the podcast and we had Corey come over normally I do it, but Corey came over and we thought it'd be a good idea to you know kick back listen to the podcast make some final edits Have a few drinks During the process let's break that logic down You thought it was a good idea to have a few drinks while doing something that had to be productive Yes, I thought that was a good idea. Yes, despite all evidence Light in the mood never ended well ever look it boiled down to it started off great I thought it was really fun It was very unproductive though because it took forever to make an edit it was already edited Yeah, we kept an amazing answering questions and it was really well edited so there wasn't a whole lot of like make me just go We just listen and make was coming in and editing he's like nice delete it We just kept but then I asked Corey to make drinks for me and I just kept drinking them It's a terrible situation where all you have to do is turn your head to the side and say hey Can I have another one and all of a sudden it just magically appears? Yeah, cuz you're not like you're not pouring it yourself going. Oh my god. Look at the bottle. It's almost done Yeah, somebody else is pouring you the drinks, you know, I apologize in order for me because at the beginning of the stream I said you know these guys are probably gonna once you start drinking I'm like they're not gonna be done for like 14 hours and it actually took probably like 16 hours Yes, so you were wrong. I was wrong. I was dead wrong This this is funny too because when you were editing it there was this part where I was drunk out of my fucking mind I saw the footage I saw the footage I can never go and I was like I was like pushing my face The max things in my face that went over to you and I'm like how tipsy are you and you're like I'm there and then I got cut off Oh, you hit a button so essentially. Yeah, so essentially the for some reason the actual stream just stopped Yeah, but my computer was turned off too. I don't know how it's but you were still editing that day That's the mystery. Nobody knows what happened. I know the truth. What happened because I don't you were editing Literally blacked out during you were editing and around that time. I'm like I was too drunk and I'm like I can't there's no more liquor So I'm like I'm kind of done now you were taking a break You're like I'm gonna go take a piss break and you left and you went back to the stream Yeah, and you flip the audio back like you usually do yeah, and you played it like you were streaming But you weren't streaming. I thought you were still streaming. Yeah, the people were still talking something Oh, it's so streaming so I left and I went downstairs and I sat down with stamper and we watched hewie herman And then he were you fucking guys do And then he ordered pizza just insane amount of pizza and then I had it went back upstairs And you were rolling around on your bed going like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:12.990 --> 0:03:15.994]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:15.994 --> 0:03:16.686]:

  Yes.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:55.228 --> 0:03:58.941]: 
  Yes, despite all evidence in the mood

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:58.941 --> 0:04:00.055]: 
  would make everything better.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:06.332 --> 0:04:09.353]:

I can get through the day now. Jeff, have you ever head butted somebody? Never. Have you ever wanted to? Have you ever resisted the urge to just thrust your head forward? Usually when I do something, usually it's like, there's no like stopgap in between. It's all like, all or nothing. I'll just be like, that person's cool, or I just want them in a river, dead or something. There's just no in between. No. So that's the story behind the untamed story. Yeah. Yeah. The Seabrook and the Lost Hours. People were saying, I rewatched it. People were saying, I was like, me and you were just like plastered. We were drunk, but we were still coherent enough to sit there and be able to press buttons. I heard the opposite. Some people were like, were you drunk? If anybody had to ask, they're clearly not familiar with what people look like drunk. No. When you're drunk, you're like falling over, destroying shit. I thought you were playing up a little bit. So it's Easter. We got off topic before. I wanted to talk about Easter because I feel like I just kind of like, hey, fuck Easter. Yeah. But it's like, you know, Easter has its place in everybody's hearts for whatever it's meaning. It's Jesus rose from the cave. Or they're just like, ran or death.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:20.125 --> 0:07:20.294]:

  Is that what happened? Did he push the bowler and then just fly up into heaven?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:20.250 --> 0:08:28.013]: 
  I've described it the boulder slid forward a teeny bit and Jesus squeezed out of it like a balloon Yeah, way into the wind and his body was

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:24.385 --> 0:08:34.881]: 
  and flow away into the wind. So his body was gone. And that's why everybody closes their store, because Jesus went to heaven that day. Why? Because if they keep the door open, he'll slide right into their store. It was like, Jesus got a...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:31.034 --> 0:08:32.687]: 
  Why did he keep the door open?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:33.328 --> 0:08:45.546]: 
  It was like Jesus got like the shit kicked out of them, right? And then they put them in a cave and they pushed a rock in front of them and they said stay in there! But okay, so it's like you put snakes around it too so you got scared. Yeah, there was slithering slimy serpents

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:51.814 --> 0:09:54.649]: 
  I give him an 8.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:56.573 --> 0:10:07.204]: 
  He got his skin ripped from his butt. Do you not see Malbrook's movie? No. Yeah, see, no. Malbrook's. Mal Gibson. Bro, Malbrook. What about those people? Jesus, musical? What about the...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:59.880 --> 0:10:01.180]: 
  Yeah. See. No.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:02.766 --> 0:10:13.870]: 
  What about those people that are like literally like tied to wheels and have their limbs smashed in with hammers and stuff I think Jesus nailed it

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:11.727 --> 0:10:28.450]: 
  See that's where I think Jesus nailed a little wheel to the back of the cross so he dragged it easier He was a carpenter after all I think they nailed a wheel to each side of the tee. Yes, right? Yeah, so then they nailed Jesus down He was like face flat on it Yeah, they made him walk to the top because they're not gonna walk him to the top Was he like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:28.062 --> 0:10:31.926]: 
  Was he like Axl from Twisted Metal 2? Yeah, he like lay flat down on the cross and he like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:31.926 --> 0:10:38.609]: 
  Bro, damn the matter, that high speed. And he raced those other two guys. Cross racing. Yes, so. What the brats, you do the rock?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:36.465 --> 0:10:45.578]: 
  Yeah, so whatever wins gets put in a cave. So this is how it works back then. You're like, I want to go play the cross-racing. And they're like, yeah, well, for

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:45.578 --> 0:10:49.223]: 
  First need to put on a little show. We're gonna whip you around for a bit. And they're like, okay. You know what?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:48.565 --> 0:11:02.402]: 
  You know what? So disrespectful. Unbelievable. I've never even seen Jesus. This is the five guys' fault. This is why in Ireland the crosses, the crucifixes they have in the church, has Jesus nailed to the cross with the two wheels on both sides.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:52.446 --> 0:10:53.442]: 
  I've never even seen-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:53.442 --> 0:10:54.944]: 
  This is a heat sink, but this is a hot sink.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:54.944 --> 0:10:56.024]: 
  This is why you're not...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:02.369 --> 0:11:07.735]: 
  Everyone has a nail facing outwards. That's bullshit. He needs to have his head arched up looking forward. I heard that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:06.486 --> 0:11:24.542]: 
  I heard that people were actually crucified the opposite way like the one that's represented as hell was the original way everyone was Yeah, like the actual way of doing was you were put where the tall part was up first So it's actually the hell one you were like that So most of the time they just turn you upside down so you die faster

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:12.949 --> 0:11:13.979]: 
  What, upside down?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:18.467 --> 0:11:20.054]: 
  You were put like that. Oh, upside down.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:24.542 --> 0:11:25.960]: 
  You can't run fire.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:25.437 --> 0:11:29.706]: 
  on fire. Your face is, your hair, like your long flowing greasy hair.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:28.457 --> 0:11:31.647]: 
  So when they put the fire near you, your head burns first. Yeah, you can't.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:31.124 --> 0:11:33.570]: 
  Yeah, you catch fire faster.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:33.570 --> 0:11:35.444]: 
  Okay, that makes sense. I'm going to...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:35.444 --> 0:12:30.591]: 
  Cory's reasons. This is why I don't sleep upside down, because I don't want to fucking get caught on fire. That's what happens. That's true. Don't hang from your roof like mellows. I don't think he was a witch, Cory. I don't think they, maybe they did set people on fire. I don't know. No, for him, he was a special case. Did that college pick up their eyes like in the middle? Being hung like that is like, that's like the worst of the worst. So, he died on the cross. How long did they leave him there? Probably, oh, 14, 13 days, something like that. A bunch of days, he brought it away. 12 days. A week, that's what we call it a week. See, this is my problem. This is my problem with it. They put him in a cave, right? They could check back a week later. He's like, he's no longer here. But the problem is they didn't have proper technology to calibrate how long he's actually been in the cave for. He could have been on the cave on fucking Friday or Saturday. They also had the sun. That could have helped. The Romans had no forensic science lab. Exactly. That's very true. What I don't understand is we celebrate Easter as him rising up, but there's no evidence but these guys going up to check up on him. They're like, oh, he's no longer here. Nobody stayed there. So it's like, do you think?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:42.632 --> 0:11:43.240]: 
  Is that a w-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:47.526 --> 0:11:50.277]: 
  No, for him, he was a special case.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:58.512 --> 0:12:00.047]: 
  He brought it away.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:01.178 --> 0:12:02.865]: 
  See, this is my problem.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:04.874 --> 0:12:05.093]: 
  Right?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:06.257 --> 0:12:06.713]: 
  It's like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:13.902 --> 0:12:14.459]: 
  It's...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:14.492 --> 0:12:16.247]: 
  Friday or Saturday.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:19.504 --> 0:12:19.994]: 
  Exact.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:19.994 --> 0:12:21.023]: 
  It's very true.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:28.785 --> 0:12:33.494]: 
  So it's like, do you think? He was like getting a stick from heaven and poking his... Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:32.650 --> 0:13:16.829]: 
  A lot of people out there believe Jesus was being real. They believe it's just a story. A story? There are people that steal bodies for science. So maybe there was a grave robber that stole Jesus' body. For science. For science. Not necessarily. Maybe there are other reasons to steal bodies. You're a smell really bad, I think. Jesus. People followed Jesus and they were like, Don't listen to somebody who took his body. Yes. Somebody could have been hiding behind the mountain, came up, got him. That seems so much more likely. If you put a dummy Jesus there. He's going to just waking up new ideas. If you've got hundreds of followers, why wouldn't they move the boulder? Exactly. 100 people could move a boulder. They were all hiding behind the mountain. They were watching Jesus come up and they were hiding behind the rocks. All hundreds of them waiting for them to go. They left the Benny Hill theme playing while they ran. Do you hear the xylophone when they're towing? Like, I've solved it. Right?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:37.341 --> 0:12:37.662]: 
  There are

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:45.593 --> 0:12:47.939]: 
  There are other reasons to steal bodies.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:47.939 --> 0:12:48.512]: 
  She's...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:50.048 --> 0:12:51.719]: 
  Don't listen to somebody take him by the hand.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:53.625 --> 0:12:54.250]: 
  God seems to be my mother.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:54.942 --> 0:12:56.832]: 
  If you put a dummy Jesus there.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:58.013 --> 0:12:58.637]: 
  If you got

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:01.489 --> 0:13:01.995]: 
  They were

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:01.995 --> 0:13:06.940]: 
  the boulder exactly 100 people can move a boulder they were all hiding behind the mountain they were watching Jesus

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:12.492 --> 0:13:24.068]: 
  Yeah, and you hear like the xylophone when they're titoing? I've solved it, right? Okay, so Mick, as you always say, all those fucking brown-os look the same, right? Uh oh. Anyway, I'm sorry, that's my finger!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:21.672 --> 0:13:26.549]: 
  Anyway, I'm sorry Chris O'Neill anyway

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:25.232 --> 0:13:38.496]: 
  Anyways where I'm going with this is one Brattle goes in the cave crispy brown Oh, they lock him in the cave. They push they pushed a boulder in front of the cave They locked the boulder

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:34.665 --> 0:13:35.492]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:35.492 --> 0:14:04.635]: 
  The boy with the bowie is the key. So what I was thinking is maybe the guy who had the key was like, maybe I could be famous, right? So he unlocks it and he looks around with his shifty eyes, right? And he goes in and he takes off the old Jesus clothes, puts it on him. The same looking man comes out. I'm a resurrected man. And everyone's like, it's Jesus. He's back. Nobody bothered even looking the cave to find the... Yeah, the other guy's still running in there with like rats on his eyes. No, Jesus was gone. Corey, no, it's not saying. It's a false. There wasn't a soul in the cave. What was it? Like, you think he was really handsome? Jesus? No. Handsome? Everyone always draws him like a beautiful...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:44.402 --> 0:13:44.774]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:53.498 --> 0:13:54.426]: 
  Yeah, the other guy's still running.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:54.426 --> 0:13:56.063]: 
  plugging it in there? Rats on Jesus.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:58.274 --> 0:13:58.290]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:01.767 --> 0:14:24.312]: 
  Jesus no handsome. It's always draws him like a beautiful like white dude, but he was definitely just like a normal This is gonna be the new bad word that we invented and it's gonna like lead back to us and we're gonna get it such

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:06.492 --> 0:14:10.457]:

They bring him down like a snake down the mountain They drop him into the Red River. They replace it with a dummy They have a string connected to a giant pole in the sky that they trail the dummy up so it makes it look like he's flying That's where Easter kid was

They would think of Hitler is like a celebrity and so yeah as a celebrity Good guy like clearly a bad guy Yeah Never said any good shit about I never said anything good I'm just saying the way we joke about him. He wouldn't really have a clear picture of what he was right Yeah, I don't think any of us have ever been pro I think if anything it was just a matter of not painting them as the monster do we have to say we're not pro hitler Do you have to pull? No, I'm not saying that I'm not you know what? We're not pro hitler. We're not

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:13.442 --> 0:16:13.679]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:21.306 --> 0:16:21.846]: 
  They would think of him.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:23.601 --> 0:16:25.035]: 
  Yeah, I think they think of him as-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:26.267 --> 0:16:32.950]: 
  Kind of like how we saw Johnny Douglas. Not like a good guy, like clearly a bad guy. Antihero. Yeah, kind of like antihero-esque.

  să поспоримhost killer

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:08.944 --> 0:17:18.664]: 
  Brown nose! Fucking Hitler was a huge loser, the most successful one of all times. Pretty much just was a fucking loser and he just got motivated because of it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:14.935 --> 0:17:15.390]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:18.664 --> 0:17:45.462]: 
  I still never understand how the picture perfect Aryan Nazi was this blonde haired blue-eyed giant when you had Hitler at the front of the band. I don't get it, yeah. Cause he like clearly was the opposite of that. Maybe he was gay. Maybe that's the kind of person he liked. Hitler had one testicle. And he had extreme flatulence all the time. No, this is not a joke. I bet. Not a joke. All that chocolate. I swear. Where did you read this? I heard it. In the same book as your 30,000 foot bronze source. He had an irritable bowel syndrome. I'm not kidding.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:30.612 --> 0:17:31.506]: 
  Maybe that's the kind of

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:35.944 --> 0:17:39.471]: 
  No, this is not a joke. I bet. Not a joke. All that chocolate.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:40.990 --> 0:18:08.462]: 
  In the same book as your 30,000 foot dinosaur. He had um, he had irritable bowel syndrome. I'm not kidding. And then no, this is not in the same dinosaur I said. This is not on the fucking foot dinosaur. 30K dinosaur. And the 50 foot wide crab. I never said that. There is 10 feet crab. And I don't know what I said, but it was 5 feet. And that is true. I saw a fucking crab that could have killed me. In Irish waters. Do you know that there's seals in Wexford that come out on the road and they beg for food? That's believable. It's true.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:44.939 --> 0:17:45.006]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:48.634 --> 0:17:52.954]:

That is a phot- that crab is like 20 feet- it's- it's a- it's not even a king crab, it's one of the regular crabs. Japanese spider crab. You're a Japanese spider crab. Those are the crabs that they ride around on the back. It's like school buses for kids. I saw like a guy like actually legit trying to like, you know, fuck a Japanese spider crab. That would be legit the most disturbing thing ever. Probably. Is that even a real thing? A Japanese spider crab?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:10.825 --> 0:18:12.225]: 
  It's not a Photoshop!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:18.014 --> 0:18:19.347]: 
  Japanese spider crab

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:21.017 --> 0:18:21.287]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:23.582 --> 0:18:23.937]: 
  It's a

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:23.937 --> 0:18:24.730]: 
  Classic full-time score.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:25.995 --> 0:18:27.632]: 
  I'm not like a guy like actually legit

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:32.492 --> 0:18:36.458]: 
  I'm getting a real thing at Japanese. Japanese spider-crapes are like 10 feet long.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:36.070 --> 0:19:30.475]:

Just as long as you remember their legs are long and they're they wrap around you and like bring you closer You know speaking of they don't attract people Chris. They don't attack people What I'm saying is if you're fucking it it will like enjoy it and bring you how how real like recently Chris made me watch a movie called The Angeles ish. I love that movie. It's a good movie. It's got a lot of butts And it's about being Catholic and you only let's I remember our baby but lots of baby but lots of baby But lots of man butts, but one of the things that I remembered was the boys the young boys behind the wall Jerking off to just like they weren't like fucking sheep, but they literally were just looking at a herd of sheep That scene is weird. I think the message they were trying to convey was that four of them all together Along the wall. They're probably looking at their private part. What is it? What is everybody's favorite religious movie? Angela's ashes Angela's ashes

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:37.589 --> 0:18:39.445]: 
  in the mouth.

  Whoa, jerking their chains.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:18.072 --> 0:19:22.493]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:22.493 --> 0:19:24.704]: 
  together along a wall.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:26.222 --> 0:19:26.526]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:29.699 --> 0:19:40.853]: 
  Angel is ashes. It was not a religious movie, but it has a lot of religious. I love that movie It's one of my favorite movies ever. I think it's one of the most rewatchable movies. Oh, there's lots of kid bits I watch it again, and you'll see new stuff. I swear to God. I bet I

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:31.487 --> 0:19:33.394]: 
  But it has a lot of religious

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:36.246 --> 0:19:38.541]: 
  There's lots of tidbits everywhere.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:40.212 --> 0:19:48.919]: 
  I bet I bet I still am curious though. Is that a national pastime in Ireland? Haha, no. Is that like a sign of adolescence? Like you're becoming a man?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:45.156 --> 0:19:45.696]: 
  No.

These people, they're professionals. When the girls do it, they have people holding the fucking horses from behind while they're getting fucked. So, cause they're trying to like keep them restrained so these people aren't getting fucked in like the meadow by themselves. They're not getting their fucking insides blooded by a fucking Beastiality or the Kori. Prophetic Ed.

  Dude, this huge duck in black died right next to the office.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:46.088 --> 0:25:03.098]: 
  You died right next to the office. Malala, let me just break this down. You ever just, like, imagine, like a house or an office and a fucking, a big animal just dies next to it? And you know, that's like, you walk by it several days, and you're just like, what do we do about this? You just keep hoping it's not there the next day. You're like, somebody's gonna take care of it. Somebody moved it, but it never goes anywhere. Get to show up with my friends.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:59.115 --> 0:25:00.584]: 
  Yeah, somebody's gonna take care of it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:01.765 --> 0:25:07.637]: 
  Good to show up with my friend. I tossed it like a football into a river. Did you swing it by its big duck head?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:07.114 --> 0:25:21.525]: 
  And it didn't like hit the water and bob up and down and float away. It just slammed into the riverbed and just sat there. Oh, that's true. But you didn't see what happened after. No, I didn't fucking core it. No, I'm not saying you did. You just missed the aftermath of these like herds of ducks coming over and seeing it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:10.523 --> 0:25:14.050]: 
  slammed into the riverbed and just sat there. It's true.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:15.501 --> 0:25:17.104]: 
  No, I didn't fuck it, Corey. No, no.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:15.518 --> 0:25:16.007]: 
  No, I didn't.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:21.424 --> 0:25:26.588]: 
  Oh, they like fuck dead bodies do they? Yeah, well it tried to it was like I know ducks are fucking great It was like honking and fucking

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:22.994 --> 0:26:29.312]: 
  Yeah, well it tried to it was like it was like honking and fucking like going on it and then it flew away That was the wife duck! It just couldn't do anything so it flew away There's something weird about dead animals that like I haven't dealt with like a deer or anything like that Most of the dead animals I've dealt with have been fairly small But I do feel like they get lighter like you'd think dead weight like I'm sure human bodies very different Well horses are the only exception They get lighter when they die I don't know what it is it like my dog passed away and we had to put it down And I had to carry it from my house to a car where they had a thing to take away Yeah, but I do remember like I had to carry them all the time And I don't know if it's because like their muscles are tensed up So they're like kind of like flailing around or like whatever but after we put them down Maybe it was in the moment. I don't know. Well, you know, I felt lighter. A soul is 10 pounds Is it do people say stuff like that? They say do you say? Because I went hunting as well and when we shoot these we were shooting pheasants and stuff And I remember because they were also a monster. You're a monster. No, you never tell you the first time I went hunting What's a pheasant the pheasant? It's a bird. It's a big it's a good bird

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:50.196 --> 0:25:51.698]: 
  They get lighter when they die.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:59.393 --> 0:26:01.688]: 
  But I do remember like I had to carry them all the time.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:03.494 --> 0:26:03.949]: 
  So

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:03.949 --> 0:26:04.354]: 
  They're like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:08.995 --> 0:26:09.383]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:11.610 --> 0:26:11.948]: 
  Is it?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:13.770 --> 0:26:15.002]: 
  Because I went hunting.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:27.439 --> 0:26:31.641]: 
  It's like a bird that you heard. It's like a peacock mixed with a fucking... Yeah, yeah, it's kind of like a peacock.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:30.224 --> 0:27:32.695]: 
  Yeah, it's kind of like a peacock. It's like an ugly shitty peacock. It is. It's a shittier peacock. And they like bite them to then be hunted, but they only have like a two-year lifespan anyway. Anyways, so we went hunting. It was the first time everyone went hunting. I shot my first pheasant. It was lying on the ground and what you're supposed to do is you grab it by its head and then you spin it around. Like one of those like, like, New Year's crank things, you know what I mean? And you're supposed to break its neck that way and then it flaps a few times more and then it settles down. And then you're supposed to put it in your jacket. When we're out there, it's cold. There's snow everywhere. Mike, Ronnie and Granddad used to do that. Yeah, yeah. So we have these jackets and you actually stuff your birds in your jacket while you're going. So I kill this bird, break its neck, put it on my jacket, you know, whatever. And we kept hunting and then finally we came up to another bird. Dogs were ready to flush it out. And all of a sudden this bird just starts flapping again. Like while it was in my fucking sleeve. And this was like three or four minutes after it was clearly dead from before. And I'm sitting there trying to aim because we're waiting for the second pheasant to fly up from because they were like these cornrows. You're waiting for this bird and this thing in my fucking sleeve just keeps flapping around. So I'm sitting there with my elbow just trying to like jabbing and stopping.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:30.291 --> 0:26:32.451]: 
  Yeah, yeah, it's kind of like a pica. Yeah, it's like an ugly shit.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:33.109 --> 0:26:33.497]: 
  It is.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:33.497 --> 0:26:35.505]: 
  No, he never talks about any

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:59.654 --> 0:26:59.940]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:03.248 --> 0:27:03.501]: 
  So I'll see you guys next time.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:03.501 --> 0:27:03.771]: 
  I kill

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:25.118 --> 0:27:25.287]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:30.974 --> 0:27:33.370]: 
  Jem is stopping us. Stop.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:33.285 --> 0:27:39.175]: 
  It's kept freaking out. I'm not cut out for fucking out dead animals on a honey. I don't like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:37.319 --> 0:27:42.364]: 
  Me neither. Hunting? I don't like hunting. It would make me feel bad personally. I would never shoot.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:40.930 --> 0:30:19.960]: 
  Plus I would never shoot a deer with a gun. What about a bow with a bow? I would guess what yes No, because I I already feel bad if I could I'd actually like to kill it with a dagger I'm gonna shoot at the bow because if you don't hit its vital I then yeah for miles. That's right I mean it like bleeds and then it dies and you don't find it Yeah, it's true. That's the ultimate. I would just feel I guess you could say like with a gun if you got it in the right spot You're gonna kill it quicker You get one of those Guns are just so unfair nature to begin with I kind of like but I had I had a compound bow as a kid Yeah, you're kind of fun to use. Shooting bows is fun. Just not into deer. Yeah. Yeah, that's just me personally I don't I would feel bad. I couldn't even hit it fucking deer if I wanted to but I'm just saying oh, I never have I've never had to stare into their big doughy eyes They're a challenge to use man because it's not like a gun where there's one sight you look for you have the set pins on the thing Yeah for various distances to judge the distance and but even then you have to judge the distance with your eyes sort of Jeff you're a man of many talents How many times have you pointed that bow at somebody didn't like well they did I shot a lot of hay bales make nothing No humans. What's a compound bow? Is that like a when will you unfold it? Like it's like a thing that's like it's a composite or compound It's called a compound bow basically it means there's a pulley system on it where when you pull this normally with the typical But you pulled the string back and it's harder and harder and the group and all the way back It's that you're holding it the hardest you can yeah with a compound bow the way the pulleys work It's hard to pull it first, but then it gets easier at the very end of the pole which makes holding it Yeah, I had that one I actually had a bow was black and it had like pink neon because this is you know the time everything was like neon and it was Like black neon with like I had like green arrows and I had like my own little like thing You have a good target thing you practice on yeah, and I didn't have like a good one So it wasn't it wasn't tough enough to hit any pierce any skin So I was always worried though that I would end up hitting somebody so I stopped using it When you live on like an area and you're like an area like people you don't want to end up hitting somebody with a fucking arrow That's the thing that was weird me out about like guns just in general when you shoot a gun because apparently it goes like a very long distance Yeah, quickly, so I'm always thinking like if you shoot a gun like for all you know like a hundred yards away Right like somebody else happened in my area. There's houses around where I used to grab they get hit by straight bullets Yeah, hunters are idiots. You're wearing bright clothes. They'll still shoot But I'm saying like through the trees and then exactly and then you know for all you know There's somebody on the other side on our property at my dad's place There was always people hunting because we had a wood area and you know You're there's hunting season and if you go hunting beyond hunting season you can get like fine Yeah, so that it doesn't matter But there were like times where people would like becoming and walking around with rifles right outside our area like hunting animals My dad being shot during

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:46.836 --> 0:27:48.490]: 
  Why? Does that work? No.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:52.658 --> 0:27:53.012]: 
  What the fuck?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:56.303 --> 0:27:59.391]: 
  Then yeah, that's right. And then it like bleeds in.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:02.057 --> 0:28:03.795]: 
  That's the ultimate. I would just feel like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:08.183 --> 0:28:09.449]: 
  But if you only guns at your show, I'll kill you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:09.449 --> 0:28:10.984]: 
  unfair nature to begin with.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:13.330 --> 0:28:16.502]: 
  Yeah. They're kind of fun to use. Shooting bows is fun. Just not into deer.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:16.502 --> 0:28:19.304]: 
  Yeah, that's just me personally.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:21.902 --> 0:28:22.847]: 
  Oh, I never have.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:25.092 --> 0:28:26.695]: 
  They're a challenge to use, man.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:31.707 --> 0:28:31.960]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:36.837 --> 0:28:37.174]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:36.591 --> 0:29:37.350]: 
  That's the thing though is we're

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:42.278 --> 0:29:43.105]: 
  very quickly.

They like run off because they're not supposed to be there. They're fucking idiot. There's signs everywhere saying don't hunt here. No hunters allowed. Exactly. They just ignore them. This is just stupid. But I can't read. If I was to like hunt like a deer or something like that, either with like a knife, only because look, I'd want to make it as even steven as possible. I mean, they've got hooves, so technically they could- What about antlers? Would you- Or antlers. You fight a deer with antlers. Just with a pair of antlers? Fucking clobber them with just a pair of antlers. It's only fair. It would be only fair. I would want to rest. I mean, I've had lots of dreams where I'm like chasing a deer down. You hurt. And I can- and I feel everything. Are you so sad to death? I dive- I dive through the air and I actually land on top of it and I wrap my arms around its neck and it's still moving really fast. So it keeps moving and I literally have to throw my weight to the side just to throw it off balance. And then we both hit the ground, slide for a while. At that point it's riddling around, but I'm holding on with dear life and I just bite into its neck. You're like the opposite of-

I heard it was kinda cool. It's cool. It's like an action movie. It's just not even, it's like watching the War of the Rings. It actually makes religion, like people who are like, oh well that's just a fantastical fairy tale, you know, like Jesus is about as real as Frodo or whatever. It essentially makes the Noah story into one of those Frodo stories. Like it's just so ridiculous. It was so stupid, but I did like the one shot where they pull away into space and you just see the earth and it's just one huge storm over the entire place. Oh yeah, that was kinda cool. See my favorite shot was when they pulled out and you just saw fucking Noah's bare ass. He's like literally face planted on the beach and he just has this sandy ass. Russell's whole. A sandy wet ass. Russell Crowe's sandy wet bubble butt. Cause he actually gained a little bit of weight for the role and he's literally, like his dick must be in the sand. Like he's got his wiener, that's fucking whole. I don't know why that was the first thought. Because they do a close up of his fucking ass cheeks. Is his dick okay? Not at least why I didn't understand. Is his dick okay? He was face planted so hard I was concerned about his genitals. Do you remember the movie AI? Yes. So do you remember the part where they like string up all the robots and like talk about how they're gonna torture them? Like in the arena or something? Yeah, in the arena. Like all these like post-apocalyptic people. If they did a retelling of Passion The Christ it'd be just like that. Like he would be strung up, he'd be like this big buff rip guy, they'd be like what should we do to him? Burn him! Like robot arms coming out with lasers to fucking like hard. He's just like does that hurt me? And like light would shine through. And then his rock angels would come in and with giant fucking hammers and just smash the heathens. See they walked around retarded, like they looked like they were retarded, right? The rock monsters they just were stumbling around and their arms were different lengths. The rock monsters what they represent, they represent like was it supposed to be like Paul and John? No they were angels. No there's like the angels like the main ones that like uh. Wait they named the angels? That's too right him man like Paul and Joseph I forget. Like there's like Paul and Joe, Paulie and Joey? Gabriel and Michael. I guess God hated them cause they were all kinds of fucked up. Yeah well they cheated a lot. Did any of you guys see the Ridley Scott movie recently? The story Moses. Oh yeah! Noah?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:05.978 --> 0:40:08.695]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:13.178 --> 0:47:16.780]: 
  I wonder why they listen to this. I don't know. But I do find a lot of the stories in the Bible, like when they're interpreted, like through like movies and stuff to be really fascinating. Like the story of Adam and Eve as told to a movie, how it's like told like the way... Dude, I feel the whole rib thing was a little much. It's even worse than the snake. My mom has this DVD where like Jesus is downstairs on earth. He's like, he's like molding together a human out of clay. So he's like making his body like rubbing his face and then like he kisses it and it comes to life. And then he takes the rib and he puts it into the other clay model and he makes the woman. But the woman, the woman is the one who betrayed God's trust. She's the one who ate the fucking apple. Let's you remember that. And that's why everybody hates women today. Yeah, that's why. I think it was created because... I'm pretty sure what happened was is God made women first, then out of clay. And then took the wiener off of the woman. She still ate the apple. And then made another man out of that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:29.125 --> 0:46:30.120]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:05.327 --> 0:50:12.938]: 
  I'm like, you're fighting game, like yeah. You're smart and you get the Sloan down a bit. Gawes is trying to balance the earthly game. Yeah, he's trying to balance it. He puts on a new Hannibal.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:09.968 --> 0:50:19.941]: 
  He's trying to balance the earth like a game. He puts on a new animal and it's too overpowered. When he dropped bears down, they were shooting fire out of their fucking mouth. And going up the cabbage and just...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:15.975 --> 0:50:17.460]: 
  I heard of their fucking mouth.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:19.941 --> 0:50:35.888]: 
  You think when you make the slot that was like an agile monkey, right? With an old hat. It was like quick on its feet with its little daggers. Yeah, he uses daggers to cut up his foes. I was like, he's overpowered. So he got his finger in his thumb and he squashed his head down and made him slow. He's pretty shooky.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:23.282 --> 0:50:27.400]: 
  It was like quick on its feet with its little daggers.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:29.475 --> 0:50:30.505]: 
  I was like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:30.505 --> 0:50:32.024]: 
  He's overpowered, so he's like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:33.795 --> 0:50:42.689]: 
  I made him slow. He put his shook into the like, Breed Juice came up. See that's like when people try to like, patch something, but they end up fucking it up. He pushed his software update to Earth.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:37.964 --> 0:50:37.997]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:37.997 --> 0:50:42.452]: 
  People try to like patch something, but they don't fucking it up. He pushed a software update to Earth.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:43.752 --> 0:51:58.154]: 
  Oh my god, that's what I had in what makes the slot that we're powered because they seem pretty shitty man They're razor claws. They have like Wolverine claws. That's true But if you could see if that thing like if you could like see it run like a fucking Sloth running around like bullseye and daredevil. That'd be terrifying of Zombies like from 28 days later if you infected slots Yeah, those things would literally be like knife tornado. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, they be spinning around like the Tasmanian Like an evolutionary mystery though, you know, how do they survive anything? I don't know so slow that they just like regain all their energy and I don't eat that much I remember someone told me something where like when their babies are born on their back since they're so slow They have like shit on their back and the babies like not shit But like algae and crap mold and stuff and they the babies just eat that till they grow up and can like start doing that And then they just repeat the process. Yeah, it takes so long to get food They just feed off their parents back back mold. Yeah, and since they don't really like they're like kind of camels like water They'll be like subsisting off your own boogers and earwax. I know how to do that It's a baby camels are also really dumb looking camels. Yeah, cuz they have like huge humps and camels So these are like huge smiles I think they put like also God probably had a horse and he fucking squeezed it with his like fingers So it's like they like these big beautiful

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:43.904 --> 0:50:44.849]: 
  Oh my God.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:44.275 --> 0:50:45.119]: 
  That's what I had to do.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:48.831 --> 0:50:50.333]: 
  They have like Wolverine Clothes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:53.438 --> 0:50:55.800]: 
  You're like, see, I'm running like a fucking mutt like hell.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:58.349 --> 0:50:58.939]: 
  dodging

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:58.939 --> 0:51:00.002]: 
  That's what we're saying.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:06.432 --> 0:51:06.938]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:09.284 --> 0:51:12.996]: 
  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, they be spending a right like the Tasmanian

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:14.886 --> 0:51:14.903]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:14.903 --> 0:51:17.873]: 
  How do they survive anything? I don't know. They're so slow that they just like.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:20.202 --> 0:51:20.455]: 
  I'm

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:25.838 --> 0:51:26.142]: 
  baby

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:33.786 --> 0:51:34.022]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:37.532 --> 0:51:39.119]: 
  Back mold, back crush.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:41.835 --> 0:51:43.050]: 
  There would be like some system

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:44.940 --> 0:51:45.312]: 
  I know.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:48.771 --> 0:51:52.298]: 
  Yeah, cuz they have these like huge humps and squished babies. Yeah, I think they probably...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:58.154 --> 0:52:03.435]: 
  eyelashes on it so we could jerk off to it. Yeah, he like twisted eyebrows.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:59.655 --> 0:53:05.772]: 
  Yeah, he like twisted eyebrows. This is big beauty. Pandas are animals that deserve to be extinct. But they think they're cute, so we keep trying to save them. They're vicious. No, not at all. Well, they can't. They can't. They have the strongest jaw of the bear kingdom. What is the fucking bamboo? Polar bears even stronger. They have the stronger polar bears. Oh, my God. Polar bears just have to crunch through baby seals and shit. These guys got to, you know, they got to eat through bamboo. But they're stupid because they have babies and they just roll over on them and kill them. And they just, they can't keep themselves alive no matter what. It's just a struggle every day. Jesus, that's insane. I'm wondering if it was always like that because clearly they existed for a long time. Yeah. So maybe it's like in captivity. They're stupid and would do that. I don't think so. Have you guys ever seen a marmoset? No, what is a marmoset? I know I've heard that word. It's a little, um, imagine like a little capuchin monkey except now imagine him with a very stout body, really fat looking. And he has Einstein hair coming out the side of his head and a little orange face. This sounds like a ridiculously scary creature. No, no, no, no, right there. So fucking cute, right? Me and Nile and my friend, Caitlin went to the zoo recently and there was these two little marmosets.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:03.435 --> 0:52:03.790]: 
  Is there anything else?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:05.292 --> 0:52:06.119]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:08.987 --> 0:52:09.949]: 
  Well, can we?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:09.949 --> 0:52:12.666]: 
  They can, they can't tell. They have, they have these swarms.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:14.657 --> 0:52:17.037]: 
  I was just like, why do you fucking bam bam boo?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:22.994 --> 0:52:23.955]: 
  but you know they gotta

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:33.507 --> 0:52:33.794]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:35.380 --> 0:52:35.869]: 
  I'm wondering

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:39.227 --> 0:52:39.953]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:44.948 --> 0:52:48.458]: 
  a marmoset? No, what is a marmoset? I've heard that word.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:57.334 --> 0:52:58.397]: 
  This sounds like a real...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:59.511 --> 0:53:00.659]: 
  No, no, no, no.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:05.502 --> 0:53:20.099]: 
  Marmosets behind this little glass thing and I'll put his face up to the glass with oh and then the little marmosets run over and just slap it on the glass I'm trying to get denial. Funny as shit. They're so cute though. I've always wanted a monkey as a pet.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:16.943 --> 0:53:23.895]: 
  Though I've always wanted are they mean key as a think they're mean feel like a pet monkey like in the movies that always seems like such a good idea

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:19.440 --> 0:53:19.997]: 
  as a bed.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:22.900 --> 0:53:34.999]: 
  It seems like a good idea, right? Now imagine that you were literally looking after a hyperactive jumping toddler that can jump up on your throat. That can like pull your head through. That has hyperstroke. That can throw shit at you and... Owning a capuchin would literally just...you're doing nothing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:27.675 --> 0:53:32.434]: 
  Yes, that can climb, yeah, no. That can like pull your head, throw shit at you and...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:34.999 --> 0:54:18.486]: 
  except looking after them all day every day. Who's another alien animal? Flamingos. Yeah, flamingos are weird. There's this flamingo person. I hate flamingos. They like stand on their high legs. If you look at them up close, they're just the weirdest. They have these like dead, their beaks are bizarre too. And like they're so thin. They just look so fragile. Yeah, I want- You really just want to break its leg on your knee and be like, cool. They're almost like weird. Yeah. If they were the color they were, they'd be like Harry Potter creatures that only dead, like if you've seen the dead, you can see them. What's with lawn flamingos? Why did that become a thing? It's probably like a symbol of like- Laziness. No, it's like trying to make your backyard look like a Miami beach. Oh yeah. People want to look grimby, remind of Florida. Yeah, Florida. That's true. Because there's flamingos all over Florida. Epic. Pretty epic. Whoa, epic.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:36.012 --> 0:53:36.450]: 
  All the

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:39.488 --> 0:53:43.572]: 
  Yeah, for me, I hate flamingos. You like stand on their high. Look at them up.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:45.647 --> 0:53:46.491]: 
  They have these like,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:46.491 --> 0:53:49.275]: 
  dead their beaks are bizarre too they're so thin

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:49.900 --> 0:53:50.828]: 
  I want- You-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53 --> 0:53:54.119]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:54.709 --> 0:53:56.937]: 
  Yeah. If they were the color, they were the deal.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:56.937 --> 0:53:57.190]: 
  Like,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:01.004 --> 0:54:01.628]: 
  What's with the long-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:05.205 --> 0:54:05.948]: 
  laziness.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:09.559 --> 0:54:10.943]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:12.512 --> 0:54:14.385]: 
  Yeah, that's true.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:16.410 --> 0:54:17.507]: 
  Pretty epic.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:19.718 --> 0:56:44.438]: 
  Hi, I'm Jeff from Sleepy Cabin, and I have a special message for you today. 93% of Sleepy Cabin fans suffer from severe, debilitating autism. These poor souls substitute real-life relationships with imaginary Sonic the Hedgehog characters. In their minds, they think the Game Grumps are their real-life friends. This disorder ravages lives and embarrasses families everywhere. Please donate today to put an end to these poor, sad bastards writing conspiracy theories on 4chan about eager raptor and jauntron not playing video games together anymore. Because really, how could any well-adjusted human being give a shit about any of this? Please donate what you can to SleepyAutism.org to help an early 20s manchild today. Thank you. I don't know, I guess the original office. You ever see the original office with Ricky Gervais? That was cringe. All that great humor is super cringe. The problem is, now we're getting into the semantics of cringe, because that's fabricated cringe. It's created with actors. It's written cringe. It's not the kind of cringe where people are embarrassing themselves. Do you get the same, so let's say people get satisfaction from watching cringe, clearly, because that's why they watch it, right? So you get the same satisfaction from watching fabricated cringe, like, oh my god, that moment in that movie. They obviously tried to make it cringey. Do you get the same kind of satisfaction from that, than when you watch? I wouldn't call it satisfaction. It's just like a spectrum.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:30.087 --> 0:55:30.947]: 
  subset.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:30.947 --> 0:55:31.521]: 
  I don't want to be in the

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:33.563 --> 0:55:33.867]: 
  you would

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:39.520 --> 0:55:40.617]: 
  Well, it's like failed.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:41.984 --> 0:55:45.055]: 
  And then you leave your friends on Skype. It's changing meaning. It's a buzz.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:47.384 --> 0:55:47.890]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:48.987 --> 0:55:49.949]: 
  And everybody's gonna

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:04.124 --> 0:56:05.119]: 
  Yeah they do.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:07.397 --> 0:56:08.629]: 
  I don't know. I guess the original office

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:09.777 --> 0:56:12.747]: 
  Ricky Gervais? That was cringe.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:12.747 --> 0:56:14.721]: 
  All that British humor is super crazy.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:19.902 --> 0:56:20.070]: 
  Right.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:21.117 --> 0:56:21.488]: 
  It's right.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:21.488 --> 0:56:22.281]: 
  cringe

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:22.281 --> 0:56:22.450]: 
  Movement.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:24.711 --> 0:56:25.589]: 
  Do you get the safety?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:30.364 --> 0:56:30.634]: 
  See ya.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:42.109 --> 0:56:42.413]: 
  I love you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:43.949 --> 0:56:45.552]: 
  like a spectacle it's like whatever the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:45.096 --> 0:57:03.135]: 
  Whatever the appetite that you have that needed to be sated, clearly part of you wanted to experience it, right? So like so- Do you get the same- does that appetite get sated? To be honest, no. I think real, like actual- like we're talking about cringe like it's the high art. It's not- no! Yeah. What I'm saying is- I'm talking about it like it's a crack addiction. Yeah. So don't- don't think of it as high art. No.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:50.547 --> 0:56:50.901]: 
  Like so.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:58.343 --> 0:56:59.676]: 
  What I'm saying is...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:01.600 --> 0:57:01.954]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:02.714 --> 0:57:05.009]: 
  What I'm saying is that when we

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:05.009 --> 0:57:09.497]: 
  I think, Corey, look at cringe videos. We're like... It's a good noise fodder to talk about. It's just, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:08.485 --> 0:57:11.522]: 
  It's just yeah, it's actually good background noise.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:11.235 --> 0:57:49.440]: 
  And it's funny because it's like people are like, oh, you you you make fun of people But it's like maybe back then but nowadays I watch stuff and I'm hoping these people because I love it I find entertainment and then when I watch this stuff and it makes me laugh. I feel joy I can cry emotions. I feel it and I'm like I want more I don't want people coming and being like if I get kill your stuff Okay, yeah, no, I hate ruining everything No, you know right because it's like if there's someone I like and then other people find out about him and start harassing Ironically like trying to give him attention that he wants and it's not the kind of harass where it's like Oh, whether fucking with him so he keeps making videos, but it's like the ironic fucking like oh, you're so funny You're so entertaining now you can't watch anymore because people ruin it. Yeah, so right just move on to the next

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:29.882 --> 0:57:31.452]: 
  Yeah, no, I hate that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:31.452 --> 0:57:31.992]: 
  No, you know.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:31.992 --> 0:57:33.055]:

  Yes, go run it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:49.440 --> 0:58:08.627]: 
  And another point to that I wanted to say was I recently uploaded that second life video, right?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:06.314 --> 1:00:06.938]: 
  He's a kid!

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:06.938 --> 1:00:08.490]: 
  We just let him scream about something.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:11.950 --> 1:00:15.747]: 
  thing almost because everyone like such a powerful

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:14.565 --> 1:00:41.076]: 
  It's such a powerful thing that makes you go like oh god We can scream and look in fucking break it It's also kind of self-reflective. Definitely, yeah, it's like you should have sympathized with what's happening in the video. You support them too and then there's like people who like um There's different kinds of it, right? Yeah, there's different kinds, there's spectrums. You see Chris Chan and you're like this is so fucking mean, but it's so crazy that I can't stop watching it, right? But like you're just watching you're not the guy going out of your way to bullying it, right? There's people who are- And also I'd like to say

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:17.670 --> 1:00:21.501]: 
  I'm pretty sure he's screaming and looking at his fucking break-ears. He's also kind of self-reflecting.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:21.501 --> 1:00:23.003]: 
  Definitely, yeah, you should have simply...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:23.712 --> 1:00:25.045]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:47.168 --> 1:00:53.445]: 
  I'm an asshole. Uploading that second life video wasn't like a nice thing to do. I don't think it was mean-spirited though. Like, I think...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:53.445 --> 1:00:59.672]: 
  He'd see it and like at first he'd be like what the fuck but then he'll see the air in the music and he'll be like that's cool

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:58.407 --> 1:01:33.726]: 
  See the funny part is Chris when he found him he was like oh this is fascinating But then he became infatuated with him because he's like holy I'm not gonna lie dude The fact that he was just like he just made that story up on the spot Yeah, no he makes up stories on the spot and they're always hilarious I almost feel like you could just it would be nice to just have him around be like tell me a story And they just work and just let him just let him talk for a while.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:31.026 --> 1:01:36.629]:
