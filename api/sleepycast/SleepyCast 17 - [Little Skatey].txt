Okay, you know my thoughts on bow ties, motherfucker. I think-I think it's a bit of an interesting discussion. Hold on, hold on! No! Bow ties, historically, are just underneath the powdered wig for the gayest fucking thing that any human being has ever worn. Kirby sex, Mario eats mushrooms to get high. Fuck you, Chloe! It's not-

  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:25.004 --> 0:05:25.459]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:38.504 --> 0:05:47.667]: 
  What do you think about eyes? Yeah, what do you think about eyes? Hard to put on? Cory would you put on your boots? Is it the only reason you don't wear them? Listen, I... Or do you not wear them because you're not a cunt?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:41.102 --> 0:05:41.592]: 
  They're hard to believe.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:42.638 --> 0:05:52.527]: 
  Oh yeah? Is it the only reason you don't wear them? Listen, I... Listen, okay. I wear bow ties because I support my man, Bill Nye. You what? Bill Nye said it's good.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:51.548 --> 0:06:07.680]: 
  I love Bill Nye. Peewee Herman? I love Bill Nye but he looks like a queer. Historically 99 out of 100 molesters wear a bow top. It's true. You can either find the red dot on the website or a bow top.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:52.527 --> 0:05:54.484]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:16.152 --> 0:06:19.459]: 
  Fucking a kid in public

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:17.670 --> 0:06:24.792]: 
  I was like, hold on, hold on, hold on, Corey. I think if I saw a guy from the police here, he's gonna come in. You know, he's good in public. Sometimes they just wear the bowtie to lure the child in.

  Wat heb je gedaan? Wat een route!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:33.499 --> 0:15:52.500]: 
  I swear, it was so coffee. Running once like to you? No one else saw that, but Corey said, what are you doing running around and then like squirmed around like a snake moving through water? That's a ju- How else are you gonna suck a midget's wiener? Lyle! I never thought about it. I really haven't. Zach says.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:52.500 --> 0:15:59.402]: 
  It's the only way for Zach to actually have my great angels. He needs a fraternal twin. So he has to be my fraternal twin

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:58.322 --> 0:16:01.967]: 
  You guys look nothing like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:01.934 --> 0:16:08.498]: 
  Twins, share guardian angels, it's been proven. God wrote it in the book. Book book.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:08.498 --> 0:16:31.920]: 
  the cookbook. The one-stirrer kind of Jesus cookbook. Are you talking about the bibbibble? Yes. Lyle. If you saw little Skeedy, he made a best to you. Instead of crying, would you let him cry in your shoulder? Would you fucking kick him across the room? He'd kill him. I would fucking take him to Cory and be like, What did you do to me? Fix this!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:10.624 --> 0:16:11.451]: 
  Let's do it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:13.105 --> 0:16:15.737]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:26.588 --> 0:16:26.959]: 
  I would say

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:32.595 --> 0:16:34.553]: 
  Why do I see this?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:35.245 --> 0:16:39.345]: 
  What about little old Skady? How do you think he feels? Cory, where'd you fucking withdraw, Horty? Skady?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:36.494 --> 0:16:44.594]: 
  How do you think he feels? If you fucking with your horny? Skatey? If you were fucking, you stood in skating circles going, run your wheel and giggle, what would you do? Dude, he's always giggling. You know what I'm saying?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:42.990 --> 0:16:46.450]: 
  Dude, he's always giggling. It's not that giggle you think where it's like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:46.450 --> 0:16:50.500]: 
  That's like a ball to him. That's like a patee game.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:47.580 --> 0:16:52.086]: 
  It's like a bubble. It's like a tea cake. It's like, that's a fucking pet dude. Yeah, it's it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:49.943 --> 0:16:57.857]: 
  Yeah, it's it. Yeah, let's take a little mischievous elf giggling. Yeah, but would you fuck him Corey?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:57.435 --> 0:17:01.064]: 
  Listen. If you could, would you? Honestly, if you were a wig.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:59.967 --> 0:17:02.262]: 
  If you were a wig, if you could fuck this one.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:02.262 --> 0:17:08.016]: 
  When you die, your ass leaves your body. You don't have an ass to get fucked. Wait. You have to go to hell to get fucked.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:08.016 --> 0:17:27.912]: 
  Do you think ghosts have no buttholes? Yes. Ghosts have buttholes, Corey. Would they have ass cheeks still? Ghosts are ectoplasm that floats around and goes through ceilings. In what ceilings? Ghost ceilings. Ghost ceilings. Glass ceilings, they get better jobs. Corey. What you stand? The fuck.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:09.990 --> 0:17:11.948]: 
  Yes. Go ahead, butthole story.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:20.435 --> 0:17:22.140]: 
  I'll tell you that these rules will be...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:27.912 --> 0:17:37.429]: 
  Listen, okay, this is what my pastor told me. He told me, when you die, you go to heaven and you lose your anus so you cannot be raped by straight. Is that why he raped you?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:34.712 --> 0:17:35.134]: 
  So you can kill them.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:36.180 --> 0:17:40.450]: 
  Is that why he raped you the real life so he gets it all out? But you cannot get raped by straight angels.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:40.450 --> 0:17:51.351]: 
  The only way you can get raped is if you go to H double hockey sticks and then you get fucked because it gives you back your anus and gives you all your sins. And all the angels can scarily rape you?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:47.689 --> 0:17:54.439]: 
  And all the angels can you really rape you your body sense if you give you extra buttholes all of your body. Yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:54.102 --> 0:17:55.502]: 
  Yeah, sometimes they make mistakes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:55.502 --> 0:18:03.147]: 
  Every one of your pores becomes a butthole. Think about that. Every pore on your face is a potential butthole.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:56.380 --> 0:17:56.751]: 
  Bye everyone.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:02.522 --> 0:18:05.526]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:08.496 --> 0:18:39.732]: 
  Why would you know these skitties asshole, Corey? When you first see it, what else are you gonna do? Just look at it and don't take a picture. Not from its asshole, it's a little baby midget, Corey. It's a little baby. It's not, it's a midget. It's a little baby. It's a midget, it's a 35 year old man. The giggles.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:13.204 --> 0:18:14.858]: 
  Don't, don't be too asshole.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:18.030 --> 0:18:21.996]: 
  But it's a midget. It's a midget. It's a 35-row man. The Giggle.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:38.787 --> 0:18:41.858]: 
  How mad would you be, boy? Oh my god, I would f-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:41.858 --> 0:18:48.017]: 
  I'm just gonna be like, can you tell him this to me? And fuck him. I'm sorry. I'm all the room. You pull it so tight it's like, came off.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:48.017 --> 0:18:53.704]: 
  That storybook of the guy who pulls the rope and the bitches head fall off That's what I fucking do to Skadyum in real life

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:53.181 --> 0:18:54.902]: 
  If you took a skatesball, always they'd be...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:54.902 --> 0:18:59.442]: 
  He has this little bookie right there. They're well into his feet. Yeah.

  He has this little bookie right there on his feet. Yeah. He's a ghost, dummy. He has nails. He never used fucking feet to the... Everyone knows that when you die, everything you're wearing gets welded to your body. Yes. Fuses with you. Yes. So if you die in a gorilla costume, do you become a gorilla? The little skater was running down his hill with his dog at his least. The dog ran too fast. He went too fast into an oncoming other dog.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:04.673 --> 0:19:05.939]: 
  Yes. Fuse is with you. Yes.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:08.959 --> 0:19:09.938]:

  Run it down his hill.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19 --> 0:19:26.374]: 
  The fucking sherry impact, it's exploding half his body. And that's why little Skady has a dog attached to his body. A dog traffic is really dangerous.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:21.497 --> 0:19:21.936]: 
  That's why love is important.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:21.936 --> 0:19:22.459]: 
  I'm scared of you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:23.843 --> 0:19:25.007]: 
  Dog traffic is

I don't know why all these fucking stories of weird people They're always in a full suit and tie, but he was so anyway He comes as he's working. He's at my house. He's like suit. Yeah, he was a black suit or a white suit It was a black suit with a red tie like the Verizon colors. That's pretty cool. Anyway Yeah, he's like a fucking like agent Smith of Verizon, but he's also a prince anyway I was I was less than hospitable to my regal guests because my house was super fucking messy because all I do is like Roll around in my old filth and jack off So um, I was like, I don't want to let him in my dog was kind of angry at him because he was you know so anyway He was like out outside like filling out all this fucking paperwork and For some reason there was like some bullshit with my plan Let me just sidetrack and say isn't it fucking garbage that any place you go if the computer is not working It is the fucking end of the world. Yeah, it's like. Oh, I'm completely useless now I did a thing and the computer didn't do a thing. Everything is gone to shit. Yeah, so anyway that happened so so Prince Benjamin to give me my new plan had to literally call Verizon and sit through their shitty customer service. He had to

  So he had to go through the thing. I didn't have King Verizon on speed dial. He had to do it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:52.491 --> 0:27:45.942]: 
  He had to do it. He should have, right? He's a prince. Yeah. But, I mean even as just a regular Verizon employee without like regal status, he should have been able to do it. But anyway, so he was, it was like almost kinda raining, not quite raining, but like shitty weather, like it's going to rain. And uh, so I, he was just like, oh you can go inside until I figure this out. So I was like, alright. So I just like went inside and Prince Benjamin just stood outside fucking dealing with Verizon technical support for like, three and a half hours. Did you get him something to drink? It was like, no. It could rain. It was literally, I had to get it rain. It did actually start raining by the end of it. He built it. But yeah, it was like, it was like to this weird point where like, I had to go do stuff and I was like held hostage because there was this African Prince outside my door fucking talking to technical service trying to get me like a better internet package. Well. It worked out, I guess. Did you get it? Yeah, I did. Sweet dude. I did away. Did his eyes about stay. My internet is real. If my internet is real and this is still happening, we have so much fucking shit to go over. How did we meet, Zach? Tell me right now. How did we meet? I don't know. Wait, no it was through, wait, I think it was through the corn. Prince Benji. It was the corn. Maybe the hookup. Listen, this one actually happened. Shut up, you didn't get the joke. Never mind. Never mind. I threw something your way, you dropped it. What was it? What did I miss? Come on, give me a little chance, finally give me a shot. I said that my internet wasn't real and then I asked you how we met. Oh, we met because you were fucking mad and I said you're gay at the end. And I said that's homosexual, you're gonna go to hell. You know what, Zach, you dropped the ball and it fumbled and you were on it. At least I picked it up. I picked it up and threw it 100 yards. Nah, you kind of picked it up and like slipped on yourself and the ball went up your ass. And then everyone else had to pull it out and you ruined everyone's day. At least the ball's covered in pieces. If you threw me the ball, I'd like to fumble it and drop it as well.

Is that still going on? I know. Yeah, every time I go to fast food places, I get a gluten-free or whatever. My cousins jumped on the bandwagon for that like four years ago, right when it started. Your cousins are joining a goddamn cult. They are. It's true. My uncle, this is Alex Jones. He's fucking... Yes. Why? I don't know. He used to listen to Gluton back, but now he hates Gluton back because Alex Jones hates Gluton back. So he switched all of them. Why didn't Gluton back say something? His fucking gluten people are gonna come in with their flat bread and they're gonna try to take over the world and it's not gonna work because they're gonna be malnourished and they're all gonna flop over dead. Dude, you'll never see that thing with gluten-free.

  I can't hit a home run every time isn't it? I wasn't on the water people podcast because my ass was spritin blood But why is it isn't the theory you came downstairs? Yeah, I came upstairs You're gonna get spritling and spritling blood. I walked on you guys. I looked at a snail chow What am I? But isn't the theory that the fluoride is what's in the water? That's what's making people return. Is that the theory of fluoride? See I never I never heard it confirmed by anyone else, but that's what I've said. I put fluoride in the water

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:27.059 --> 0:36:27.480]: 
  and walk to the

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:29.995 --> 0:36:30.704]:

  See, I never...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:38.618 --> 0:36:47.022]: 
  But that's a core, I've said. But I've put fluoride in the air. But it's also two things. It's fluoride and it's a thing called D2, which is a synthetic weed, which is a

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:47.022 --> 0:37:01.450]: 
  Which is really bad to inhale and it actually like makes you stupider.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:54.683 --> 0:36:56.944]: 
  Yeah, there aren't actually methods.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:56.944 --> 0:36:58.497]: 
  They're slaving the water.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:01.450 --> 0:37:03.947]: 
  The water did it first and it couldn't do it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:03.171 --> 0:37:09.499]: 
  I think these guys were like Stephen Hawking geniuses before they were under They were like people who were like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:18.359 --> 0:37:45.224]: 
  They had these little frogs, they had their mouths up like that. They took the rainwater. So anyway. That's what they taught us! That made me think of something. A hypothetical scenario. Hypothetical. Or rather, just something interesting to think about. Give me a hypothetical. We just did Magfest, right? Naturally, when you meet fans, you're gonna have one or two awkward encounters with fans. Oh!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:28.045 --> 0:37:28.568]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:47.755 --> 0:39:30.456]: 
  Yeah, yeah, well anyway, here's a hypothetical scenario that I thought of And I just want to I just want to suggest it to all of you and then react to it how you will what you do if you got cornered by like a Giant like mentally disabled person they didn't talk and all they did was like squawk at you Could you give me like a squawking sample?

No, there's you haven't gotten to it. Yeah, I've got to do it I mean, how would you worry? How would you respond if after this interaction? there was like a 15 paragraph Particularly written tumblr post about how much of a dickhead you are because you were rude to them that happened to me Did that actually not not not? I was like I was like talking to a girl a breakfast I'm still friends with her to this day But I guess her friend like got pissed off of me like because at the time I was hitting on her about it three years later Still friends, but she wrote a huge tumblr post about how much of a content was speaking of actual people who are made I would I would would you do Corey if that happens?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:22.652 --> 0:38:23.361]: 
  Eventually

Their anal glands let loose and they just cake the elevator in it. They smash in the walls and run away. What would you do if they did that and then they got off the floor before yours and then the next floor you went up and then the elevator opened up and there was just like a crying custodian staring at you. And he was just like why would you do this to me? And you were like there were two cat people having a purr fight. Exactly. He wouldn't believe you.

He writes a Tumblr post about how I didn't clean up and do his job and he calls me a fucking ableist He doesn't want you to clean up for him. He doesn't want you to shit in his elevator. Cory, why did you shit everyone? It's not an unreasonable request. It wasn't me! It wasn't me! You can't believe it! Speaking of like shitting and ruining something. It was the kids murr fighting, the adults murr fighting. We knew Guy at Mathvest who told me he was sitting down somewhere and ten guys at the bar in suits came over and started singing Smash Mouth around you. They like encircled and started singing Smash Mouth. Dude, how in the nightmare is that? That is like Josh Shark beat. It was all like, somebody once told me the world was gone too runny. I would be terrified. You're in the shed. You will be under dumb with the beat. But I heard something. I'm like picturing the horrifying scenario right now. That sounds awful. He fucking ran. He ran. Anyone would have. I would bail. Speaking of though, shitting on things and ruining something. A certain one of my friends, I'm not going to name names, was Tom. Anyway, he fucking came to my hotel room and my friend had just gotten out of the bathroom and he had to go to the bathroom. My friend comes out of the bathroom and he goes, he goes, man, you might not want to go in there. It smells terrible. And Tom goes, it's going to be even worse when I'm done with it. He goes into the fucking bathroom.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:06.085 --> 0:43:11.046]: 
  That's not an unreasonable request. It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:12.700 --> 0:43:13.375]: 
  It was a- It was a-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:22.909 --> 0:43:23.601]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:28.418 --> 0:45:11.027]: 
  It's not Tom Fulp, other Tom. Tom Fulp. No, it's Tom Fulp. Anyway. He goes in the bathroom and comes out. Next time I go to use it, the fucking toilet is horribly clogged. And now I have yet to confront him about it, but I'm wondering if he legitimately did that for the sake of the joke? Or if it was just like he was giving us a fair warning. I don't know if it was better or worse that he told us he was gonna do it like before then. Like was that pre-meditation? I've never clogged like pre-meditation. Was it like pre-meditation or was it like heads up guys? Should I be grateful that he warned us or should I be angry? How do you joke? Here's what I don't understand.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:30.342 --> 0:44:30.949]: 
  Anyway

  There were so many people who tried to imitate that exact

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:29.170 --> 1:02:01.890]: 
  I will say Machinima is basically like artistically it's on like the same level as like a puppet show, right? Yeah, so like it can be entertaining, but the second you try to make it like super dramatic It's like you got a really question what you're actually doing with your life There was actually do there was actually like a community of like machinima elitists that like remember Yeah, they would they would make these machinimas That would be like they would be like text about like a guy finding God over like sad music and like halo footage

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:35.970 --> 1:01:36.578]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:44.644 --> 1:01:46.028]:

  And it's just like, it's the fucking Spartan soldiers running on like, Van Halen's.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:04.084 --> 1:03:15.617]: 
  There was one I remember where it was like it was like in Halo 1 like ten years after Halo 1 came out And all it was was like it was like the empty First level of Halo 1 and it was just a bunch of shots of like Master Chief like walking through hallways And it was like supposed to be an homage to 2001 space Odyssey It's like these people were like all like super pretentious and like super like shit talky like anything that was comedy They're like this is such low-class This is my this is my Halo machinima series there was a Halo machinima series It tried to take itself so seriously and I shit you not it was about it was like 50,000 years in the future and an evil regime called Neo Canada. This is not a joke Legitimately what it was called Neo Canada tried to like yeah They were trying to like enforce like a militaristic regime and every episode was like 35 minutes long And they only made it to like episode two Naturally means that know this guy who gives a shit like all the time He makes like all this like art like arty videos are like black and white.

Yeah, no like he get like he goes out of like there's so many of these people who go Other way to say like how like low class you are and then you check out their shit, and it's always the same It's always black and white like crap There's a guy at every kind of field where it's like animations like dude. It's animation But there's this like class people like you do comedy. Oh look at you and you click their videos It's like a blue or black and white thing of a guy with old lady in New York where the feet She dies It's got like that scratchy animation style Yeah, it's animated like on sixes and it's like the last shot is her like fucking turning into a blob in the distance Yeah, the leaves blow and it's like fucking shaped weaning into the sky Get that Calo it's all which is fine.

  Yeah, it does.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:09.145 --> 1:04:31.403]: 
  But it's like, what pisses me off is if you clearly make a video that is something and it's just like, listen, okay, my sense of humor has been refined over the years. I watch Broadway, I watch, you know, I watch like these arts films. I know about direction. It's like in you, you don't understand directing. I think the difference is like... And they direct you to like all these resources.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:27.859 --> 1:04:28.956]: 
  I think the difference is like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:30.357 --> 1:04:38.794]: 
  I mean it's one thing if you're doing it in film or even even I guess technically animation I guess you go to a video with somebody like could if some

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:36.212 --> 1:04:50.978]: 
  If you go to a video with somebody like, if somebody's, the punchline is guess what they fart and then they're like listen okay I feel affected that you haven't Like combed your comedy skills

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:47.181 --> 1:05:05.828]: 
  I'm just saying specifically in the medium of puppet shows in Halo If you want to be a pretentious person in the realm of puppet shows in Halo And you think your puppet shows in Halo are the deepest finest art that's gonna get you into like a Hollywood studio

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:50.978 --> 1:04:51.737]: 
  specifically

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:04.242 --> 1:05:11.447]: 
  Hollywood studio what if he walks into the Hollywood studio headquarters with his fucking laptop in hand slams on the desk

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:11.447 --> 1:05:34.549]: 
  and he's like, Dr. Hollywood, president of Hollywood? I'd like myself a movie. Dr. Hollywood says one movie coming right up. Only for the fight. And then Roger Ebert rises from the grave to give it his final two thumbs up because he made a serious thing about Halo. It's all coming together.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:34.482 --> 1:05:37.030]: 
  Have you seen like previews of it?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:36.355 --> 1:05:47.543]: 
  I don't know if any of them are still around. I'm like more of a curious now. I think a lot of them like graduated from college in film and finally got their McDonald's job. Cause I can appreciate it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:38.481 --> 1:05:39.713]: 
  CDC

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:40.455 --> 1:05:43.459]: 
  I think a lot of them like graduated from college.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:45.079 --> 1:06:08.451]: 
  I can appreciate arts films and I can appreciate that kind of stuff, but I hate when people are like Oh, it's a new style. So it's pretentious or it's trying something It's pretentious if the person let that made it was like, you know, they wanted it to be pretentious You could just tell the director. Yeah, you can tell if it's a pretentious movie. Yeah, like um, I don't know if you saw the movie

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:01.414 --> 1:06:03.625]:

  about it but I haven't seen it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:22.289 --> 1:06:25.444]: 
  It's like it wouldn't work any other way if you look at the way that

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:25.444 --> 1:06:59.498]: 
  style is, it's theater, it's very movie, it's very fucking actiony, the people have to like be moving and the fucking sound is like drums and shit, but that's the like get you pumped like he's like man, I wonder what's gonna happen next and it fucking works. It's really well-directed and people like it's a potential star film. So it's not, it really isn't, it was good. You know what is fucking like pretentious, is when you see like a tear going down someone's eyes and it turns into a fucking black water and then someone falls into the black water and then you find out it was a fucking metaphor for taking a shit. That is pretentious.

  I agree with that. That's fair.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:56.665 --> 1:14:21.100]: 
  There's this kind of quality out here where shit's always like kind of far away Like even in your cities, shit's always generally like super far away Well, if it is, we don't live directly in Philadelphia City though Oh, that's a little bit true But I mean, I don't live directly in LA either And there's three 7-elevens within walking distance for me, for example What?

  Oh, that, that.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:14.130 --> 1:14:14.738]: 
  It's true.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:18.670 --> 1:14:32.963]: 
  You don't even notice that LA is like the huge abundance of fucking like what's that one like nut that they put in fucking everything? Nuts? I don't know. It's not a nut. It's like a it's like I think it's a fruit or type of like nut.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:14:27.546 --> 1:14:28.930]: 
  Not? I don't really know.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:32.963 --> 1:14:44.269]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:36.186 --> 1:14:40.945]: 
  They're in everything. They're in everything. We grow them in California and we're like, we're like...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:40.945 --> 1:14:41.012]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:42.700 --> 1:14:44.995]: 
  Tofu to me

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:44.995 --> 1:15:01.347]: 
  They just don't have a flavor everybody like avocados and fucking in and out are two things that Californians always go Oh, you know, I hate in and out like in and out dude in and out has a secret menu I don't give a shit last time we were at in and it was cold dude. Okay guys

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:51.053 --> 1:14:52.960]: 
  Oh, you know what? In and out.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:59.490 --> 1:15:05.363]: 
  It was cold dude. I had a dang old monster murder. I'm with you. I had a slice

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:02.528 --> 1:15:48.192]: 
  I was waiting for you, I had it! There are slices of roast beef that are thicker than In-N-Out burgers. Four are people who are in Europe or places, or people in the US who don't know what In-N-Out is. I like In-N-Out! In-N-Out is a shitty fucking traffic choke point of a restaurant. It is that. With a cultish following of idiot hipsters that fucking go there. It's good! And they're like, oh, I don't know, it's so good. They pay like eight dollars for a hamburger that's, okay, you know your McDonald's like standard hamburger? Imagine that, but about like half as thick. And that's an In-N-Out hamburger. They'll put a vertical slice of onion twice the size of your fucking hamburger on the burger. And then they put like some dressing on it, and it's like, it's fucking hamburger.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:15:08.046 --> 1:15:08.299]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:15:12.349 --> 1:15:15.269]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:24.752 --> 1:15:25.461]: 
  And they're like, oh.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:34.962 --> 1:15:36.953]: 
  And that's an in and out hamburger.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:42.488 --> 1:15:44.007]: 
  The point of eating that burger.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:44.007 --> 1:15:44.479]: 
  Burner

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:47.382 --> 1:15:54.570]: 
  Wow, the point of an In-N-Out burger is there's a bunch of- Is to not fucking taste the burger? There's a bunch of hidden fucking things on the menu!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:49.997 --> 1:15:52.545]: 
  Is to not fucking taste the burger?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:54.554 --> 1:15:58.097]: 
  Oh yeah, you can get it animal style, you can get fucking... There's like a...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:57.912 --> 1:16:00.308]: 
  It's like a hundred fucking things!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:59.093 --> 1:16:35.526]: 
  Yeah, the also the point. Yeah, the point of in and out is to go there and order shit that isn't on the menu because everything on the menu Is crack? What's so it is? It's a tourist attraction. Yeah, you're like it is. It's a tourist attraction. It's a tourist attraction, but California's don't get over it. It's coming here. I'm so sorry for you. It's awful. It's shitty. It's good. I have one like next to my house So on a day-to-day basis anytime I get in the car that fucking in and out adds like 10 minutes to my trip Just because anytime I have to drive past to get to the freeway. I think this you think I'm jaded. No No, you're saying you think I'm

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:06.569 --> 1:16:08.003]: 
  Crap!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:09.015 --> 1:16:12.660]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:16.761 --> 1:16:18.870]: 
  I'm so sorry for you. It's awful.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:30.143 --> 1:16:31.442]: 
  to get to the freeway.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:34.379 --> 1:16:41.449]: 
  I feel like this opinion more derives from the fact that in and out causes traffic jams within a block of your house

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:41.449 --> 1:16:55.793]: 
  So exactly what I said your biases. Yeah, okay. Well, maybe I Know in and out

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:42.529 --> 1:16:44.453]: 
  Exactly what I said. Say your biases.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:45.094 --> 1:16:48.452]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:54.494 --> 1:17:00.940]: 
  So Burger John? Yeah, they've all recommended it. They've all grew up with a guy who was from California. He said that was the best place ever.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:00.096 --> 1:17:24.480]: 
  When I had it out for the first time, I was underwhelmed. It wasn't bad, it's not, I wouldn't go so far as to say it's bad. I wouldn't say it's amazing. But I haven't had, I- I still think Wendy's is the best- They're fucking, they're fucking French fries are like cafeteria tater tot like squiggly fries. I thought, I thought A&L was great, but I only ate it like a few times. I think Sonic has the best fries. I've, I've been there three times. I've been there three times.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:00.940 --> 1:17:01.632]:

  I've, I've...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17 --> 1:17:26.354]: 
  I've been there three times. I've been there several times. McDonald's has the best fries.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:26.354 --> 1:17:44.950]: 
  I don't give a fuck what anyone says. I actually will contend that McDonald's has a really good price. McDonald's fries? McDonald's can show a two dollar meeting. You guys don't have like Carl's Junior out here, right? No, that's Hardy. Hardy. Hardy. Is it called Hardy's out here? Yeah, we have a Hardy in your house. But is it, you don't have one?
