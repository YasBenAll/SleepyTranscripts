Like whenever he sees a gopher hole, he just fucking throws smoke bombs at him and kills him. But he also used to take his, when he was a little bit more like 10 years ago, he used to take his gun and shoot fucking squirrels from the trees as a back yard. But what he does now is he sets squirrel traps everywhere in his back yard, and he gets myself or maybe not one of my younger cousins to just drop in the pool of water and make them drown.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:06:51.893 --> 0:06:56.027]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:34.671 --> 0:07:34.941]: 
  Google.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:39.497 --> 0:08:00.962]: 
  You take, you lotion, basically you put a cloth over your dick or take a shower and you take your hand like this and squeeze your cock for base to tip open like 30 minutes. Yeah. And there's usually guys with like big bupkos and huge cock so, oh you're gonna be like whoa dude! I'm not gonna do that like this! Everyone does it for like two days like that's too much. I'm not a small dick to talk about.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:54.820 --> 0:07:57.452]: 
  I don't like this.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:07:58.735 --> 0:08:22.950]: 
  I'm not a small dick in the house. I think it's the same as jacking off, really. You're kind of pulling, so I'm just jacking off my dick. I always joke before I do what it was, though. It's specifically for pleasure. No, it makes your dick bigger. It's stretching your dick. They say your dick is made of these spongy stuff. Like, yeah. What do you do with this kind of stuff? Yeah, so you're kind of breaking up the sponges, it stretches it, and then it fills in.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:04.034 --> 0:08:05.772]: 
  I wish y'all could be funny what it was.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:05.502 --> 0:08:10.716]:

  And which it is, Clayton.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:22.596 --> 0:08:29.464]: 
  It's the same thing as working out your app through a nice app. Where it builds down, it comes back to you. It doesn't work, yo. Yeah, you guys had no idea about this. This is really cute.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:23.929 --> 0:08:25.853]: 
  time in person.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:08:28.452 --> 0:08:38.712]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:08:41.073 --> 0:09:00.447]: 
  No, they're not. Come on, that's so good. Every bite, every bite. That's so good. There's muscles or whatever, it's different for girls obviously. There's no equivalent to julking I guess. But when you go pee, you stop midstream and you hold it for a little bit and then you continue peeing. You know, that's supposed to strengthen. Tighten it up. I can just switch my teeth. You're a queef.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:41.412 --> 0:08:42.001]:

You're just concentrating on what you're doing, you're kind of worried about if people are looking at you or not, and you're just like... That just sounds like you're very socially awkward. A lot of people are in Seattle. Oh, really? I feel very out of place. Like here, I feel like I'm at...

Very, how was it like a big museum? It's smallish, but it's still really cool. Every single piece is like some weird historic, almost like I've seen, like for one, do you remember the colon? No. That was like the size of a sleeping bag? Yeah, yeah. Sorry. It was a human colon that they had preserved somehow. It was like a fucking giant skeleton. It looked like there were kids stuffed in it or something. I think that was just like. That is weird because I went like thrifting the other day in the Philly city. I was going through some trip stores. They're all normal. I was like, yeah, there's a bullshit junk I don't want. And then I went in one of them and it was just normal. And then in the back room they had like, like jars with heads, like future trauma in them and shit and like fucking fetuses that are attached to each other. Cool. I'm like, yeah, and like little pig heads and stuff. I was like, there was a kid in the Motor Museum who is like a corpse of a kid whose muscles turned to stone.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:39.469 --> 0:28:39.992]: 
  You know.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:39.992 --> 0:28:41.747]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:52.277 --> 0:28:54.252]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:37.587 --> 0:29:45.450]: 
  Oh, but who got this disease? It's like when you get bruised or something, right? When you get bruised, it turns to rocks. Did you hear about that? Did you hear about that kid? Not that little rock.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:29:42.885 --> 0:30:01.549]: 
  Did you hear about that kid who died in the 1920s? I think she was five and her dad was so devastated. He wanted to be preserved forever, so she's still preserved, but her eyes still open. Yes, I've heard about that. Isn't it like South America? I don't know, but at one point in every day her eyes open and then close again. Yeah, I've heard about it. It's creepy.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:56.301 --> 0:29:57.060]: 
  I don't know, but it is...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:00.469 --> 0:30:02.899]: 
  It's far. It's probably some kind of stick and fucking.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:30:02.899 --> 0:30:18.593]: 
  No, I think it's like something to do with like our muscles There's no way I heard a lot of different stories about like corpses being like super preserved or something Were you guys able to frozen critically? You would Zach, Zach, Zach talked about this This brings me up the wrong way

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:05.397 --> 0:30:06.443]: 
  It's breaking right here.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:06.443 --> 0:30:07.439]: 
  the way as well.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:07.439 --> 0:30:08.822]: 
  I heard a little... I heard a little...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:08.822 --> 0:30:09.717]: 
  I don't know a lot of different stories.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:13.952 --> 0:30:23.655]: 
  frozen cryo- You would Zach, Zach, me and Zach talked about this. Bring me up the wrong way. Cryo- People actually get frozen, this is a real thing. But the way they do it is like-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:24.449 --> 0:31:49.937]: 
  Basically you sign up for this thing when you die of like cancer. There's a couple of us The biggest problem is first if you're in a different state like there's only a couple facilities in the US So if I died here in Pennsylvania, they'd have to come out I'd be dead for like a day or two before they can't do it What they do is like if you live in the area say you live right next to the place I watched a documentary this lady died they pulled her over immediately iced her body down Started pumping her Chest again to keep her blood flowing. Mm-hmm. We started giving her chemicals so she could Mortis so she does so she doesn't actually start writing so her brain Her brain doesn't die basically. Yeah, it's so it but it's dead. It's not dying. Yeah Then they do that put her nice get a body low take her blood out then put some kind of basically Anti-freeze and do it or bloodstream. Yeah, so that's gonna help That's it. No, it's the biggest issue is if you get frozen like a lake or whatever Yeah, the biggest thing you can swipe her a little bit let frozen like you fall cold water But the biggest issue is if you could frozen ice crystals form before you in between yourselves and expand So even if you froze and woke up you'd be fucking like what should be liquid That's what I'm saying like what I'm saying the biggest issue is they die and they freeze you and the freezing process keeps you completely alive Like it so it keeps you preserved. Yeah, we your attack But the issue is when they wake up you're fucking dead. You still have a brain tumor You're still or no, even if they can cure that the future. You're still dead Mm-hmm. The only way to get frozen is if they if they could do it alive. Hmm. I was like slow by process

 SPEAKER_04 [0:30:52.630 --> 0:30:55.127]: 
  So she doesn't get rigor mortis?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:31:09.184 --> 0:31:12.509]: 
  Yeah, so that's gonna help. That's it. Not because the biggest issue is that you get...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:31:13.487 --> 0:31:13.504]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:13.504 --> 0:31:14.044]: 
  Whatever

 SPEAKER_04 [0:31:27.139 --> 0:31:27.949]: 
  That's what I'm saying, like,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:27.949 --> 0:31:28.152]: 
  Bye!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:49.937 --> 0:31:53.447]: 
  And it's still when your tissue would be fucked.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:53.447 --> 0:31:58.915]: 
  No, it wouldn't. That issue is an issue. If it's frozen, your brother is dead.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:31:55.894 --> 0:32:01.007]: 
  issue the issue is that your tissue is dead no your tissue will be fucked up they can person they

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:59.843 --> 0:32:27.450]: 
  They can pers- they- that's not even the big issue, the way they do it. That's a huge issue. Here's an example, some kind of like frogs. They can be frozen for like a year at a time. But they have like a basic, like a natural antifreeze in their body. They get frozen for like a year, but their inside just still going. So you can find a way to do that, like keep your- like the inside still going, but slow down on. I think that's what you're gonna do. Like hibernating? Exactly, but yeah. Or basically sleeping rather than fucking dead and then putting ice.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:14.507 --> 0:32:14.946]: 
  It's okay.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:32:21.038 --> 0:32:23.772]: 
  like, like, hibernating? Exactly, but yes.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:32:27.450 --> 0:32:34.454]: 
  Once I saw the internet that you can get a fly put in the freezer for like a few days and then take it back out And just if you touch it

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:31.467 --> 0:32:31.619]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:31.619 --> 0:32:32.817]: 
  and just if you touch it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:32.817 --> 0:32:42.942]: 
  It starts like unfreezing.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:32:42.098 --> 0:33:20.303]: 
  Yeah, you ever get about those people who put flies on strings and put them in freezers to freeze it? That's what we're saying. Oh, the strings though. What's the strings? Yeah, no, yeah, but they do that. Yeah, that's so the- Yeah, they'll catch a fly put in the freezer, freeze it, then put a little string on it, then when you un-thought it, you'd like keep a pet fly on a leash. That's so cruel. It's funny. It's like flies. What did I do? I was when I was little, I found a fly, I was playing outside and there was a little fly that only had one wing. So I was crawling around. And I, so I kept it. I put it in a little jar with like dirt and grass and it was alive for like a few days. And it died. I was so sad. I cried. Why would you cry for a fly? Yeah, it was fuzzy, the buzzer.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:46.013 --> 0:32:51.143]: 
  So we're saying, hey, the strings though? What's the strings? Yeah, no, yeah, but they do that. Yeah, that's the story.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:55.699 --> 0:32:56.425]: 
  Delish

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:57.825 --> 0:33:00.947]: 
  It was funny. It was like flies. What day though?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:05.318 --> 0:33:05.942]: 
  I like the

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:05.942 --> 0:33:09.705]: 
  around and I so I kept it I put it in a little jar

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:14.177 --> 0:33:14.802]: 
  Goys!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:15.679 --> 0:33:18.008]: 
  Why would you cry for a fight?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:18.008 --> 0:33:32.723]:

Yeah, I went to America and now I'll still have my ex roommate. My ex roommate was supposed to take out the trash while he was gone and when I got back, he left. So he left fucking 50 trash bags.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:18.614 --> 0:35:22.090]:

No, gross. My friend Jason, I don't know if I ever told a story, did I ever tell a story? No. My first cigarette I ever had, I was like 14 years old. My friend Jason came over and said, dude, let's go smoke a cigarette. I was like, all right, we went to the woods and he had one, it was just one cigarette I don't know where it got from. He pulled it with like coffee. I don't know why I did it with coffee, like wheezing and shit. And then we came back to my house and immediately my mom was like, why do you smoke cigarettes?

  For me, it was even stupider. We just found a pack of cigarettes sitting on a couch in a future shop. And we were like, ha ha ha ha. Time to smoke these. And we went, it was my friend Melissa and I, like, I mean anyway, I went back to my house, she took half the pack, I took the other half. And I was like, I'm gonna try smoking. There wasn't even anybody around, so I don't know who I was trying to impress. I was just like, I'm gonna try smoking. So I, idiot me, like here at my room is in the basement, and then there's a little vent that just goes like right in the middle. Basically, yeah. So the one place that my dad sits all day long every day is just happens to be right above this vent that's also attached to my room. And it took him like 0.5 seconds after I lit this cigarette. And you know, I have this teeny tiny little football sized bit, like basement window that I cracked. What's your name again? Cracked open. And uh. Like Caesar the monkey?

Yeah, no, so I light this cigarette and I'm trying to smoke it out the window all sneaky because I'm thinking all the smoke is going out the window. But it's going up the vent which is directly above my head. And as soon as I light that cigarette, my dad, I just hear thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump. And like my door's locked and everything, right? So here I'm trying to open it. Like I put out the cigarette, throw it out the window and all the rest of them too. And he's like open the door and like, you know, I like open it after. I open it after a couple seconds of scrabbling and throwing away the cigarettes and like... Did he know? He knew straight away. Straight away, yeah. Did he get grounded? No, there was like this big intervention conversation. Oh Jesus. My mom sat me down, my dad was talking to me and they were like... Aw, awkward. We... Were you crying? No, no, no, they were like, you know what? We respect your decision if you, you know, just be honest with us. If you, this is something you want to do. It was like I was coming out to them or something. And they were just talking to me. I was like, no, I just found this package and I thought it was cool. Yeah, and they were like, where did you get this from? Who gave this to you? And I lied about it because I didn't want to, you know. They threw it at you. When I was younger, my friend, Jordan and I, we went down to Pike Place Market in Seattle. There's a magic shop there. And we were looking at these packets of like love potions or whatever. And at some point, I think I accidentally grabbed one and put it in my purse or something. Accidentally, huh? Accidentally.

  Oh my god. You're the ladies, Nikki. That was you. Oh. Fuck off. Now to the picture questions. Chris, you want to read the first one?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:59.108 --> 0:51:06.567]: 
  Uh, from MobileSpider. Yes, that is right. Do you guys have any warm-up tips before you draw?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:07.579 --> 0:51:08.085]: 
  Go Chris.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:51:08.085 --> 0:51:24.809]: 
  Um, I draw a square. Next? Oh, next one! Wait, is that it? Is it just one person to answer either? Are we all going around? Oh, I thought you were going to answer that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:20.202 --> 0:51:20.269]: 
  So, that's it. Thanks for watching. I'll see you in the next video.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:21.501 --> 0:51:28.504]: 
  Are we all going to answer that? Oh I thought no, I thought we were all going to answer it though. We're all going to answer that for real. I'm not going to goof like Chris over here. Look, okay, my warm up.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:28.504 --> 0:51:34.242]: 
  is I will draw I don't fucking know no you know no I'll draw for 30 minutes and that's my warm up I don't know what I'm

 SPEAKER_04 [0:51:31.879 --> 0:51:31.930]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:34.242 --> 0:51:36.672]: 
  I do war of sketches. I just try to

 SPEAKER_04 [0:51:36.014 --> 0:51:38.444]: 
  I do a lot of gestures.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:38.444 --> 0:51:41.903]: 
  you fucking dog howell that baba

 SPEAKER_04 [0:51:42.882 --> 0:51:55.437]: 
  Sabrina, these fucking two assholes, they don't even know what they're talking about. They just, they got their dicks in their hands, right? Ooh, the titty hand chest. No, it's too gay to be jealous of that. Oh! Oh! That was kinda... Oh! Sorry now.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:47.438 --> 0:51:50.543]: 
  Thanks, right? Oh, the tin-in chest. No, it was to the taste check.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:55.285 --> 0:51:58.997]: 
  When I do streams I... Hey shut up! I have an idea! No one cares about that!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:58.997 --> 0:52:39.987]: 
  I would have to shut your fucking mouth. Like what he said, I do sketches. I would do sketches for like 30 minutes to an hour if you want to. But a couple things you could do, try to do something different every day or if you want to try to pick something like hands or like a hand or something, fucking ears. Break it down. A lot of people, I said it before, but a lot of people get fucking overwhelmed because they think you have to get good anatomy and colors and a lot of people say, no, pick an ear. If you want to get good at an ear, just spend like two days out of the ear or whatever. Just pick something every day to get better at. I agree. Yeah, and also what's fun to do is take an old drawing like a year ago or two years ago and redraw that. Yeah, that goes out a lot and always comes out nice.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:52:37.354 --> 0:52:42.029]: 
  Yeah, that goes out a lot and it always comes out nicely. Yeah, it gives you a nice boost of confidence.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:40.932 --> 0:52:40.949]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:42.029 --> 0:52:46.686]: 
  Oh, this is good. You see how your style changes? See how you draw these differently? Yeah, exactly. That's what I'm gonna be sleeping in.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:52:45.488 --> 0:52:57.199]: 
  That's the thing about recently the Indian guy, but like it that made like the head shape much more peel it like it was kind of It was a good it was a really good drawing like two years ago But you made the head shape so much more like concise and nicer to look at you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:56.490 --> 0:53:14.445]: 
  I think it's just comes out to like different stuff that differently so that drug you know you can also do a Calcuit is I do Calcuit sometimes or even the take a cartoon character Fucking dexter's up. Whatever. I'm sure you grew up with it. Just draw that draw that your own style Yeah, you drew a fucking dexter's life picture. We all did that yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:14.445 --> 0:53:16.504]: 
  So that's my advice.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:53:16.504 --> 0:54:16.883]: 
  streams I asked the people I'm like yeah well I draw then I use that as a warm-up then then I do commissions on my streams so like just like I ask people what I draw and then I'll do that's my warm-up and that's all I do. What do you Sabrina? Depending on what I draw because I do a lot of figures and like like things related to drawing people usually like in the figure drawing classes I've taken they start off with really really quick stuff and then they gradually increase in 12 longer sort of things so you can kind of you know you start off really loose it like you're you're not probably not gonna like the first ones anyway so you're not committed to that just getting warmed up. Just fucking that away for you. Yeah yeah you do stuff that is short as 15 seconds 30 seconds you could do you could do faces you could do whole poses like gesture you know like quick stick-bang kind of thing just whip it out. Oh another website that so handy is Pixel Lovely you know what I was gonna say yeah Pixel Lovely. The 30 seconds is way too last for me. What do you mean the 30 seconds is way too last for me? I think it is. Pixel Lovely is great they have like so many pictures except that ginger girl always annoys me. You're like ginger girl. I think I've seen that yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:47.234 --> 0:53:50.372]: 
  Just getting warmed up. You just fucking out of the way for me. Yeah, yeah, you do stuff that...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:58.455 --> 0:54:02.995]: 
  I have another website that's so handy. It's Pixel Lovely. I was gonna say Pixel Lovely.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:04.041 --> 0:54:09.002]: 
  The 30 seconds is way too much for me. I need to castle it down. I used to use it. I think it is. I'm not sure it's double the number.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:12.614 --> 0:54:14.807]: 
  I'm a ginger girl

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:15.989 --> 0:54:31.058]: 
  I have Adam Phillips sent me a website that has different anatomical references and it's a fucking really good site. It has like what's the 3D one? I'll show it and I'll post it in the other description. And our blogs on Tumblr are really helpful too.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:54:22.755 --> 0:54:23.194]:

Because I've got a couple bookmarked too that I like. There's some that are good for like animals, faces, you know, whatever you feel like. Just pick something that you're not quite comfortable with.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:33.488 --> 0:54:37.454]: 
  All you got was that I have said bookmark. Yeah, I'll give you those back.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:45.992 --> 0:54:48.810]: 
  Go out of your cup of those wishes you can.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:54:47.460 --> 0:54:52.067]: 
  Yeah, just like an hour or two hours aside or something like that and then you know

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:50.920 --> 0:54:56.708]: 
  I could draw really good pigs, it's like well drawn, something besides that. Yeah, keep doing new stuff, don't do this.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:54:54.902 --> 0:55:16.283]: 
  Yeah, keep doing new stuff. Don't do the same thing. You'll get bored and stagnant and... Yeah. Go ahead, Niki. Yeah, basically, Serena summed it up the best. Just gestures and stuff. Also, like, another fun technique or another activity, whatever, is like, you draw a shape, and then you try to make something out of that shape. Yeah, that's all fun. It's fun games, too.

But the drawings are usually more vulgar because they have like little bits of concoming down. Yeah they are, it's much more like... Yeah. Oof. Yeah. Oof. Oof. Oof.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:29.459 --> 0:59:30.353]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:43.667 --> 0:59:54.299]: 
  I just draw like people. I'm trying to do backgrounds now too. Like vibrant colorful backgrounds. I usually do really like... What's the color palette where it's not very vibrant?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:44.494 --> 0:59:45.642]: 
  I'm turning black.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:54.518 --> 0:59:55.227]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:55.294 --> 1:00:11.005]: 
  No, no, you just like color wise. Oh like monochromatic? No, really, but like I just use, but then Zach was teaching me about colors being nice, being vibrant. So I'm trying to do that in backgrounds and they actually do look a lot nicer like yeah, just learning about that shape. Like limited color palettes? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:56.492 --> 0:59:58.011]: 
  Like color wise.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:08.862 --> 1:00:08.997]:

Take your time. That's a Italians music. It's an Italian music, and I don't wanna do solo, meet myeneas alliance, get together get together get together. Come together, get together get together get together.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:11.005 --> 1:00:13.604]: 
  Kinda. Cool. Playin' with these faces.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:00:15.072 --> 1:00:21.113]: 
  You're really good at just drawing like improvising that stuff like it decreases in the wrinkles in the face

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:15.494 --> 1:00:18.126]: 
  You're really good at just drawing, like improvising that stuff.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:18.126 --> 1:00:18.615]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:20.286 --> 1:00:51.522]: 
  I think my favorite stuff to draw is stuff that pulls and tugs on the skin. A buff guy is fun, but you can only draw buff guys, because his muscles are always going to be the same. But I always like to draw people who are old, because you're not only drawing a couple pictures, you're drawing a guy who is a regular guy, but also older. Then if you make them fat or give them facial hair, it's a guy that eats different stuff to it. Something that pulls on the skin in different ways. And the thing too is you can draw people at different stages of fatness, people from different stages of office. You can draw 30 old guys who are going to be different from the 80 old guy or 100 old guy.

  여기將자 방금

 SPEAKER_04 [1:00:48.501 --> 1:00:48.602]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:00:51.319 --> 1:01:04.397]: 
  You've been doing that thing lately. I was sitting next to Zach's office. He's drawing on a Cintiq Lake. He has on one layer it's like a young, like just a regular guy and then on the other layer it's like what he would look like as an old guy. That's what everybody could do.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:53.665 --> 1:00:53.918]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:02.946 --> 1:01:27.094]: 
  That's what really fun they could do. I recommend that it's a really fun exercise. Draw a... Or you could do a backwards. So you could draw like a 20 year old guy and be like, okay, I'll draw when he's 40 or 80. Or draw a really, really old guy. Or a really, really fat old guy or a really skinny old guy. Then do backwards. So what if this guy looks like he was 30? It's fun to go with that and just be like, how did the face change? How did the bones grow? How did the nose and ears grow? How did the eye sag? Did he lose hair? That's cool. It's good to keep...

 SPEAKER_04 [1:01:25.845 --> 1:01:34.519]: 
  It's good to keep drying activities fun. Yeah, because you can very easily get just be loose with it. Just make it organic. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:29.406 --> 1:01:29.760]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:31.819 --> 1:01:38.940]: 
  Just be loose with it, just make it organic. Yeah. Yeah. So I have to say faces of the hell, skin, ages and pulls and tugs and triggers.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:01:38.940 --> 1:01:48.458]: 
  Mm-hmm. Do you guys ever find like when you do warm up drawings and stuff like that where you actually like what you're drawing that you get caught up in your practice drawing? You're trying to finish it, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:02:03.713 --> 1:02:09.940]: 
  You like to draw all those cheating, kiss monsters and little things. Yeah, with holes for dicks and stuff. With our feet.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:07.004 --> 1:02:10.784]: 
  Yeah, with holes for dicks and stuff. Everyone asked my question.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:09.501 --> 1:02:14.260]: 
  Everyone asks me questions. Oh stop Christ.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:14.260 --> 1:02:15.492]: 
  Fuck off.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:02:15.340 --> 1:02:16.926]: 
  Need some tissue. It's true though.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:24.334]: 
  It's true, demons, dinosaurs, skulls, fucking buff monsters. I'm sorry, I didn't want to ask you. Big fat asses.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:02:20.605 --> 1:02:31.135]: 
  I was so excited to ask you. These big fat asses. Wait Chris, I have a question. Who's your favorite artist? Like you showed me someone's work, it was like really dark.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:25.077 --> 1:02:26.005]: 
  Mountains, what?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:31.135 --> 1:02:39.488]: 
  Oh, the fucking Baskinskia thing or something. Oh yeah! Oh, I got one. You show me him too. I hate that question because I don't like any fucking artist. Yeah, I'm kind of bad at that too. I don't know what artist by name.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:33.025 --> 1:02:39.454]: 
  Oh yeah, you should've been him too. I hate that question, cause I don't like any fucking artist. We're totally 80s. I don't know what artist by name.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:35.978 --> 1:02:35.995]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [1:02:39.437 --> 1:02:48.314]: 
  Like that's a real typical fucking triad answer I don't know. I like fucking any art. That looks cool. Yeah it's just a jazz note. Whatever you like.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:45.732 --> 1:02:45.799]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:45.799 --> 1:02:47.267]: 
  Yeah, it's just a diagonal.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:47.942 --> 1:03:50.228]: 
  Episode 22 I said that realistic art is hard to do but people can do it. What's really hard to do, it's really really challenging. It's simplifying that to an appealing art style. A lot of people ask me like for what cartoon style is it like? So I should post some. We can all do that too. You like kind of basic nice nice. A lot of people think I like John K but John K's art is really good to me sometimes or it's really appealing. Which one's John K again? It's Ren and Stippy. Oh! I'll call you. The TV show is really appealing to look at but John K's actual blog, it's not bad art. But it's not my kind of style. I think Billy and Mandy... It's not your refined taste. That's why Adam's Billy and Mandy. I think that's a way better art style. Billy and Mandy have one of the best art styles. It's season two. I like Ben 10. Spludgebub too was a great... But all the shows have a weird artistic peak though. It was like a weird... If you watch the beginning of those shows at the end of them, they get their bed. There's a nice middle ground.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:14.099 --> 1:03:16.917]: 
  Ja�<|sn|> RA!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:26.822 --> 1:03:29.067]: 
  I think it's totally... It's not your refined taste.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:03:28.004 --> 1:03:28.949]: 
  Omg fine taste

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:34.821 --> 1:03:38.213]: 
  What are the best art styles? Like season 2. I like Benz.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:47.410 --> 1:03:48.254]: 
  Waste of it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:50.819 --> 1:03:52.202]: 
  For both of those shows.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:03:50.903 --> 1:03:54.548]: 
  For both of those shows. Yeah, it's obviously like some 504 of the...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:53.839 --> 1:04:10.377]: 
  518

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:07.694 --> 1:04:11.727]: 
  It looks too clean now. Yeah, it's too clean. You just have this like undersea rusty grid to it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:07.997 --> 1:04:08.504]: 
  clean now.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:11.727 --> 1:04:22.830]: 
  Yeah, Billy Randy had that too by the way. It was he's is ahead like a kind of to clean So there's the same thing with that six season two or three. That's really good They use the same assets and stuff opposed a lot of different orders. I watched a new episode of

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:21.717 --> 1:04:38.980]: 
  I watched a new episode of Family Guy last night and it was the premise of the show was the roast of Peter Griffin and Like it cut to like Meg laughing and like her shoulders weren't even attached to her body when she was hurt like they were going up and down They just like came off her body when she was like laughing

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:38.575 --> 1:05:03.212]: 
  A lot of people think it's a bandwagon. Oh, it's so easy to hit a family item. If you look at it from an animation perspective, it's seriously heartbreaking. If you go back and watch season one, the comedy stuff I could forgive, it's gone up for 13 seasons. You're gonna run as shit. I don't like that. I'll just not watch this show if I don't like it. But from an animation perspective, it's objectively lazier. It has less frames, they reuse more, it's worse. It is.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:05:02.419 --> 1:05:09.372]: 
  So coming from an animation perspective where you guys are working really hard to do like frame by frame I wouldn't mind it there.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:07.397 --> 1:05:44.134]: 
  I wouldn't have minded that. The biggest thing was Chris and I used ToonBoot, which is we finally got a tutorial for how to use that. And when I used that, I was like, holy fuck, if the only guy who uses that too. So when we learned how to use it, it became way more obvious how lazy they were. When I thought they just did it like however, I was like, that's lazy. But they used so many fucking drag and drop, literally. The exact same assets. Like Peter got to do the same, Peter got to do the same. I didn't know they could do this. For example, if the show cuts to like nighttime with the color palette changes, you press a button, all the colors change. You don't have to go frame by frame with the color. It's all done. It's super canned.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:05:28.879 --> 1:05:31.444]: 
  The exact same assets like Peter Valkin and the St. Peter...

 SPEAKER_04 [1:05:42.970 --> 1:05:48.184]: 
  All their arm movements are just like dragging the dropping frames and then their arms will like fill in the in between which would buy

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:47.661 --> 1:06:07.202]: 
  Which would bother me if the show had lost budget or whatever. Yeah. Right? Like, but if you go back and watch season one or two, it had like a whatever smaller budget. The budget, the budget's got bigger. It's doubled. Yeah. And the animation looks worse. That's why it's heartbreaking. Yeah. So I'm not just fucking bandwagon. He's making so much money.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:06:04.148 --> 1:06:10.459]: 
  So I'm not just fucking bandwagon. He's making so much money and this show is getting worse. Yeah, it both

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:09.683 --> 1:06:21.209]: 
  Yeah. And by the way, it shouldn't look like Disney. I think comedy shows would lose their comedic essence if they looked too good. I think if you animated a Southpuk like Disney, it wouldn't look too funny. No, no.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:06:21.074 --> 1:06:29.494]: 
  There's stuff like the Animaniacs. It was really charming, but amazingly animated. Yeah, but it wasn't it I think I think the type of humor it was

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:28.296 --> 1:06:34.962]: 
  You could never animate like the Simpsons like like Disney or self-proc like Disney you have to have a specific style for it

 SPEAKER_04 [1:06:34.658 --> 1:06:50.942]: 
  Yeah yours is very like bouncy and like fast. It has to be fast. Yeah, I think it's important when you're trying to convey a humorous Yeah, show and whatever you have to match it with the right style. Absolutely. Yes, so that's that question answered in the fall over there

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:36.852 --> 1:06:37.949]: 
  That has to be fast.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:41.627 --> 1:06:44.412]: 
  Yeah. It can be too, it can be too. You have to.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:44.412 --> 1:06:44.631]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:45.947 --> 1:06:46.892]: 
  Absolutely. Yeah, so that's it.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:10:24.394 --> 1:10:30.419]: 
  He's like a pioneer. He would be all for this really shit. I think Disney's such a money hungry company. It's scary. He was a life

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:29.609 --> 1:10:34.131]: 
  He was alive, he'd seriously probably be one of the richest guys alive. Well he was when he was alive.

  Bill Gates is the rich spade. No, no, no, it was, it was, uh, who's the... The Rockefeller? Yeah, it was Rockefeller. He was worth like $600 billion adjusted for inflation.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:10:46.787 --> 1:10:52.660]: 
  Is Bill Gates still- No, he just gives away all his money, so he's not, but he would be. He gave away like a shit.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:52.170 --> 1:10:57.992]: 
  I actually already clayed back up a little bit. I think he's number one and two now. He put back up a little bit. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:10:57.705 --> 1:11:02.447]:
