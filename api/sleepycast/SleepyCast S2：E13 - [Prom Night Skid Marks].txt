 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:46.904 --> 0:09:48.287]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:55.679 --> 0:10:01.990]: 
  to fight like weird bacteria that it's not used to. I think that's why people do it. I think like evolutionary, like it's an evolutionary thing. Kids.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:01.619 --> 0:10:37.900]: 
  Kids do it because they're bored and it's something they can nibble on. Mucous to me is really putrid because it's nasty. Also, it's vagina juice. I mean, yeah. It's different. There's a difference between your holes that release. Your oozy. Mucous over your fucking nose and ears that release mucus. Because those seem more gross than your private parts. Our whole body just constantly secretes. Yeah, like sweat and stuff. Sweat and mucus and earwax and fucking cum and shit and sweat and all sorts of goopy gross crap.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:09.027 --> 0:10:12.942]: 
  That's what vagina juice is all about. I mean, yeah, well, it's different.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:12.942 --> 0:10:14.123]: 
  There's a difference between...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:15.085 --> 0:10:16.350]: 
  Tell me you discuss everything Ts Killer There Will BeV resignation participating

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:21.852 --> 0:10:22.155]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:37.613 --> 0:10:41.342]: 
  Just consume shit and just sweat it out. You know essentially what-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:40.077 --> 0:12:10.797]: 
  You know essentially our bodies just leak. We are just like, our skin is like a sponge. Like if you squeezed us hard enough, right? Like I think there was like, like I forgot what kind of movie it was, but somebody gets pushed into like a pressure chamber and all of the pores, you know, like, so all of your pores have like, zit pus in it. Yeah, like blackheads. Even little ones, even little ones, right? But the pressure was so much that every pore got crushed and it looked like their face, it looked like those Play-Doh spaghetti things. Like just all this goop just poured out of every pore in their face. Oh, that's shit. Here's something that I always thought was also interesting. If we're on the topic of like gross, mucusy stuff, this is something I noticed growing up and it's kind of, I don't know if it's still true, but girls have like an infatuation with kind of like gross things. Not like saying like they love like, you know, scat and shit, but they like, when I was growing up, my sister was obsessed with scabs. I wouldn't pick my scab and she'd be like, you should pick your scab. Yeah. And I'm like, I'm not gonna pick my scab. But she was obsessed with trying to pick my scab. And I'm like, what's your fucking problem? And growing up, I realized that like, she used to like digging in the ground looking for like bugs. But the older she got, she was fucking terrified of bugs. So it's kind of like a thing you grow out of when you get older where you kind of, depending on who you are, what you kind of. Yeah, it's weird because it's funny you say that because that's exactly- This is just completely biased by experience. No, no, no, no, but I had ex-girlfriends and whatnot that they wanted to like, if I had like an ingrown hair, they wanted to take a needle. Yeah. And they wanted to pry it out. If they had like a- They said wanting to pop it. Yeah, they would always wanna pop it. They would always try and pop a black pin. My mom would be like that, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:42.996 --> 0:10:44.042]: 
  Our skin is a good spot.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:56.277 --> 0:10:58.184]: 
  plus in it even little ones.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:05.980 --> 0:11:07.667]: 
  like spaghetti things like just

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:10.637 --> 0:11:12.207]: 
  in their face.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:16.020 --> 0:11:16.341]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:58.311 --> 0:21:01.077]: 
  It's not fake. Okay, they have every girl I've been with. All three of them. Have pussy streaks. No, they have. Save that for the podcast. It is a podcast. No, when I had bad athletes' foot when I was a kid. Oh yeah, man. I really, you know what it really just comes down to is just washing your feet, like really drying them before you leave. Instead of getting out of shower and just putting on a thing, just like washing them in the dark. But there are chemical things. They're like when you're going through puberty and other things, when your body is changing, things happen. This wasn't just a matter of washing my feet. This was, it was like when a snake sheds its skin. Like I literally had turtleneck, like rings of dead skin around every toe. I mean, pull, like you could pull off almost like a sheet of it off of my foot. And it was like, and it would hurt and it would be pussy and whatever. And we used to have to wrap my feet. Wait, it would be pussy? Yes, so we'd have to wrap. That's not a good start. And we would have to wrap my feet in Vaseline and wax paper and then put a sock on over that. You know, I have quaint. This is when I was a kid. I have quaint athlete's feet. I don't have fucking. I don't have it anymore, but that was. What are the symptoms? Just that? No, you'd have like cracking. You just have like dead skin around the toes. Yeah. And like loose. It's just like white skin. Yeah. You're fine. It's a fun goal like infection, but it's like the most harmless one. It's not like you have fucking gang brain. I thought everyone had athlete's feet. You don't have. I think anyone can get it. What's, you don't have fucking gout. Okay. It's nothing of that caliber, but it's like, it's like, you know, you have a little bit of a dead skin on your feet. What is gout? As far as I'm concerned, it's like a fucking tumor on the side of your leg. I thought I had it. On the side of your foot. Yeah. Yeah. There's a swell. It's a swelling. It's like fucking elephantitis on the side of your feet. Yeah. There's no way you have gout unless you're fucking sure. No, no, no, no. When I was in Alaska, no, and if you touched it, I, if I had a bed sheet resting on my foot, it felt like somebody was stabbing me in the fucking arteries. It was really, really intense when I had it. And then maybe you did have gout, but maybe you had like child symptoms. You know, a lot of the things that create gout is drinking too much that can inflame because you build up like lactic acid. I do not yet.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:04.065 --> 0:19:05.449]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:49.457 --> 0:21:50.132]: 
  for<|tl|> dz

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:01.776 --> 0:22:02.856]:

  Get that dunk in.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:26.245 --> 0:22:26.498]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:27.713 --> 0:22:31.881]: 
  I'm just succumbed to the fact that I'm going to get kidney stones. I drink mounds of coffee.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:31.830 --> 0:23:59.175]: 
  Dude, I've been drinking this fucking thing I got at Wawa. It's that Jeff introduced me to. It's, I think it's called like, pure tea. Like, pure tea. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fantastic. That's really good stuff. It's, I get this like, unsweetened iced tea. And I've been getting this lemon tea. Love that. And I drink that like, everything. Jeff gets iced tea every day. Every time he's out. It's so good. And it's like. But he still drinks all that iced tea even after he got those kidney stones? Yeah, no, he. Every time we go out, he's. He said himself that he like, will just go to the bathroom and piss out some stones. Yeah, he's like, he just pisses out rocks. It's nothing. He sounds like someone's pouring gravel into a toilet bowl. Yeah, I probably drink more ice tea than Jeff. I drink iced tea every day and I drink mounds of coffee and I drink diet soda. But I think it's still good to drink water. I do drink a lot of water too. I drink, I just drink. That's why I'm always pissing. Then you're fine. You're not going to get kidney stones. I'm constantly in any case. You shouldn't worry about kidney stones. Kidney stones are for people who drink fucking Mountain Dew 24-7. Kidney stones are mainly what calcium? Calcium build up. Yeah, calcium just. Mineral. So could you just fucking piss out a couple of those, throw them in a bottle and for anyone with a calcium deficiency, you just fucking take two of those and call it a day? Yeah, but probably. Yeah. Probably. I'd rather drink milk than someone's dick stones. It's like, no, hold on. Okay, you don't need bananas. I have, I have kidney stones saved up. I've dried them out so they're able to be swallowed. They eat it. You're like, oranges are calcium, right? Oranges can have calcium. They add calcium. Which one has calcium? Well, oranges are good. Milk is the big one. Milk. Fish has some vegetables. We drink fucking milk all the time. Well, it's bad for like, mantinis apparently. Milk? Yeah, because it does have. The hormones. It does have.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:38.850 --> 0:22:42.175]: 
  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that's good stuff. That's really good stuff.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:44.520 --> 0:22:44.790]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:45.854 --> 0:22:47.507]: 
  I love that. I love it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:47.507 --> 0:22:49.431]: 
  Every time he's out.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:53.616 --> 0:22:56.333]: 
  No, every time we go out he's... He said himself!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:58.560 --> 0:22:59.438]: 
  Yeah, he's like,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:59.438 --> 0:23:01.159]: 
  This is out rocks nothing he sounds like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:03.235 --> 0:23:05.378]: 
  I probably drink more ice cream than Jeff.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:08.095 --> 0:23:08.618]: 
  But I think

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:10.002 --> 0:23:11.487]: 
  I do drink a lot of water too though.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:20.447 --> 0:23:20.684]: 
  Can you hear me?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:22.337 --> 0:23:25.054]: 
  calcium build up. Yeah, calcium just...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:31.517 --> 0:23:33.019]: 
  Yeah, but probably.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:44.646 --> 0:23:45.422]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:45.422 --> 0:23:45.591]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23 --> 0:23:54.653]: 
  I really. Yeah, and uh, I Play Add Calc, which one has calcium? Is it your milk? Milk. Fish has. We drink. We drink. Appreciate. Milk. We drink. We drink. What all of us? Well, we can't at all. Nap. It's a little suspicious. Because tilapia is a dirty world. What kind of Avengers does that? Like oppression İdCR, which one is the mostww.. Is it a checklist?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:56.880 --> 0:24:05.993]: 
  Yeah, because it does a hormone. It does have estrogen in it or I asked you call it estrogen we call it estrogen All the estrogen, but yeah, it's gonna give you like titties. Yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:00.930 --> 0:24:57.698]: 
  We call it estrogen. It gives you like titties. Does an estrogen also make people gay? It gives you like feminine tendencies. I'm basing this off the way you got your body. No, it's a hormonal thing where it's you know like testosterone is for guys. Yeah, estrogen is for girls. Yeah, estrogen. So if you fill your body with estrogen you'll start feeling female tendencies. And you will grow fat. And like the parts like your titties will become more perky and you'll feel the sensations women feel. There was definitely a phase when people were concerned because they were giving like a lot of any animals that they want to like grow bigger faster and produce more stuff they will give they'll give hormones. So you know and for the longest time I guess people just never considered the fact that if you're everything you're eating and drinking has been tampered with hormonally that somehow it'll trickle down to you. You know girls who are like they're like ripped and stuff. Yeah. They're emitting huge amounts of hormon.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:01.943 --> 0:24:03.495]: 
  Master jingle, he's Luke

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:11.224 --> 0:24:13.806]: 
  I'm gonna basically this after we've got your body. No, it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:18.885 --> 0:24:21.147]: 
  One more time for girls.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:25.332 --> 0:24:26.462]: 
  And you will grow massively.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:31.407 --> 0:24:32.942]: 
  There was definitely a phase where...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:32.942 --> 0:24:34.005]: 
  It's true. It's fact.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:42.426 --> 0:24:42.848]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:42.848 --> 0:24:43.337]: 
  You know what I mean?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:46.594 --> 0:24:46.949]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:50.982 --> 0:24:53.429]: 
  little trickle down to you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:55.268 --> 0:24:58.896]: 
  Yeah, they're in meeting huge amounts of they take tea they take a saster

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:58.829 --> 0:25:09.409]: 
  And you know how like their clits turn into almost like huge or longer clits? They might as well just turn into mini dicks. They pretty much do. It's because they're taking hormones. They're enhancing their penis size.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:01.140 --> 0:25:08.279]: 
  like huge or longer clicks. They might as well just turn into mini dicks. It's because they're taking hormones. They're enhancing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:09.409 --> 0:25:14.607]: 
  That's what they're doing, testosterone. Exactly. Apparently, I don't know how true this is, but...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:14.168 --> 0:25:56.997]: 
  Every gross so big they could like shove it in the guys, but I mean that's only in like Japanese anime Do they do that in an amaze really? Yeah, the clip the clip decks they turn into click. Oh, wow There's like a range right there's like a pussy Yeah, there's a pussy and there's a pussy that the clip turns into a penis, right?

  See you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:48.492 --> 0:25:50.415]: 
  The balls are inside there. I'm not speaking.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:56.929 --> 0:26:01.452]: 
  Yeah, it has a dick and it has a pussy under the dick and the balls are tucked inside their bodies

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:01.452 --> 0:26:24.587]: 
  So their balls are actually- No, their balls lay over. I heard that they have a dick, they have a pussy, and then the balls are inside, so if they decide they want to become a man, they can descend the balls, they can get surgery, so the balls come out. Yeah, you- If they want to become a woman, they get their dick chopped off. This is a gooey duck. What the hell is that? It's- it looks like a fucking- It looks like a f- It looks like a clam with a big, fat, doggy, doggy dick coming out of it. That looks like a bottle of fucking barbecue sauce.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:11.087 --> 0:26:14.091]: 
  This is a gooey duck.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:14.985 --> 0:26:15.441]: 
  It's...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:16.504 --> 0:26:17.129]: 
  It looks like a f-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:19.862 --> 0:26:22.225]: 
  Dude, all good doggy dick coming out of it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:23.946 --> 0:26:33.936]: 
  I'm thinking of the gout things we were talking about earlier and the rotten legs and stuff just that looks like a big fat rotten Dick to me right now. It does that's coming out of a shell. I'm getting horny take

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:30.156 --> 0:26:45.479]: 
  It does. Someone out of a shell. I'm getting horny. Take your phone. I'm getting horny. I'm getting sick. This is because there's this like four year old Asian kid holding it up to its face. Yeah, he's holding up a rotting dick. Okay, so this is something I also kind of want to talk about because I am a cynical person to a degree.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:37.429 --> 0:26:38.324]: 
  Yeah, he's holding up.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:42.762 --> 0:26:43.319]: 
  Ja.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:45.428 --> 0:26:46.879]: 
  I don't think you're finished.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:46.626 --> 0:28:47.502]: 
  I can be cynical. I can look at something and I think you're a lot less But it's like I realized now that like cynicism that has blood into me It's almost like why be cynical because it's like it really doesn't mean anything Right, it's like okay So if you don't like something that somebody likes you don't have to make a huge deal Yeah, then it's like well you clearly don't like the person's thing They don't like so it's like when I see something like if I see a movie or I see some art and it's stuff And it's like it's kind of hit me now at this point that it's kind of like Why would I even worry about just stuff that comes out? Yeah, like a game comes out or something comes out and it's like wow this sucks It's like well this clearly isn't for me It's a lose-lose situation because when you're when you're super cynical like by nature by default right two things are happening One is is that you're spending a lot of energy and time just hating on things for the sake of hating Yes, and the second thing is you're being closed-minded things that you might actually enjoy Yeah, you're just you're just automatically shutting the door on it like I was gonna say before There was a time the quarry that I knew back in the day if I was like hey quarry Do you want to come over and watch every single Star Wars movie tonight? There is a quarry I know that would have said I'd rather fucking jab my eye with a broken pencil and pour fucking Acid into it. Yeah, then do that fuck you Star Wars is gay and lame and fake and stupid I would you never say the fight You say fake and gay B3 yes, but the fact that you you did you did watch it you watched all of them and you enjoyed them Yeah, and I think that that is a testament to I think to be more open-minded But then it comes to things like yeah, but you didn't like all of them That's a thing too, but you watch them because but then it's like talking about things like I was thinking like I saw Deadpool Yeah, it's a great movie But if you go into if you're someone who's cynical all the time you're just like oh man a fucking I hate I hate anything Yeah, that caters to the specific thing they're trying to cater to and it's like well you kind of you if you're going into something like okay So Deadpool's like it always a try hard all he fucking does is break the fourth wall and he has random jokes I really thought I was gonna be a fucking taco

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:48.482 --> 0:26:49.005]: 
  I think you're a little...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:49.005 --> 0:26:50.946]: 
  a lot less cynical than before. Bye.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:50.946 --> 0:26:51.081]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:03.434 --> 0:27:03.872]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:06.572 --> 0:27:06.876]: 
  So it's

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:20.174 --> 0:27:20.309]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:21.507 --> 0:27:22.097]: 
  It's a loser.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:31.851 --> 0:27:32.408]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:35.327 --> 0:27:35.344]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:02.361 --> 0:28:07.474]: 
  You know, you say fake and gay. I'm like, fake and gay! Look it up, E3.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:10.765 --> 0:28:11.558]: 
  and watching.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:18.375 --> 0:28]: 
  புத்துவிடு...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:20.046 --> 0:28:21.008]: 
  And you didn't like all of it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:21.008 --> 0:28:22.695]: 
  That's a thing too, but you wash it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:45.240 --> 0:28:50.421]: 
  I really thought the movie was gonna be that. I really thought that was gonna be the movie. I thought it was gonna be Chris Jesus.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:49.392 --> 0:29:50.952]: 
  I knew it was gonna be cringey. The thing is, the thing is, like, if you go in with that high expectation, it'll ruin it. Even if you enjoyed it, you'll still somehow have some sort of negative thing to it. But if you go into the movie and you go like, you know what, I know what it's supposed to be, but I'm gonna completely blank my mind and assume so that at the worst, it's gonna be a cringey rump, but at the best, it's gonna have parts that I will remember and laugh at. But you're already accepting that could be an option. Rather than, from the moment you go in, only accepting that you're not gonna like it. Yeah, and I mean, like, well, I guess it's also kind of like a bias, because I like Ryan Reynolds. I've always liked Ryan Reynolds. I don't like his serious roles where he plays like a hard cop or he plays like somebody that's like, has the world on his shoulder. It's like, it's like Ryan Reynolds has always been a goofy fuck. He was a goofy fucking waiting and he was a goofy fucking Van Wilder. He has like that really creepy, fast-talking, old Jim Carrey style, like a, me, myself, and I range in Carrey. I actually see it right now. Yeah, he's a totally me, myself, and I range in Carrey. We, he's almost like, I'm fucking insane. I got stuff to say, but I can't say it because I'm always saying for myself. But that's what I'm saying. I like, it's really hard to be, really had some an idea.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:11.717 --> 0:29:12.409]: 
  Rather than

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:15.902 --> 0:29:15.970]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:27.749 --> 0:29:29.436]: 
  It's like Ryan Reynolds is

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:29.436 --> 0:29:29.655]: 
  always

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:34.515 --> 0:29:34.954]: 
  He has a

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:39.021 --> 0:29:39.375]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:40.489 --> 0:29:41.502]: 
  I actually see right now.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:41.502 --> 0:29:42.869]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:46.530 --> 0:29:47.037]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:48.285 --> 0:29:49.500]: 
  because the whole century itself is real.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:49.500 --> 0:29:49.973]: 
  Really hard to...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:50.952 --> 0:29:59.440]: 
  really funny I think like he's one of the only people to pull that off like you know to be like a good looking dude well that's rude what's ever Mick what's his name I shut up

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:55.390 --> 0:35:22.697]: 
  Wow, that's rude. He's never Mick. What's his name? God, I am neither. Shut up. Tony Stark is handsome and funny. Oh, Robert Downey Jr. Robert Downey Jr. No, he's funny. Yeah, but he's like one of the most. He's one of them. He is, dude. I don't care what people say. I thought he was amazing in Tropic Thunder. Yeah, he's fucking hilarious. And he's funny in general. Not just this black guy. I see Australian guy. I thought he was just a great- He's funny outside like Iron Man. Like, I thought he's charming and funny in that. He's actually just funny in general. He's a funny person. And he's like- I mean, it's really rare, though, is what I'm saying. There's not many of those- I'm really happy that even after rehab, he didn't crash and become a fucking buzzkill. No, I just went up the hill. Yeah, a lot of people would have attributed his fast-talking wittises, his lightning fast comebacks and whatnot to be part of his co-condition. But even after stopping, I mean, he's gone back a few times, but clearly that's just a part of who he is. He is a fast-thinking, fucking- Yeah, he's just a witty guy. He's a quick. Yeah. And he's good looking. And his penis is very pretty. I'd give him one. I'd give him- I'd polish it. So Deadpool was rated R. And it's actually almost jarring to watch a superhero movie where when they shoot somebody, their fucking head explodes. Yeah. And it's Fox. Yeah, it's Fox. It is amazing that that movie got made and they got made the way that it got made. I mean, even Jeff- We're talking about cynicism. Jeff said he really liked it from what I recall. It's a great movie. I've never seen it before. No, no, it's a great movie. And it's like people are like, oh, you're overhyping it. This is frozen all over again. It's like, no, this is not- you know what? You get to stick out of your ass. It's like going this fucking movie- I haven't seen it. I'm just excited. It is legitimately a good movie. There are things that bother me currently. Like I- you know, it's the origin story. It's gonna explain Deadpool. You're not gonna go into fucking Deadpool when he's gonna break the fourth wall for 40 goddamn minutes. No, it's gonna be- he's gonna have to explain his existence. Well, you have to have a wall in order to break it. You can't just be breaking it the whole fucking time. But the origin thing is entertaining. It's funny. It's like even some parts may be slow and you know, there could be parts where the shots, you know, it's more unique and crazy and he like stops and does all this stuff. But you could tell they had a vision. They stuck with the vision. It felt like everything was kind of intact. Like there was no stuff they left out. They just were like, okay, we have this. We need this. We need to say all this stuff in a small amount of time. We're just gonna do it. And that's what it- that's what it delivered on. But it's so great watching a movie that's rated R and when somebody gets their fucking limbs cut off, their fucking arm flies off and there's blood fucking everywhere. There's blood everywhere. That's the blood. But when you see like a movie like The Punisher, like I would love a new Punisher movie and I would fucking- Oh, if they took it to that level. Oh, God, yes. And I would absolutely like the game Punisher. If they did Punisher the Game movie, it'd be fucking amazing. And if they did new Ghost Rider, this rated R, it'd be fucking great. Ghost Rider doesn't need to be rated R. It can be. I'm just saying because Ghost Rider is a ghost. It's not like he's bleeding a lot. And even in the comic when he fucked with people, he wasn't like a dismembering guy. I mean, he did run over people and he did like choke people. I feel like it could definitely be more gory than the kid friendly Nicholas Cage bullshit we saw. Exactly. But it's like- That CG was so embarrassing. It's almost like a breath of fresh air to see a superhero movie, superhero, it quotes. That's actually gory and rated R. It actually feels like they're not talking down to you for once. Like you feel like this is what I've been waiting for. I've wanted this for so long. Do this more often. I feel like Spawn could definitely have a remake. Oh, yeah. Even though I feel like Spawn's time is kind of over unfortunately. I don't know. Skud, maybe a Skud movie? Well, I see a movie, right? And I'm just like, that movie would have been better if it was R. Because all these movies that come out, it's like they've always been PG-13. But PG-13 is not how it used to be. It's dissolved into like this last second cutaway bullshit where if there was going to be murder, like if somebody was going to be stabbed, the shot would cut away before any impact was done. You would see the expression of someone being stabbed and maybe you see the aftermath of them pulling away. But you wouldn't see the impact of the stab and you wouldn't see the expression of the stab, the aerial view. And it's like, I feel like the magic of that has been lost. All these movies that come out by a dime or a dozen, any kind of gore or any kind of violence is just like cutaways to anything that actually happens. It's interesting because I recently looked at the reviews of the Dark Knight series because I thought they were rated, I thought at least one of them was rated R, but they were all PG-13. Really? Yeah. Okay, so if you were to think of an example, if you saw World War Z, it was a fucking pile of shit. Yeah. It sucked. But if you saw the unrated, uncut version, it is way different. It is actually like, you know, when you see the zombies, they look like dead, they have blood and shit. They have shell over their faces. When they shoot them, brains fucking splatter everywhere. It's a legitimate horror movie. And the scenes that should have gore actually have gore in. There's been a comic book before. Yeah, yeah, and it actually has like sounds of gore. So when you see this stuff, it's like you're like, you see it now, the pusification they do in movie theaters, and you see the ones they released later on fucking DVD on uncut version. It's like, why can't you just fucking release that? Right. Well, it's about money. So if you have like... But people wouldn't see that. Right. But Deadpool, it's main audience, right? Yeah. Yes, there's a lot of adult viewers that want to see it. But do you have any fucking kids? How many fucking kids want to see it? That was my point that I was going to say. And that becomes such a... They're taking, the studios, especially like Fox, know that if they make it rated R, they are cutting out a huge demographic. I'm saying that, I swear to God, I shouldn't say that anymore. I was going to say like, do you think that the fact that it's R and it's... No, the fact that it's R has nothing to do with it. It's just the fact...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:01.245 --> 0:30:04.452]: 
  Oh, Robert Downey Jr. Robert Downey Jr. No, he's funny.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:05.059 --> 0:30:07.624]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:22.491 --> 0:30:23.250]: 
  He's a funny...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:27.233 --> 0:30:28.009]: 
  I'm really happy that

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:32.025 --> 0:30:34.388]: 
  I mean, a lot of people went up the hill.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:50.014 --> 0:30:54.739]: 
  Yeah, he's just a witty guy. He's quick. Yeah. And he's good looking. He is. And his penis is very...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:54.739 --> 0:30:55.988]: 
  Very pretty.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:55.364 --> 0:30:56.005]: 
  I'd give one.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:06.265 --> 0:31:06.906]: 
  The end

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:11.614 --> 0:31:13.369]: 
  Jeff, we're going to talk about cynicism.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:14.685 --> 0:31:18.297]: 
  It's a great movie. I've always been forum. No, no, it's a great movie. And it's like,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:19.832 --> 0:31:19.849]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:24.794 --> 0:31:26.700]: 
  Why haven't seen it? I'm just excited.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:39.998 --> 0:31:41.027]: 
  Will you have to have a water?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:42.529 --> 0:31:44.352]: 
  I can't just be breaking it the whole fucking time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:17.579 --> 0:32:18.996]: 
  And it's like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:22.169 --> 0:32:22.439]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:23.654 --> 0:32:26.742]: 
  movie and I'll they took it to that level god yes and I was absolutely

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:27.670 --> 0:32:28.429]: 
  Punisher if they didn't

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:57.184 --> 0:32:58.332]: 
  A breath of fresh air.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:06.010 --> 0:33:06.398]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:14.228 --> 0:33:15.983]: 
  Oh yeah, yeah, the thing though is I can't

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:18.126 --> 0:33:18.430]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:25.197 --> 0:33:25.956]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:09.527 --> 0:34:09.882]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:35.414 --> 0:34:36.949]: 
  Or in comic book before. Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:51.005 --> 0:34:51.934]: 
  Right.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:53.014 --> 0:34:56.001]: 
  So if you have like- But people wouldn't say that. Right.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:03.595 --> 0:35:05.451]: 
  Kids wanna see it. And that because

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:04.945 --> 0:35:05.890]: 
  And that becomes such a-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:12.083 --> 0:35:13.450]: 
  I'm saying that, I swear to God.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:12.944 --> 0:35:15.458]: 
  I swear I'm not sure. But they're not anymore. That's like 10 minutes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:14.496 --> 0:35:14.918]: 
  for more.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:21.634 --> 0:35:29.582]: 
  It's just the fact that... Do you think that takes away... Do you think other studios will see that and go, hmm, all it doesn't actually take away from the... No, I think that's what should happen.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:27.304 --> 0:36:51.443]: 
  No, I think that's why I'm glad that this is happening. I'm glad that this is putting shade and Fucking shade on the previous thing and being like listen, okay? You can make a movie with fucking balls and make it rated R if it's a good movie people will see it If it's a fucking shitty movie and it's rated R no one's gonna see it. It's like you kind of need it's not so much It's Marvel. It's just that you need something that grabs people's attention Deadpool for instance is something that grabs I feel like certain ones like a Captain America movie You probably could have like a rated R or if you're gonna do something with like black widow or something where you could have Like what it's really like for a Russian spy like what they really had to do like you get really fucking dark and that would be great Yeah, that would actually be pretty cool. And that would make you have to you have to go that far Exactly just to make a good movie if you have to go that far just to make it a good movie Then maybe the movie isn't as good of a movie as you think it is But if it is a part of it and you're actually Dumbing it down. Yeah, you know that then I think then you're cutting the balls off your story But if you're just throwing extraneous gore on top of it for shock value I think it's just a matter of balance if it fits then it fits Yeah, and anybody who has seen Daisy and thinks it's a like a waste of time. What was he it was such a waste of time I Recommend seeing the uncut version. I don't know the story change because I thought the story was just trash. There is a

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:09.357 --> 0:36:10.994]: 
  Yeah, that would actually be pretty cool.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:10.994 --> 0:36:12.090]: 
  Maybe it is a D.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:12.090 --> 0:36:12.360]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:13.103 --> 0:36:13.491]: 
  go there.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:13.491 --> 0:36:15.432]: 
  just to make a good movie.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:41.166 --> 0:36:42.904]: 
  a waste of time.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:44.575 --> 0:36:44.794]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:48.135 --> 0:36:49.975]: 
  I don't know if the story changed because I thought

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:50.987 --> 0:36:53.333]: 
  There is a world, there's an uncut version? I didn't even know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:52.995 --> 0:41:47.380]: 
  Yeah, there's an uncut version with like everything that was all his foreskin on dirty gritty and Dude the beginning this is this here's day Z spoilers guys. Hey, or world war Z. I'm a doctor Everyone's a zombie. All right. We got the guy. He's got the kid though. Also. Yeah, I'm Brad Pitt Let's go find him they go to Hong Kong. Oh, he's dead He like falls down in the head the end and then they just go around It's still like the same but the problem is like, you know, they had to shrink it into a movie So they had to like cut in like a bunch of comics Dynamic with you know, he loved his kids all that shit But here's the difference the difference between seeing that is the equivalence of seeing a movie That actually finally like doesn't talk down to you when someone is shot. It's not like this pitiful like yeah fall down It's like actual like blood and shit and it's like, you know the impact when you cut something There's actually like yeah, yeah, it's zombies. Okay, uh fucking news flashed anybody who's ever seen a zombie before All zombie movies are they eat flesh? Okay? Okay? Okay? Yes by that yes by that account. I agree. I mean look if you're gonna do a romantic zombie movie Whatever, okay If you want to make you want to see one then maybe okay, yeah 13 But if you're gonna do a straight zombie movie, you're right. Yeah, it's like saying you're gonna make a PG 13 alien movie Are PG 13 predator movie? It's like why are you even doing this? What are you doing? It makes no sense. It's it literally makes no fucking sense It's a movie about things that eat people. It's like how fucking more obvious with Gord you need to be it's like blood should be on Their face. It's like take walking dead. Okay. Look you see walking. They see what they're doing. Yeah, that's a zombie Okay, it's not these people who walk around with dirt on their fucking face. These aren't a bunch of Did you ever see the walking dead show the walking dead show? Yeah, there was I forgot which season was I think it was It was like Terminus or whatever it was called they again spoilers. Sorry, but at the beginning of the season They're at this place where they think it's like a safe haven, but it's not and they line up everybody in front of this trough There's like 30 people lined up on their knees with their hands tied behind their back And they're all leaning over this trough, right? And there's guys with clipboards with all their names and whatever just you know, basically accounting for everybody there There's two guys Wearing like these like white kind of like protection splatter suits or whatever and one guy has a baseball bat And the other guy's got a knife and it just they just go down the line They just baseball bat someone's head and then you see the whole fucking thing happen in real time They like you know hit somebody over the head they clunk over Somebody just reaches over slits their throat and they're and they just start to bleed into the trough Just down the list like boom boom boom and the next person sees you can see everybody fucking getting killed and It was one of the better scenes just because they weren't glamorizing it or like you know playing it up It was just so brutally raw and honest about how Undramatic and pitiful what you know, just how and that to me was so fucking frightening But in order to pull that off, I don't think there is a PG 13 way you could get Tell that story to tell that scene when you kill somebody. Yeah, we we are made with these this thing called blood And it unfortunately spills out whenever you kill someone Yeah, and it's like we shouldn't be ignoring the fact that this this is a common This is a common phenomenon. We shouldn't be trying to like fool the audience kids aren't fucking retarded They understand that blood exists. They understand when you shoot stab kill somebody, okay? 80% of the people who see these fucking movies play Call of Duty and play these fucking war games They know what blood is if games or movies did influence kids. Let's just say let's just say this Yeah, okay, right. We'll just it will assume that any stimuli we get does influence us in some way, right? Yeah, so let's just say if they saw gore Let's say a violence of like a zombie movie or war thing where it was like very real like someone got shot in their head Literally you see brains you see it is half of their face. It's just gross dude Yeah, or the way we see it in a lot of PG, you know situations where it's like there's a bullet There's like maybe a droplet of blood they fall over the whole So that or they cut away. Do you think if they showed just how gory like when you cut someone across the stomach? They're fucking intestines spill everywhere. Do you think kids would be more or less? Pro violence like more or less. I think they're gonna be against it I think I think you can scare them straight a little bit I mean, I think some people would say you desensitize them, but I don't think so No, I think I even as an adult every time I know a man me me too I'm not a fan of like blood in real life right. I am like bleeding at some point right get woozy I I can't handle blood. I can't handle it's almost like by 13 of buying violence We make it seem just so much so much more palatable so much easier because we're trying to make it okay everyone seen those

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:55.763 --> 0:36:56.995]: 
  Got all his foreskin on.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:58.109 --> 0:36:59.189]: 
  Yeah, in the face.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:08.487 --> 0:37:09.010]: 
  though also.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:11.136 --> 0:37:11.440]: 
  No, we're not.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:15.490 --> 0:37:16.502]: 
  It's still a big one.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:16.502 --> 0:37:17.329]: 
  Bicycles Bio

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:23.573 --> 0:37:24.990]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:43.620 --> 0:37:44.380]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:50.117 --> 0:37:54.944]: 
  All zombie movies should be rated R. They eat flesh, okay? Okay, okay, so by that, yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:54.944 --> 0:37:55.669]: 
  by that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:00.529 --> 0:38:05.727]: 
  Yeah, whatever. Okay, if you want to make fucking more C1, then maybe PG-13.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:08.815 --> 0:38:09.642]: 
  Ele각 as cobras...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:15.599 --> 0:38:19.007]: 
  What are you doing? It makes no sense.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:19.007 --> 0:38:19.328]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:41.232 --> 0:38:42.059]: 
  I love this show.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:15.782 --> 0:40:17.031]: 
  This is a comment.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:35.661 --> 0:40:37.399]: 
  Let's just say, let's just say this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:04.264 --> 0:41:06.255]: 
  over. So like that or they cut away.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:18.659 --> 0:41:21.443]: 
  I think they probably be against it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:21.443 --> 0:41:21.797]: 
  Really nice.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:23.029 --> 0:41:23.687]: 
  I mean, you, I think

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:26.185 --> 0:41:30.522]: 
  No, I think even as an adult every time I know oh man

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:37.525 --> 0:41:40.039]: 
  It's almost like by PG-13 of...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:45.929 --> 0:41:52.425]: 
  Everyone's seen those gifts of people like dying and all that and maybe it could be desensitized or that shit so in real life

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:51.042 --> 0:41:51.413]: 
  So

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:52.257 --> 0:41:55.109]: 
  If I saw like someone bleeding profusely, I would- Hey, no, absolutely.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:54.147 --> 0:42:30.445]: 
  No, absolutely, and at this age kids know like kids see stuff on the internet They're desensitized before their parents even figure out what the internet is. That's just what it is It's like that's fact when I was young my parents my mom I'm not a double-hook amounts and my dad couldn't even figure out how to check the internet history But but I was already looking at the most fucked up stuff and they don't have no idea Yeah, but even with that though like even with like I love horror But I was and I see a lot of creepy shit, but you know, it's fake Yeah, but when I see like an ISIS video where there's something I don't want to see that That shit still gives me nightmares like that and it doesn't matter how many fucking

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:01.437 --> 0:42:01.825]: 
  That's just...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:09.435 --> 0:42:11.157]: 
  But for me, I was already leaving.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:12.996 --> 0:42:14.295]: 
  They had no idea.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:17.164 --> 0:42:18.447]: 
  But I was- And I see a lot of-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:18.447 --> 0:42:18.514]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:22.311 --> 0:42:24.100]: 
  I don't want to see that. I don't want to see that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:25.686 --> 0:42:26.665]: 
  Absolutely.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:28.049 --> 0:42:29.820]: 
  I've never fucking bore things I've seen in my life.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:30.445 --> 0:42:32.504]: 
  So high production that it looks like a movie that it's

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:32.504 --> 0:42:33.735]: 
  The one I saw

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:32.909 --> 0:45:21.017]: 
  The one I saw, I haven't seen the newer ones. When I was in Polynesia in 2005, somebody showed me a video on their cell phone. I didn't even know. The Russian soldier? I didn't even know what it was. It was the one where the guy was lying on the ground and they put this tiny little knife on his throat and they held his head down on its side and the guy was stepping on it. That's the one, that was on everyone's cell phone. In 2005, right? Animal cruelty. And I didn't even know what this video was and as soon as it started happening, I thought it was fake at first and then as soon as I realized it was real, I was just like, oh my, that imagery lived with me for so fucking long. And again, you know, it's like, we talk about, oh well, people are gonna be desensitized. I think that yes, some people, you can be kind of desensitized to certain things, but that doesn't mean you can desensitize people out of feeling stuff, you know what I mean? Like when something's real, I think there is a distinct difference. I agree completely and I really do feel like, and I guess I'll kind of close it out with this, but I feel like I'm glad that a movie has finally come and been like, hey, we can do this. And it's like, okay, well then we can do it. And it's like maybe now we can break the hinges down. I'm not saying like go fucking like Star Wars and start cutting people's heads off and boardfly everywhere. They're standards, man. It's like, you know. Dude, oh man, you made me wish Star Wars had more. But for years, Star Wars, like when they cut off a limb, the fucking lightsaber actually sawed us. Dude, the massive heat. Cutting someone's head down the middle. No, listen, the lightsaber actually cauterizes so you couldn't bleed because it's so fucking hot that the skin just melts to your body. So when people are stabbed in Star Wars and fall over, it's genius because it's already like molten hot fucking shit going through your skin. You're not gonna have any blood. But they never like cut someone's head down the middle. Yeah, yeah. But that's a standard. That's a standard. Someone threw the face and then you can do like an evil dead view of the camera like through the hole in their head. I would love that. That's also what I'm saying. Movies like Avengers, Star Wars, these movies should be PG-13. Yes, you should get kids. But movies like Deadpool, Spawn, Punisher, these movies should be rated R. Zombie movies should be rated R. These movies should be fucking rated R. They should not be pusified. And that's what I'm curious. And that's what I feel like. Okay, so I wanna take one step further and just ask, do you think then by that frame of thinking that it's even possible to have a rated R cartoon? Is it even possible? Because- Isn't South Park rated R? Right, but we're talking, right, so at this point it's only rated R because of what, opinions and bad words? No, like nudity. Right, but what are we seeing? There's cartoon, it's cartoon gore cartoon nudity. The body isn't real. Right, so if it's so clearly not real. But it's still the same effect on kids' heads. It still gives the same perception. And a cartoon, if you cut someone's arm off and red stuff sprays everywhere, they assume it's blood.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:34.765 --> 0:42:36.081]: 
  What I'm using today to break the video off of that's been 對不對

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:38.089 --> 0:42:39.321]: 
  I didn't even know

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:47.894 --> 0:42:50.864]: 
  The guy was slipping on it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:50.864 --> 0:42:53.918]: 
  Like 2005 right animal cruel and I didn't even

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:40.307 --> 0:43:41.472]: 
  He went flying everywhere.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:42.484 --> 0:43:43.733]: 
  It's dangerous, man. It's like cool.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:44.982 --> 0:43:47.699]: 
  Dude, oh man, you may need more stars if more people are here.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:46.450 --> 0:43:47.007]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:14.436 --> 0:45:15.044]: 
  It's still...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:20.545 --> 0:45:22.604]: 
  See you to asshole

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:22.047 --> 0:46:30.272]: 
  But that's an asshole, but even South Park it was it's funny But do you remember the episode where like it's like something stupid where they were making fun of the happening where something was coming? And he's like who already kept like shooting himself in the head and it's like more parts of his face was being blown off and he was just like Just kept killing himself. Yeah, but he couldn't fucking die. So he just kept shooting himself and more pieces were flying off That was legitimately fucked up. Yeah, and there's a lot of parts where like, you know characters are melting and there's like a skinner falling And even then it's like it's fucking cool, but it's also like wow this fucked up and weird, but it's realistic That's what's so interesting cool. It's not real it did They're emulating a this is like a realistic thing you would see in a fucking if they did this in a Tarantino film Sure, you blasted this site of someone's fucking mouth Of course, yeah, like spitting bread, but they're not showing you see that they're not showing it to us No, we are translating little block paper block characters and they're fucking fake spraying blood Because of how they're doing it. They're making it so unbelievably uncanny. You're just like I can't help We're putting an R rating on the insinuation

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:45.773 --> 0:45:45.975]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:58.125 --> 0:45:59.492]: 
  Not real, it is real.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:09.246 --> 0:46:10.984]: 
  But they're not showing. You would see that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:12.385 --> 0:46:12.672]: 
  We

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:15.068 --> 0:46:16.047]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:19.894 --> 0:46:20.080]: 
  But

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:24.484 --> 0:46:26.779]: 
  I can't help but believe this is right now.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:24.501 --> 0:46:25.007]: 
  I can't have

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:29.277 --> 0:46:40.802]: 
  You guys are thinking of it so wrong. It's like they're not putting a rating on it to protect you from getting sick They're putting a rating on it for kids to be like I don't want to know what a butthole is or something You know what I mean? I don't know

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:40.802 --> 0:47:02.031]: 
  I understand that. Yeah, I'm thinking of it more for a general audience. When you see a movie, I'm just, again, an example, when you see a movie like Punisher, where all of his comics invoke him torturing and killing people, that should be rated at R. If Punisher came out and they followed the PG-13 thing, it would be horrible. He would like stab someone and they'd just be like, ah! And he'd be like, did you learn your lesson? I heard the story, wasn't it?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46 --> 0:46:42.389]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:44.447 --> 0:46:44.734]: 
  See you next time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:51.602 --> 0:46:52.497]: 
  That should be rated up.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:52.497 --> 0:46:53.695]: 
  Absolutely, absolutely.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:59.618 --> 0:47:05.440]: 
  I heard the story. Someone killed his wife and kids and he said, Yeah, I heard the story.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:03.634 --> 0:47:04.005]: 
  Ja.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:04.005 --> 0:47:05.997]: 
  Yeah, I heard the story and it was

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:04.815 --> 0:47:04.950]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:05.997 --> 0:47:16.442]: 
  compelling but I heard the movie was mass so I didn't want to watch it the company is almost a comedy in some point is a comedy is this is really good I don't watch it I'm watching it like this pop I got in the car I like this

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:08.393 --> 0:47:09.979]: 
  But I like the stories.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:08.950 --> 0:47]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:10.823 --> 0:47:13.354]: 
  It's a comedy. It's ridiculous.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:12.747 --> 0:47:13.894]: 
  I don't watch this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:15.312 --> 0:47:22.956]: 
  I like the story, but I don't like the idea of the movie being kind of shit So I want to wait and that's an example say we'll make them a good place

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:19.176 --> 0:47:22.129]: 
  So I just want to wait for it to do that. And that's an example. Of course, they will make them.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:22.889 --> 0:48:27.689]: 
  And that's my point. That's my point where it's like, these movies should be rated R. Not everything should be fucking rated R. When you stab someone and cut their limbs off, it's like that should not be rated R if it depends on the kind of moony. Like if you see something like Harry Potter, you're not, that's a family film. If you see some like Star Wars and stuff, again, I keep going back to that, but if they shoot someone or something that should not be rated R, because that to me is a family movie, but something that was designed, has the backlog, has been built up under this adult audience, and you should not talk down to your adult audience and you should give them the gratuitous violence that you have always given you. So that is the statement. So all of those things, I think that's very reasonable. I think that's very reasonable. If you know that you're gonna have a family audience, fine, makes perfect sense, make it a family movie, but if you're gonna go with your source material, that's clearly for adults, then don't try to fucking, you know, I think the problem is a lot of producers are like, oh wait, you know, it's like, there's this video game, there's this comic book, and adults quote unquote read these, but it's a comic, let's be honest. It's a comic kids, they read comics. It's like, you make the kids, you make the kid friendly version, right? Cause only kids really read comics. Oh, I see what you mean.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:38.768 --> 0:47:38.869]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:54.985 --> 0:47:55.474]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:26.693 --> 0:48:30.895]: 
  It's what you mean about the cartoons. It's people who cartoon right that's exactly

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:28.566 --> 0:51:38.022]: 
  People who write that's exactly so if we were gonna go with the comics then all of a sudden I'm thinking of the But I understand your point as far as like it's not so much like for me It's not a rating for me to judge. It's mostly a warning for kids So yeah, that's um that's pretty much First of all who sent you that yeah Shit I had a note all right, so if anybody doesn't know because you probably can't see what we're pointing at because I think I took a picture. Yeah, but Nick got a giant fucking sleepy cabin got it sleepy Oh, it's for us. Okay, so you brought in so I thought it was yours But sleepy cabin got a fucking giant gummy bear and let me just tell you something I have it's not a phobia, but I'm repulsed by giant fruit and chocolate things I think they're fucking disgusting giant fruit stupid and I think it's the most fucking retarded I think ever I think giant chocolate fucking Easter bunnies when your parents like here I got you this fucking thing you can't eat and it'll just melt and become useless Here's a four million pound sugary fucking jelly heavy.

No, no, it wasn't that that is another show But it was a bunch of guys It was a bunch of guys who kind of in the same vein as Jackass they rode around in different cities trying to beat world records That was a status fun show It was a show on MTV and I fucking loved it and I don't know if anybody knows it But the first one I watched the first episode was like this banana eating competition.

  Oh, there it goes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:44.541 --> 0:54:44.963]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:45.992 --> 0:54:51.392]: 
  You know what's like, guy who runs backwards the fastest or guy who runs with an egg on his head Yeah, but that's not what I meant

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:51.038 --> 0:55:46.658]: 
  Yeah, but the idea of somebody being like a group of like six guys who run around go around the world looking for records And then fucking beating them or failing them and whoever fails them It's like they're already like embarrassed from like trying to do it Yeah, so like someone who tries to eat the biggest burger they like fucking puke and they're like The guy who pulls a train with his fucking ears see they're gonna do practical stuff I pulled it with his dick. They're gonna do stuff like that's a real stuff They're gonna walk on their hands for a certain amount of time, but it was a really good show And I don't remember what it was called, but it was fucking fantastic because I've always been obsessed with like world records I because I'm a fan of like when I speed runs. I love speed runs. I love world record But like I love the idea of people Competing to do this one crazy thing that you could not imagine like who walk on their hand for like 82 hours I'm gonna ask you unbelievable speed run.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:13.446 --> 0:57:14.931]: 
  Alright guys, talk to you later.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:14.931 --> 0:57:40.024]: 
  We've talked to them in pairs. We've talked to the mucus. We've got some questions from our patrons. We'd like to hit up. That's going to be fun time. Bing, bing, bong, bing. Patreon questions. All right, boys and girls, we got a question from Connor Gerard here. A question for all members. Has somebody ever done something so irritating or offensive to you that you have completely stopped communicating with that person or vice versa?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:39.957 --> 0:57:49.322]: 
  Someone just kept calling me and I just hated it. It wouldn't stop calling me on my phone like 40 times a day. Something offensive, no. It was annoying. That was the only time I stopped talking to someone was when they just did that. I was like, ooh, there's real.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:44.074 --> 0:57:46.167]: 
  Something offensive, no.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:48.867 --> 0:58:19.832]: 
  There's really not something that offensive people can do. I think the most, it's not so much that it's offensive, but I get kind of tired of like, I give somebody attention that I enjoy, then they just shower me with attention and the kind of attention I don't want. And I'm just like, okay, well, this kind of sucks. Cause I kind of gave you the benefit of the doubt. And I realized now that I kind of just open the floodgates. No. I guess if that's an example. Yeah. I had a college friend. I'm not gonna lay names down. I had a college friend. Yeah, I would try not to name people. I had a college friend. And recently I connected with them on Twitter.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:57.642 --> 0:57:57.929]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:08.745 --> 0:58:08.982]: 
  Merci beaucoup

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:09.724 --> 0:58:09.809]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:11.631 --> 0:58:12.120]: 
  Ja.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:12.002 --> 0:58:14.044]: 
  I had cold sweat. I'm not gonna lay names down there.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:19.832 --> 0:58:22.937]: 
  and we started talking more. It was great. It was great to catch up and

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:22.937 --> 0:59:46.941]: 
  you know, see how this person was doing. But the way their life went since college was very different from the way my life went. And they're very, I don't wanna call it social justice, but that's kind of like really demeaning only and that is like throwing off what they are. Like, oh, you're just a social justice. They feel very strongly about certain, yeah, yeah, sex-based issues, like gender-based issues. And they said a few things and they took a few of the things I said out of context and we would explain it, right? So over Twitter, it'd be like, I say something, they get offended, I explain it, we're all good. That's all we know, Twitter? We did, but now we're all good. But then all the other people who are coming late to the conversation all just start thrashing this person and going as far as they can out of their way to just fuck them, make a point, you know what I mean? And eventually this person was just like, these are the people you, you know what I mean? Like, these are the people that surround you or whatever. I don't wanna be a part of this. So they basically, these are the type of people that if they see an opposing opinion, like political opinion on Facebook, they'll like, de-friend you. I mean, they're not really friends, you know what I mean? So those people, it's like, let them de-friend you because then you get more and you know who you are. Yeah, that's probably a good sign when they're that petty with that person. And then as far, yeah, I mean, as far as me stopping communication, I don't need to name names, but I had this one friend that I married for seven years and they fucked my neighbor for two years so that I stopped talking to them. You're mad, you're mad. There's the, yeah, there's divorced kids out there who have to pay for this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:52.890 --> 0:58:53.582]: 
  We're all good.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:20.852 --> 0:59:24.025]: 
  I mean they're not really friends, you know what I mean? So those videos are like, let's go.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:24.666 --> 0:59:25.594]: 
  Because there you decides what's at it's得

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:28.429 --> 0:59:28.851]: 
 c

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:39.297 --> 0:59:43.448]: 
  years so I stopped talking to them.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:46.941 --> 0:59:49.439]: 
  What are they? They're existing?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:48.848 --> 0:59:52.274]: 
  Your existence is too......to be divorced.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59 --> 0:59:56.999]: 
  their existence is doing to be divorced. And they can't deal with this kind of real estate. Like before social war,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:53.134 --> 0:59:55.345]: 
  I can't deal with this kind of realism.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:56.999 --> 1:00:25.905]: 
  or social justice warriors existed. There was one in my high school class and she was like that huge feminist figure, you know that like she tried to organize everything and she just, oh god. And anyway, I found her on Twitter recently. So I followed her just to see that she hated me by the way because I had the complete opposite opinions of her. And just to kind of rub it in, I followed her. So she'd be like, nah, I followed you and I'd have more. I don't know, that was the one petty thing I've ever done. Oh my god. Wow, you're a little bitch.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:24.353 --> 1:00:51.015]: 
  Oh my god. You're a little bitch. You're using your father's fountain. You are a little bitch. You are a little bitch. It smells so good. Yeah, look at me. You know what? This goes great with the next question. Jose Zerate asks, if you could change the sex of one of the sleepy cast members, who would it be and what would you have sex with them? I changed now and I have sex with them. So that's how he goes into the next question. Well, I called you a little bitch. Okay. I say next question. I wonder.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:27.542 --> 1:00:31.592]: 
  You are a little old people. Look at me. Hey, you know what?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:43.506 --> 1:00:46.290]: 
  So that's how he goes to be like...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:50.205 --> 1:00:53.378]: 
  I wonder, okay, look in reality, I wonder what's actually...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:53.378 --> 1:01:09.494]: 
  would look like as a girl.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:54.222 --> 1:00:55.217]: 
  ah ah ah

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:58.154 --> 1:00:58.710]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:58.440 --> 1:00:58.694]: 
  Bye!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:59.892 --> 1:01:00.449]: 
  Why?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:05.174 --> 1:01:05.595]: 
  Nej mind office

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:09.494 --> 1:01:14.219]: 
  No, my real answer would be um My real answer would probably be You're self and you fuck yourself

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:14.219 --> 1:01:21.998]: 
  Maybe. Because I feel less weird about that. You turned it in for some reason. You did like doll up your hand. I just wanted to incorporate Zach into this pocket.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:16.412 --> 1:01:18.555]: 
  You turn it for some reason.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:21.998 --> 1:01:26.470]: 
  By the way, people are asking where the fuck is that? People are asking He's still part of Sleepy Cabin by the way

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:23.652 --> 1:01:25.609]: 
  He's still part of Sleepy Cabin.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:24.495 --> 1:01:25.727]: 
  He's still part of Sleepy Cabinbar.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:26.470 --> 1:01:27.449]: 
  We just...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:27.449 --> 1:01:44.189]: 
  It's cold, we can't get to New York. Oh yeah, it's very simple. You know, we could explain it the best we could, but it's pretty simple. It's 16 below outside in Zach Lips and fucking New York. And he only, it's for work, it's very, very simple. The only way we can do a podcast is if we do it in person. We're not writing anything.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:28.596 --> 1:01:28.680]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:28.680 --> 1:01:29.440]: 
  Oh yeah, it's it's

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:30.942]: 
  It's very simple.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:39.599 --> 1:01:41.809]: 
  There you go. It's very, very simple.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:43.311 --> 1:01:49.521]: 
  We're not writing anything. We're not doing like Zach, you know, in sleepy cabin. Guys, living in New York right now. No. Hard to guess.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:45.184 --> 1:03:36.137]: 
  Zach, it's sleepy cabin. I'm living in New York right now. No, hard to guess who. Yes, the fans want to know where he is. We all want him on the podcast. I would love to. We're still talking to him on Skype. He knows, we just got to get up to get to him. Look, if anyone wants to fucking complain about how we haven't gotten him on, guess what? He could have fucking come down here any day of the motherfucking week, and we could have recorded with him too. I mean, he will, he will come down. Yeah, and he'll come down probably the exact same reason we haven't gotten up. It's fucking cold, we're fucking busy. It is actually like searing, face melting pain. Next question. All right, so there's one. Chris Moore asks, do you guys have any good stories from social high school events, especially prom or other dances? What are your thoughts on them? Oh, I can tell you my prom experience. Yeah. I went with a girl who was obsessed with me, but I didn't like her remotely. I like it all. I liked her as a friend, and we went to prom, and she was like really excited about prom. I was just going because I wanted to be nice. And the whole night, she was like grinding on my dick and doing like, she was doing suggestive stuff. But the problem is, it's like the equivalence of a girl, it's like equivalence of a fucking obese whale of a woman that you are interested in. Yeah, no, I'm speaking in a sense where it's like someone who doesn't take care of herself. She's gross, and she thinks highly about herself, but you don't like her at all. He's not like Donald Trump right now. She's gross, she's disgusting, and I... Okay, fine, let me reword that. It's the equivalence of a fucking disgusting homeless man, old guy coming up to you, rubbing his fucking dirty dick all over your leg, being like, doing that to you. Okay, if you don't like the fat whale stinky part, then how about the dirty homeless man? Everybody can fucking relate to the dirty homeless man in New York. So that was the equivalence. She was rubbing her fucking dirty homeless dick all over me the whole night, and I was just pissed.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:55.444 --> 1:01:56.001]: 
  to get up to get

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:04.810 --> 1:02:06.042]: 
  And he will, he will come down.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:09.670 --> 1:02:13.450]: 
  It's fucking cold. We're fucking busy. It is, it is.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:13.450 --> 1:02:14.378]: 
  I actually like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:32.755 --> 1:02:33.531]: 
  I like it all.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:43.859 --> 1:02:45.462]: 
  Oh wow, she was doing...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:53.072 --> 1:02:54.996]: 
  A whale of a woman that you are interested in.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:15.685 --> 1:03:16.005]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:16.005 --> 1:03:16.461]: 
  Thank you very much.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:19.920 --> 1:03:21.102]: 
  That's you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:34.484 --> 1:03:38.162]: 
  All night and I was just pissed. Was she like slim and attractive?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:37.994 --> 1:05:18.720]: 
  She was okay, but the plot, but the thing, I didn't like her. If you don't like somebody, you, if you don't- But Gory, you're a guy. I know. And if it's a girl, obviously it doesn't matter what they look like. No, that's- It's obviously, you want to have sex all the time. It's true. You want to rape her. Believe it, believe it or not. All the time. Ripley's believe it or not. Sometimes guys have tastes in things that walk and move. I don't always want to fuck everything. In the Guinness Book of World Records, men are the number one rapists. Okay? It's true. It's true. 100% of men are rapes. Are you saying you were uncomfortable by a woman being herself? Maybe that's because your misogyny- I'll be honest. Honestly, it was like being sexually harassed. There's nothing you can do. Women can't sexually harass men because they don't have the power. But it was basically like, by the end of the night, I told her, and what pissed me off was, I told her at the beginning, I'm like, hey, we can dance. We can do this stuff. But I'm not doing any dirty dancing to the fucking, move it to the ride. Six steps this time. You don't wanna dance in a song? We're not in fucking dancing in that song. I'm like, if you start, I told her, I'm like, if you start fucking air ass grinding against me, I'm gonna have a few words to say afterwards. She's like, okay, okay. And then, first of all, the punk was the fucking- You're gonna sign the contract? The punch wasn't spiked. So there's no reason why she was dancing, like she was fucking wasted. She was all over me. By the end of the night, I told her, I'm like, we're friends, we're in a band, but I have no interest in you, okay? It's like, I like that you play band, but you like math and other boring shit, and I don't care. That's what fucked up says. You let math get your ass out of my face. This is basically what she was like, she was a mathematician and she would tell me math problems and I'd be like, and?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:43.579 --> 1:03:44.204]: 
  6

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:44.997 --> 1:03:45.149]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:51.443 --> 1:03:54.379]: 
  Obviously, you want to have sex all the time.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:55.864 --> 1:03:56.016]: 
  Thanks for watching. Be sure to subscribe.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:08.419 --> 1:04:12.942]: 
  Okay? It's true. It's true. It's 100% of men are we... Are you saying you were...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:12.942 --> 1:04:13.482]: 
  uncomfortable

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:18.072 --> 1:04:18.780]: 
  I'll be honest.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:24.906 --> 1:04:25.176]: 
  but it

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:36.330 --> 1:04:37.950]: 
  Das ist freaking

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:37.950 --> 1:04:39.503]: 
  We're not fucking dancing in that.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:39.503 --> 1:04:40.178]: 
  I'm like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:49.679 --> 1:04:50.674]: 
  Sign the contract.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:09.557 --> 1:05:12.949]: 
  That's what fucked up you let math get your ass out of my face.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:18.704 --> 1:05:22.298]: 
  Listen Einstein, I'm at down for these fucking sticky hobo pussy dans.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:20.948 --> 1:06:37.949]: 
  So she she wasn't everything I wasn't into basically the only thing we connected on was band stuff I know it sounds fucked up to be this direct and blunt It really got to the point where we were laying in the car and she kept trying to Suck my dick in the car. Why were you laying in the car with somebody? They're gonna want to do something for laying in the car with them where I was in a car I wasn't laying I was like kind of spread and you know, I was just like waiting to get home You know, I have my hand on my face. I was like this fucking night She was still trying to come at it and what's funny is after I told her off because I told her off after that the next time She was a complete contimate band practice. She was mean. She was fucking Aggressive and I and it was just like what are you fucking eight? It's like can you not realize that I have no interest in you. Did you not tell that I don't like advances? It's like but that that was my promise I spent a hundred and fifty dollars on a fucking Tex and got Basically molested by a girl. I didn't really like I was talking to some people about prom not so long ago in a chat It's interesting how much pressure people put on like prom like even Hollywood, right? So like every Hollywood movie about high school It's always about prom prom prom prom and even the kids who are like too cool for prom end up going to prom somehow And I remember going as well, but

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:29.892 --> 1:05:30.044]: 
  It's

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:40.489 --> 1:05:40.506]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:40.506 --> 1:05:42.869]: 
  leg I was kind of like kind of spread and you know I

  practice.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:57.550 --> 1:05:59.575]: 
  be passive aggressive and I

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:29.984 --> 1:06:30.254]: 
  This is April Smith of Taco Bell. Thank you very much for that. Thank you guys for being here today. Thank you guys very much. I think today is April the 22nd of April. And just a quick reminder, April is a no 28th of April this week. Of April, my During 30 days inЛandil, I've had two приходs that I wanted to move to a new level. I was showing my self leaners up in a little prickly archiv武uts on the security level

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:37.949 --> 1:06:39.265]: 
  Too cool for prom

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:39.029 --> 1:08:07.487]: 
  Well, I definitely didn't see the big deal. Like I didn't care as much, you know, because there was so much pressure. But in retrospect, like I never think of the prom day. Like that memory, I have so many memories of friends, so many memories of going out to restaurants or walking on train tracks or being in the woods or doing stupid shit or even playing a game with people on the stream or playing a board game when I was a kid. I don't know, just stupid shit, right? Fights you got in. But this prom thing that was so built up is one of the least memorable experiences of my fucking life. Like I never caught myself sitting there just ruminating. I mean, besides like right now or like when it comes up. Yeah, some people, some people meet their like true love it proms and it's like a fucking matchbook heaven thing. But it's like, it's different for everybody. It's true. Some people are gonna have really memorable times, but you ever watched those movies, right? About prom. There's a prom king or queen. There's a couple of losers that end up not being losers. Like they're actually cool or whatever and their friends now or they're dancing. And then there's like 300 other extras that are on the dance floor that you never hear about or see, right? That to me is 99.999% of people. They were just people at a dance who happened to fucking be on the dance floor. And that was it. They didn't get a main storyline. They didn't get a side storyline. That was it. And they went home and like you could have had a more memorable experience sitting right here and watching Corey play a fucking video game.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:18.297 --> 1:07:19.950]: 
  I was so bad at doing this.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:19.950 --> 1:07:20.845]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:02.779 --> 1:08:03.825]: 
  I've been pretty good sitting right here.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:07.437 --> 1:08]: 
  I have a pretty good prom story actually, nah I think about it. In Ireland it's not called a prom, it's called The Debs. And before The Debs there's another one that's called The Grads. And in The Grads I didn't really know many girls back then.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08 --> 1:08:27.703]: 
  I was just bad with them and so someone's hooked me up with their friend for that And then that person threw me under the bus started making fun of me in front of the girl and then the girl started making fun of me I just got like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:27.703 --> 1:08:30.657]: 
  Like, bullied by my grads date.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:30.657 --> 1:08:40.444]: 
  But anyway, that's aside from the po- I didn't really care, I let him do his thing. But, uh, I went- that summer I went to, uh, Greece. And, uh, I was talking to this guy who recently broke up with his girlfriend.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:40.444 --> 1:08:45.456]: 
  friend uh call him Jack because his name is Jack and uh we both got really drunk

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:44.189 --> 1:08:50.772]: 
  We both got really drunk. Call him Jack, because it's been Jack. We got really drunk. Some games work. He was telling me how much he loved me.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:48.948 --> 1:08:56.999]: 
  He was telling me how much he loved this girl and all that. And he was just pouring his heart. I kept buying him sex on the beaches, those drinks. Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:56.442 --> 1:09:00.492]: 
  Yes, and we just got fucking hammered and he was just telling me how much he loved her. He started kind of

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:00.492 --> 1:09:02.500]: 
  kinda like tearing up at the end and then like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:01.504 --> 1:09:10.448]: 
  the end and then like a couple weeks later was my prom and I didn't really know many girls and the person who someone hooked me up with ended up being his ex girlfriend.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:10.448 --> 1:09:11.005]: 
  And then he's like,

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:11.005 --> 1:09]: 
  He was going with some other...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09 --> 1:09:13.941]: 
  So he saw you with her.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:13.924 --> 1:09:18.345]: 
  Yeah, but instead of doing the dirt, I started kind of playing him up to her.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:18.345 --> 1:09:36.942]: 
  whole night and then she was like yeah yeah yeah yeah and then and then I think like they hooked up by the end of it yeah so I don't really get anyone that night but you're the good guy good guy now I was happy to see those two kind of kind of rekindle I don't know how they're doing right now they could be together it could not be but that's still a storyline it was good I mean your story

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:23.897 --> 1:09:29.247]: 
  About the end of it? Yeah, so I didn't really get anyone that night. But you were the good guy. Good guy now. I was happy.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:30.850 --> 1:09:31.524]: 
  We kind of like it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:34.630 --> 1:09:47.725]: 
  That's still a storyline. It was good. I mean, your storyline ends with like a pan of you looking at the moon, you know, and then it pans up to the moon. I did good today, and then you fucking... No, I hooked up with another staffer. You jerk off seriously in the bathroom, because you had like the worst room in the world.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:36.942 --> 1:09:36.959]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:38.645 --> 1:09:41.649]:

  They fucking cooked it

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:48.939 --> 1:12:54.413]: 
  There was a dance that it wasn't prom but there was a dance when I first moved back from Japan to Seattle And it was it was in a town south. I think it was in like a renting I can't remember anyways there was a girl I met through a friend and so I went down to this dance We were sitting on the couch and we were drinking aftershock. You know aftershock is it's like a cinnamon Yeah, I drink it has like these crystals at the bottom Yeah, I got really really drunk the girls are getting ready the guys are hanging out. I've never met any of these people I only knew the girl just kind of and it was like a dance where the girls asked the guys out or something like that And so we're sitting there and a guy comes in not dressed for a dance at all comes up the stairs We're all on the couch. He's like get up. We get up He fucking moves the cushions and he pulls a fucking gun out from the fucking couch What fucking takes out the clip looks at it puts it back in puts it behind like his his pants and then leaves I was like, oh, this is this is a great part of town can't can't wait to go to this party That's where I am now so before we even got to the dance I had pretty much drank a lot of them I mean you guys know me when I drink I drink a lot Yeah, I drink very very fast and especially in this scenario I think I was just uncomfortable because I didn't know any of these people So I probably felt like I needed to compensate by drinking as much as I possibly could anyways I was so fucking plowed. I blacked out before we even got to the dance. We get to the dance We are it's in like the gym part of the the school And all I remember is as soon as we got in not like two minutes later I need to go to the bathroom and then I just remember staring into a toilet and puking a lot And then I remember some angry people pulling me up and dragging me out I guess in retrospect I think it was a couple of teachers, but I guess I was loud enough puking in the bathroom because the bathroom was part of the Gym like it was like right off the side of the gym So there's this dance going on and then there's this guy just puking and me not being a part of that school I guess was an even bigger problem. Yeah, so these teachers just didn't want me to be there So they just grabbed me. I just remember being picked up I remember out being outside sitting on the steps blacking out again, and then I was in a bed In this house. Yeah in this in yeah in this house that I did not even know and When I woke up she was gone. She had left so I don't know if she came back with me or not But she was gone my date and I didn't know anyone at this house and I got up There's like a couple people sleeping on the couch, you know, whatever and I just kind of crept out of the house I walk out it's like fucking like four in the morning or five in the morning It was in the summer So, you know, you can still kind of see the light and it was just like it was just such a creepy thing like I survived a fucking Car crash or something. I just felt like stranded on another planet because it was like I'm like hungover I have no idea where I am. I didn't have a cell phone back then, you know, and I'm in the neighborhood I have no idea where it is. There's no Uber. There's no Yeah, no, I ended up being able to find because we were when we first moved there We were staying in like a an extended stay hotel type place So I was able to eventually call that place and they have my mom come pick me up Yeah, well, this is high school, you know, but still I was just I didn't have a car at the time, you know, because we had just moved back

Earwig asks, Kellogg's, the creators of Kellogg's, Corn Flakes, and other famous popular serials, has hired each of you to come up with a new serial. However, the member who comes up with the worst serial gets his balls chopped off. So what are your ideas? Obviously, we don't give a fuck about the last one, mine got chopped off long ago. Mine.
