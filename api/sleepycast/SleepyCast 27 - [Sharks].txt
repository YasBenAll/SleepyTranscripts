 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:00.497 --> 0:00:20.494]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense. A world enveloped by a seemingly unending ocean of forests. Buried deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little cabin. And in that cabin, it's a little bit like a little cabin.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:20.494 --> 0:00:42.449]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:24.315 --> 0:02:13.084]: 
  I think it's important to note that this is the real Shadman. I think there's a lot of people who because of all of the Conspiracies and the mystery that veils the Shadman name some people may think that you may not be the real Shadman It's somebody could just be I've given up that voice of timidity because of you guys because like it's just been difficult trying to avoid Like my voice being on anything like what you stream or something. Yeah, exactly streaming like pretty regular. Yeah Yeah, at least this month you probably streamed about two times maybe yeah Even despite the streams despite the fact that they've heard you on your streams and even on some of like the game streams I did or like whatever. I still got a tweet asking about whether or not you were a girl I still get keep people asking that they think you're this hot like 16 year old No, you look like a hot

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:36.752 --> 0:01:37.984]: 
  Somebody could just be

  we

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:43.890 --> 0:01:49.544]: 
  My voice is being on anything. Like when you stream or something. Yeah, exactly. And you've actually been streaming pretty regularly. Yeah. At least.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:52.547 --> 0:01:54.201]: 
  Yeah, but even the sp-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:07.801 --> 0:02:09.439]: 
  He is, as you can see.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:02:09.439 --> 0:02:16.206]: 
  No, you look like a hot six year old girl, but you're not one. You can see his double B titties right about you. It's in the joke because...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:10.317 --> 0:02:10.991]: 
  You look like a-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:14.265 --> 0:02:47.003]: 
  It's a joke because like in the whole like kind of hentai scene and stuff a lot of artists who are girls like they just Completely abuse that like just post pictures of Do they? Yeah, these girls show off. Yeah, they show off They draw themselves so they and they draw themselves or they show photos of themselves They draw themselves as their original characters, but in real life. They're like these like autistic like Fuck off your cunts like A guy and I can be a guy in an entire right you can't

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:23.478 --> 0:02:24.492]: 
  Just post pictures of...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:24.492 --> 0:02:29.436]: 
  Oh, yeah, I get it. I'm a girl. Yeah. Just do that. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:29.436 --> 0:02:33.503]: 
  Like they draw themselves or they show photos of themselves

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:33.503 --> 0:02:35.275]: 
  Both.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:41.299 --> 0:02:42.852]: 
  Im Kan inability cover

 SPEAKER_04 [0:02:45.569 --> 0:03:05.076]: 
  I do feel like guy, girl, artist who draw themselves a lot. I honestly can't remember the last time I had to draw myself unless it was for like something, like a picture or something. I know exactly what you're talking about. How many times have you drawn yourself? I don't like drawing myself. How often do you think you do it though?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:59.339 --> 0:03:01.060]: 
  I know exactly what you're talking about. Well, help with the help.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:02.849 --> 0:03:04.637]: 
  I don't like drawing myself. How long did you think you'd do it?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:04.637 --> 0:03:06.645]: 
  though.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:06.089 --> 0:03:17.564]: 
  Exactly, that's weird to me that there's that big difference. That's not bad for this again. Because when I draw myself, I usually keep the key factors like the heavy weight, the flare face, the dance and the hair.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:03:06.257 --> 0:03:08.485]: 
  Exactly. It is weird to me that there is a big difference.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:07.506 --> 0:03:09.008]: 
  There's a big difference.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:03:12.467 --> 0:03:13.328]: 
  Cause there's also this

 SPEAKER_04 [0:03:14.560 --> 0:03:31.739]: 
  Yeah, that's what I think. There's a weird thing where it's like, either I make myself super unattractive and I really mean to myself that people draw me like that forever and I feel worse about myself. Or I just draw myself right down the middle, like, not attractive, but not bad looking, but people are like... You kind of Disney yourself? Yeah, exactly, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:28.853 --> 0:03:34.454]: 
  You kind of Disney yourself? Yeah, exactly, yeah. Like if you're a big fat guy, you just draw kind of a bloated guy? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:03:33.460 --> 0:03:41.290]: 
  Yeah, yeah, but then people see you they're like oh because you know there are those are inside there are some My favorite? Excuse me but they're like big whales

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:37.543 --> 0:03:55.448]: 
  I'm sorry, my favorite part is when you know someone that's like 300 pounds over weight and they draw themselves, it's like an action hero that has a little bit of a baby gun. Yeah, it's a guy with a little bit of a gun. But when you see him in real life, you can see his skinny face hiding in his fat. You ever see that? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:03:44.985 --> 0:03:45.542]: 
  Wait.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:55.448 --> 0:04:01.506]: 
  You ever know he's gonna take a fat guy and rip his fat off? Like, oh, you're a human. Goodness gracious.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:59.228 --> 0:04:09.825]: 
  When I see a fat, I'm saying, but you see, that's the kind of, that's like the neglectful fat, where you can like see the skinny person behind the fat. I'm kinda having a real shit. This is like the meanest thing you've ever said. And you notice it up.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:05.894 --> 0:04:12.492]: 
  I'm gonna be having a real shit show. This is like the meanest thing you've ever said. And you posted it off like it was nothing.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:12.492 --> 0:04:16.339]: 
  The year he gets skinny and he says that

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:16.339 --> 0:04:22.499]: 
  That used to be like kind of normal like averages, but now that you're skinny you feel that fatty should all be put down, huh? Look look look

 SPEAKER_04 [0:04:21.603 --> 0:04:29.991]: 
  Look, you know what it was a fatty. This is a bad fatty. This is a fatty. Go walk to your death. No, I'm saying, I'm saying if you're like that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:27.325 --> 0:04:32.455]: 
  I'm saying if you're like that wreck

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:29.991 --> 0:04:41.449]: 
  That wreck. So to say, if you're big or obese, then don't draw yourself as this eight-pack wearing like strong eye. Actually draw yourself.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:39.728 --> 0:04:57.615]: 
  Actually draw this out honest. Be honest. I think this is a good tip through life. If you understand yourself completely, if you like, if you're way cruder to yourself and expect the worst, if you're kind of fat, you're like, I want to draw myself like a big obese fucking slug as a man. Just a mountain of a hat. Yeah, then there's only going up from there. If you start at the bottom of the barrel, there's only going up.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:04:41.449 --> 0:04:42.529]: 
  He's already esper

 SPEAKER_04 [0:04:51.675 --> 0:04:55.388]: 
  mountain of it. Yeah, then the people, then there's only going up there.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:55.388 --> 0:05:16.380]: 
  I think for the most part whenever we draw ourselves for the most part I feel like we draw ourselves Extremely grotesque like if we do it because it's accurate. Yeah It's really nice with like really Faces I'm drawing myself with strict details of all the nasty zits I grew that day. I'm like, yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:01.497 --> 0:05:01.767]: 
  If

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:02.374 --> 0:05:04.450]: 
  Because it's accurate. It's true.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:03.302 --> 0:05:03.522]: 
  true.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:04.450 --> 0:05:06.424]: 
  It's really hideous, especially you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:06.424 --> 0:05:11.301]: 
  I thought it was really nice with like really good cut faces. I'm drawing myself with the strictest...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:14.018 --> 0:05:17.494]: 
  Yeah, people know their own flaws the best

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:17.494 --> 0:05:22.574]: 
  That's true. Have you seen Chris's drawing of himself when he gets out of the shower?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:18.203 --> 0:05:19.418]: 
  That's true.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:18.507 --> 0:05:19.283]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:24.953 --> 0:05:25.594]: 
  Ew.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:27.248 --> 0:05:34.943]: 
  He's like big Negro lips. Just so you know, Shad's allowed to say that. He has a pass.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:34.943 --> 0:05:44.899]: 
  use Afro-American folks.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:05:36.175 --> 0:05:38.807]: 
  Yeah. If you're... by the way... You're barely... you're barely...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:05:39.516 --> 0:05:39.938]: 
  no

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:40.005 --> 0:05:41.507]: 
  You're really

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:43.330 --> 0:05:48.561]: 
  Chad was born in the heart of Africa. Can I say, by the way, I love that word. I came over on a banana boat.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:45.524 --> 0:05:47.414]: 
  Can I say, by the way, I love... I came all the way...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:49.152 --> 0:05:52.037]: 
  along with doggy kong and fucking barrel

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:50.805 --> 0:05:52.071]: 
  It's like a barrel.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:05:52.004 --> 0:05:59.715]: 
  Have you ever heard somebody use that word like really seriously, like ironically toward Negro in the year 2015? Yeah. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:58.619 --> 0:06:09.840]: 
  Yeah, yeah. We read an art story, and I saw a paint that was called Negro. That's the Spanish word you fucking... That's what I'm saying. So lots of people still say it, especially artists.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:06:00.610 --> 0:06:01.217]: 
  That's okay.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:02.652 --> 0:06:03.293]: 
  That's the...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:06:09.840 --> 0:06:15.696]: 
  There's a video I love of Ronald Reagan in the 80s where he was like, look at all you fight Negroes. I was like, whoa! There's a 19-year-old!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:14.650 --> 0:06:24.100]: 
  Whoa, you can't say that That's the thing that the same 1911 those they can say the Spanish word for black. What's the difference? I would say it's weird

 SPEAKER_04 [0:06:17.822 --> 0:06:17.873]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [0:06:20.269 --> 0:06:21.012]: 
  That was the key scene.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:06:23.037 --> 0:06:39.524]: 
  I would say it's weird apparently to my I heard this on a list of two I think I said on the podcast before but apparently the word black and negro switched the defense of this Yeah, so apparently the word black used to be more offensive really and it's only switched That's what I know maybe a retard you can correct me call me fucking idiot with a brain disorder

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:39.524 --> 0:06:42.949]: 
  Why people should be called pink people? Yeah. Here we are.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:42.105 --> 0:06:46.442]: 
  Yeah, or like, or like, or like, or like, just fucking kill these people.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:42.949 --> 0:06:44.991]: 
  or like, or like, or like,

 SPEAKER_04 [0:06:44.991 --> 0:06:49.935]: 
  Just fucking trash people. Just fucking trash people. Very fucking... You know, okay, so talking about... Hold on, talking about...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:47.909 --> 0:07:55.444]: 
  You know, okay, so talking about drawing yourself, like, you know, and now some people draw themselves and like flatter themselves. Yeah. In that vein, have you guys ever noticed like, look, I have no problem with the shape of your body or the look of your face. Everyone is wonderful and perfect in my eyes. Coming from the buff handsome guy. Shut up, I mean this, I mean this. Oh dude, what the fuck? But it does weird me out. When I see someone cosplay a character that is usually like, for example, if someone does like Aang from Avatar and they're like a 40 year old obese person, why are you dressed as Aang? Like, listen, there's one simple point where you just travel your body and you know that you look like a disgusting Aang but you're going out there to show off your fucking, what, your fucking water bending powers and you go up there, for a couple of people. Or the opposite, or the opposite. If there's like a big huge character and then some skinny ass motherfucker tries to play it. I mean, it's the idea that you're just taking one. It's just like the character. It's nothing to do with actually trying to look like any of these characters. Some people do that but like, I know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:49.935 --> 0:06:50.256]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:08.447 --> 0:07:11.299]: 
  I mean this, I mean this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:23.550 --> 0:07:26.706]: 
  What you're saying? And they're like a four year old obese person.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:30.047 --> 0:07:32.680]: 
  The funniest part is when you just travel your body.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:07:35.093 --> 0:07:36.949]: 
  You're going out there to show off your fucking...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:36.949 --> 0:07:37.185]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:48.036 --> 0:07:51.327]: 
  just

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:53.993 --> 0:07:56.963]: 
  people do that but like

 SPEAKER_04 [0:07:55.444 --> 0:08:08.505]: 
  And that was Chris and I spotted a guy who was no younger than 50 who was playing ass catch up And I was like not even close a big dumpy old man waddling like a goblin down the hall is nothing you know

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:06.160 --> 0:08:10.935]: 
  I saw Tricky like a ghoul

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:10.986 --> 0:08:18.698]: 
  I saw a pro black Goku cosplayer. He actually looked like Goku. He was pretty ripped too.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:08:15.441 --> 0:08:19.947]: 
  He actually looked like Goku. Yeah, he was pretty ripped too. Goku powered up to what you got.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:18.698 --> 0:08:22.680]: 
  Go compare it up to what you got Bert dude. Oh, that's what I'm saying.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:21.482 --> 0:08:26.444]: 
  No, that's what I'm saying. Like it looked like he spent a little too much time for a little something. I'm sorry it's all like.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:24.435 --> 0:08:26.933]: 
  I should have said that. I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:26.444 --> 0:08:29.160]: 
  No, they understand.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:27.861 --> 0:08:29.447]: 
  No, they understand.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:28.992 --> 0:08:34.695]: 
  No, we're talking about like different color people and stuff. Yeah, yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:29.144 --> 0:08:30.949]: 
  Get an exception bre

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:33.649 --> 0:08:45.192]: 
  Yeah, yeah, do you think it'd be easier if we just literally call people literally the exact color that they are no Cuz then do it for most points like black literally no racism. It's like look like look at that

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:38.155 --> 0:08:39.893]: 
  No. You're lucky.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:08:43.335 --> 0:08:49.512]: 
  Look like look at that. Is it is it weird though that we kind of stop the black and white? No, I'm saying that's like you never

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:48.263 --> 0:08:53.747]: 
  That's what I'm saying! You would never be like, oh yeah, the guy was yellow. You would never say that ever. Like that brownish yellow man ran that way.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:54.895 --> 0:08:58.017]: 
  That Swap Ast coin. That Swap Ast o-g子 blowing! Thank you, Mantis Plugman..

 SPEAKER_04 [0:08:56.481 --> 0:08:56.498]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:56.498 --> 0:08:57.257]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:58.017 --> 0:09:20.309]: 
  The problem is that some people are a bit color blind. They see different colors. They're like that red-green guy went that way. You'd be like, hey, yo, did you see that orange-brown guy? You're like, wait, you mean that tan bronze guy? No, no, no, no, no. He was kind of like, you know, brownish, kind of like a tree brown. Oh, wait, wait, wait. That's kind of like a reddish color. Yeah, it might be like.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:02.809 --> 0:09:04.446]: 
  That's yeah different color.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:02.944 --> 0:09:03.518]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:11.078 --> 0:09:12.951]: 
  We're cutting all the things in. No, no, no, no, no.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:09:16.495 --> 0:09:18.503]: 
  Wait, wait, wait. You mean like, this kind of like a reddish color?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:18.503 --> 0:09:23.937]: 
  Yeah, it might be easier to say.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:09 --> 0:09:21.709]: 
  You got trust

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:21.709 --> 0:09:46.634]: 
  And even if you broke people down into very specific color groups like Yellowish Orange, I guarantee what you'd really be doing is just creating more faclites of people. You wouldn't be creating like, yeah, there would be more racism. Because it would be like the Orange is Yellow people feel like they're being prejudiced against by the fucking Greenish Brown people.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:33.994 --> 0:09:36.306]: 
  You wouldn't be creating...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:09:45.891 --> 0:09:46.752]: 
  Yeah, yeah, the stuff.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:46.549 --> 0:09:50.380]: 
  The slightly whiter black guys will be feel

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:48.996 --> 0:09:56.455]: 
  It'll be like next level segregation. Yeah. Just giving them more ammo. More ammo. More ammo.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:09:51.764 --> 0:09:51.780]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:51.780 --> 0:09:52.607]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:53.569 --> 0:10:00.640]: 
  Look, we're gonna cause the race for you. More water fads. Between the doggies and the bees. It looks like 16- Okay, hold on.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:59.627 --> 0:10:10.950]: 
  Well okay hold on Chris what color would you be? Pink. You pink? Yeah, I don't know. See I don't even give you pink. No, I would be. Okay I'd be whiteish grayish pink. Okay yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:04.707 --> 0:10:06.023]: 
  Yeah, I don't know. See, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:05.449 --> 0:10:06.715]: 
  See, I don't even give you a paint.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:06.715 --> 0:10:08.436]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:11.352 --> 0:14:38.774]: 
  Yeah, you know what? Fuck all of our topics. Let's talk a little bit about what you're comfortable talking about in terms of your past. Just so people understand some of the stuff that has kind of been the basis of... I've been dehumanized a lot because of some of my practices I do online. Yeah. But we could go back a little and explain myself. Do you mind talking a little bit about your military experience?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:29.357 --> 0:14:29.729]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:40.073 --> 0:15:38.410]: 
  How about we kind of like rewind? Let's rewind, let's go back to the beginning. Let's go back to the beginning. Baby Shad is. We're going to do it. Not that far. Baby Shad is. At that far. The Shad link. Basically, I've never properly learned how to draw. So when I was younger and I've looked up into a bunch of graphic design stuff and I thought like, you know what would be really cool if I could make video games? Because I loved video games. Yeah. What genres would you want to be asking? Well, I especially loved first person shooters. But when you were a kid, when you were first playing? I loved like just like on the game boy, I played like all the... My first console was the PlayStation 2. I loved like Y City. I'm like, I just... When I discovered video games, I was just fascinated. Dude, yeah. The way Switzerland works with their universities and it's a college and university, they kind of split themselves by universities being more specified fields. For example, game design can be learned in a university there. Okay.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:42.925 --> 0:14:49.590]: 
  Let's go back to the beginning. Baby Shad is. We're gonna do Baby Shad is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:04.322 --> 0:15:05.065]: 
  Cause I love...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:15:06.077 --> 0:15:06.449]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:06.465 --> 0:15:06.685]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:12.287 --> 0:15:13.637]: 
  But when you were a kid, when you were first play?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:24.893 --> 0:15:25.450]: 
  तुवटिया

 SPEAKER_04 [0:15:37.802 --> 0:15:41.346]: 
  So college would be kind of for the average joke kind of guy kind of thing.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:41.346 --> 0:15:47.438]: 
  No, not really. I don't really... I'm not sure. I just know that that was a university. Okay, so...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:15:47.438 --> 0:15:50.374]: 
  When it comes to Switzerland's education...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:50.307 --> 0:17:05.451]: 
  The way Switzerland works is that if you are educated enough, you can do a test there. It's called a berufsmathura. When you have that, you can get into university and the state will pay for most of it. Oh, okay. Like a scholarship almost. Yeah, like they just pay for a lot. It's really cheap. And I didn't have that. I was completely undradicated, but sometimes they let people in when they think, I see potential in this guy and they let him in anyway. So I had this brilliant, I'm quoting, I don't know how to quote, you can't see it. But I had this idea, next to making my portfolio, I also have an online portfolio. So I made this website called ShabBase.com and I use it as my online portfolio. And I just put up some of my work I've done, some of my amateur digital paintings and stuff and some of the projects I've been working on. And I sent them in a portfolio, sending them off to my website. Yeah. They've looked into it and thought like, you know, we'll give you a chance. We usually don't do this, but we'll give you a chance. After summer, you can start. What does give you a chance mean? Like they give you like a...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:04.380 --> 0:16:05.494]: 
  Oh, okay. Like a scholar.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:05.494 --> 0:16:06.270]: 
  Zefért timeframe

 SPEAKER_04 [0:16:17.492 --> 0:16:19.247]: 
  and they let him in anyway.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:18.505 --> 0:16:18.960]: 
  the program is an important decision to make before the foundation of the school. t

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:23.972 --> 0:16:25.407]: 
  You know you can't see her.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:38.755 --> 0:16:39.295]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:52.390 --> 0:16:52.677]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:03.375 --> 0:17:08.775]: 
  mean like they give you like a it was it was like you know what this is a free time so I should call back to you know what's that we give a

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:06.176 --> 0:17:11.002]: 
  This is a fruity kind of dog shit. I'm actually a little sad. We have it for like a year. Like they don't even... No, no, no, they...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:17:07.442 --> 0:17:07.999]: 
  The conversation may be отк Hyungmin

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:09.872 --> 0:17:14.007]: 
  I think he needs to say like they were

 SPEAKER_04 [0:17:14.007 --> 0:17:16.977]: 
  You're the exception here. You're the real case. Yeah, I didn't have to educate you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:15.390 --> 0:17:23.388]: 
  Yeah, I didn't have the education you needed to get in there. So they actually said, we're taking a risk with you. Okay. Because I didn't have the education.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:17:21.297 --> 0:17:27.372]: 
  Okay, because it didn't have the education. So don't, so don't, you know, try to hunt. Yeah, I didn't have any diploma or anything. Okay.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:24.502 --> 0:18:07.517]: 
  Yeah, I didn't have any diplomas or anything. We're gonna take a risk with you and let you into the university. And I was ecstatic. I was so fucking happy. I thought like I'm actually gonna be something and learn. I can actually maybe realize my dream. I can make these video games I love. And I thought like I'm finally gonna be able to be swimming with sharks. But the thing about sharks is most people know they don't have a neck. So they don't look backwards. They're fast, vicious predators, deliberate. That's what people know. But what they don't know is that sharks, they get sad too.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:38.070 --> 0:17:39.252]: 
  something in there.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:44.635 --> 0:17:44.652]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:01.982 --> 0:18:03.434]: 
  That's what people know.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:18:08.378 --> 0:18:16.107]: 
  They cry, but you can't tell because they're under water. The ocean is a sea of shock to your renders and climate.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:09.930 --> 0:18:13.187]: 
  But she can't tell because they're under water.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:14.774 --> 0:18:26.114]: 
  It's invisible. And down there in the deep, it does get lonely. So, the sharks cry a lot, and that's why the ocean is salty. And anyways, get it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:18:24.477 --> 0:18:30.940]: 
  Anyways, got like a poet right here. It's poetry. So you left your shark cave to go exploring your city.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:24.814 --> 0:18:24.848]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:27.261 --> 0:19:27.623]: 
  here. So you left your shark cave to go exploring your fish. Anyway, the whole summer went by. I think I kind of got to know you through that. I started to get the courage to look deep inside like the darkest corners of myself. The corners where I never would have seen myself and I kind of explored those and like see that I have a friend in there. And I kind of explored that and like do some drawings which were very questionable morally. And I thought like, hey, I'll just upload them to this portfolio site I make. Make like an extra, you make like an extra category and start uploading a little more of a narrative stuff. And then I started there and like after summer I started there, like I started the classes we were going to learn off like just programming and game design and stuff. And

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:30.940 --> 0:18:30.974]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:37.470 --> 0:18:41.588]: 
  It's a core, yeah, you got to the core. But I started to like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:37.487 --> 0:18:37.504]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:49.165 --> 0:18:50.009]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:58.598 --> 0:18:58.919]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:05.145 --> 0:19:05.584]: 
  Mm-hmm.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:10.562 --> 0:19:11.457]: 
  Oh, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:15.254 --> 0:19:16.485]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:28.332 --> 0:20:04.950]: 
  I get like this weird email. Oh no. And it's like, can you meet us on Friday? Can you please meet us at this specific address? And I'm like, wait, this address isn't on campus ground. This is like somewhere in Zurich. Like, that's okay. What's fucking house? It's like in Zurich. It was like in Zurich, like some weird building. And I was like, OK. This fucking police station. I'll, I'm going to do that. And I thought, I thought to myself, hey, maybe this is something to do with every student. But it just. Oh, you thought it was part of the whole. Yeah. It's like a secret interview thing to see what you really want in there because it is a pretty big school. Part of you kind of like a little.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:42.642 --> 0:19:43.772]: 
  This one's fucking hell.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:47.080 --> 0:19:47.519]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:56.817 --> 0:19:57.930]: 
  Yeah, that's it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:20:03.010 --> 0:20:08.258]: 
  Part of you kind of like you have like little friend was probably like maybe it's because of this

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:07.262 --> 0:20:56.200]: 
  No, no, not at all. I was jokingly thinking of that. So you're like, ah, give me a laugh. That's the idea. That would be ridiculous. And the school weekend on Friday, I was like, I'm going to go there. I was waiting there and the professor approaches me and says, come with me. I'm going to lead you to the place. And I'm asking like, what is this about? I will tell you there. He didn't want to say anything about it. The professor was like this bald guy, had no hair and only glasses. Like, why those guys? I was like, okay. Look at this. He leads me into this building. We go up an elevator. Oh my god, dude. And we go into like this secluded room where there's these two really old geezers sitting there and another one of the professors.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:20:12.072 --> 0:20:14.367]: 
  No, so you're like, ah, I'll laugh that...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:14.367 --> 0:20:18.434]:

One of them was in the Justice Department. Oh my fucking god. They broke the bomb and said, we found some stuff on your website, which is highly illegal. And we cannot allow you back on the campus. Oh well. Because you're a menace to society. Really? You said that exactly. You're a menace to society. They made me sign a thing, accepting that I am. That you're a menace. You're a son of a bitch. You are officially a menace to society. Yeah, you are legally your menace. You know, it was like, they called me like this. They're like, I'm like a threat. Street rat. But, but. Street rat. They're like telling me that, it proved that they're nothing but an agents of thretary themselves. Right. By like denying my right to express myself in my own free time. Yeah. Completely independent.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:00.452 --> 0:21:01.465]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:08.519 --> 0:21:10.459]: 
  Oh my god.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:21:23.200 --> 0:21:27.587]: 
  NS.... to other society They call really this, exactly Europe The nice thing is we just started

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:29.494 --> 0:21:32.009]: 
  That's your business, you son of a bitch!

 SPEAKER_04 [0:21:33.848 --> 0:21:34.945]: 
  Yeah, you are.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:45.188 --> 0:21:46.504]: 
  Extremeelling

 SPEAKER_04 [0:21:46.504 --> 0:21:47.449]: 
  Tell me that

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:00.949 --> 0:22:04.375]: 
  what I do in school.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:22:04.375 --> 0:22:08.492]: 
  found like a fucking like severed head in your bag or something yeah that would be different but but but

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:06.906 --> 0:22:09.994]: 
  Yeah, that would be different. But, but, but, we use, what people...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:22:09.994 --> 0:22:32.505]: 
  when they see things specifically and I think this is a small tangent but I like to go on it when people see maybe something like your work they would think this guy's gonna be a psycho or whatever and it's it's you get that a lot right yeah oh god I was terrified to meet you I thought you were gonna be a I thought even I met you in 2010 and I talked to you I was like this guy's right nice but even before I met you in 2000 will you see the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:21.739 --> 0:22:21.959]: 
  yet it's nextarson or어

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:24.557 --> 0:22:26.734]: 
  I thought even shit

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:32.505 --> 0:23:05.445]: 
  2014 I knew I knew because not to go with like what you said like but me it's weird because actually me and Chad actually go way back in other terms like we go way but I didn't even know Shad and he knew me like that's how far back we go and I was kind of in the same boat with Chad where you know I had done a lot of morally unacceptable things back when I yeah but this is the criminal department it was a little bit criminal justice department didn't bring you way to make you sign official I also wasn't like oh yeah the reason I the reason I brought

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:54.021 --> 0:22:56.451]: 
  Yeah, but the criminal department...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:58.409 --> 0:22:58.999]: 
  Bring you in a minute.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:22:58.999 --> 0:23:34.994]: 
  you signed official documents. I also wasn't like, oh yeah, look at your camera. The reason I brought up is because I think there's a big difference. You are the, in the nicest way, you're not a horrible person. You would never, like, it's art for you. It's disconnected from reality. You're not a psycho who would fucking shoot with a theater or something. When you sneak in on a weirdo, I have to do the stroke. So like, look, look, if they think, if they looked into you and they saw, they somehow found something questionable, like they found you were trying to meet with a girl or something like that, I would get it. But, there's

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:21.004 --> 0:23:26.556]: 
  You see you're not a weirdo motor

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:34.994 --> 0:23:45.085]: 
  doing their jobs obviously but there's also there's also you should you should do the right thing.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:38.909 --> 0:23:43.094]: 
  It's a way of education.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:23:43.094 --> 0:23:53.826]: 
  My point, my point was that, that distinction is very, very obvious, especially with you. Yeah, and what I love- I never felt that you would do a negative thing as to a person because of your aunt.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:49.270 --> 0:23:51.008]: 
  Yeah, and what I love?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:53.995 --> 0:25:40.155]: 
  What I love is that they, the way they address it too, is like they found some hidden secret amongst them. You're like, dude, I uploaded this, you asshole! Public website that I gave to the studio! But the whole thing is also kind of like with my whole appearance and stuff at the time. Like I was quite into like heavy metal and stuff, and that also was like for people like those, like kind of like conservative art professors or the kind of red flag. Very, very, very kind of things. People showed off the whole like satanic themes and like the glorification of that violin, such as the shirt I'm wearing, Cannibal Corpse. Like it is, that to people who don't understand it, it raises flags. It's full and it's completely terrifying to them. Especially the old geezers, because they wouldn't get it. They're listening to like the classic blues and jazz and then they come in and you're like... Dude, it's Switzerland dude. They're just listening to like five CDs of yodeling. But anyways, to go back, they told me, you gotta turn yourself in to your local police department. Wow, really? Yeah, I was like, I was shocked. Like I was in a like small town in Switzerland, like I was there in Zurich and I just felt like... My world fell apart. Like I felt devastated. And then they said like... And they also said this really weird thing where they said, give us a call in the evening. You just want to make sure you didn't hurt yourself. They thought you were going to kill yourself or something? And that just insulted me so much. Like I was not going to give them the satisfaction of like showing them that I was devastated. Right. But obviously I was, but I was just like, yeah, okay, like I get it. And they say, don't come back like you're... You're banned. And I asked them, like, can I maybe come back next year or something? They're like, no, we don't want you back. You're permanently banned. You're permanently banned. Whoa. And this is the only way we could even consider you to get you back is you go to the psychologist and have like sessions with him and... Jesus. And like just like... And that would take so long and cost so much money. It's all over the place.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:58.534 --> 0:24:01.116]: 
  Yeah, you're like, dude, I uploaded this, you asshole.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:01.116 --> 0:24:03.462]: 
  Public website that it gave to the studio.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:03.462 --> 0:24:03.951]: 
  the world.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:04.086 --> 0:24:04.103]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:27.019 --> 0:24:27.340]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:24:29.280 --> 0:24:29.584]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:29.584 --> 0:24:29.820]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:34.444 --> 0:24:36.334]: 
  Dude, it's Switzerland, dude. They're just listening to like,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:44.316 --> 0:24:44.940]: 
  Wow.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:44.940 --> 0:24:45.227]: 
  really

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:45.227 --> 0:24:45.379]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:07.047 --> 0:25:07.452]: 
  And

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:14.337 --> 0:25:15.417]: 
  Devastated right?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:26.115 --> 0:25:26.942]: 
  Really big

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:27.449 --> 0:25:28.039]: 
  뭐?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:39.497 --> 0:25:44.273]: 
  And by the way, all of that for like a baby, they can still decline you after that. They can see if you can go through it. You're usually like that.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:43.446 --> 0:25:49.049]: 
  You're usually like the sanest chillest guy that I fucking hung out with. Well I would say like I think...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:47.597 --> 0:26:00.456]: 
  Well, I was saying, like, I think people like him, they put this stuff out there, but the pedophiles always try to be the guys who make the kid-friendly Minecraft stuff or the fucking, you know, the... Oh yeah. It's always those guys. There is such a...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:58.077 --> 0:25:58.971]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:58.971 --> 0:26:14.260]: 
  always it's always those guys there is such a huge ratio of like of that especially online yeah where it's like the either I don't want to say just Minecraft but like there's just a lot of those like it's hey guys yeah or the prank guys or whatever where it ends up being like yeah they're fucking some 13

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:08.472 --> 0:26:09.029]: 
  It's a big one.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:10.885 --> 0:26:11.003]: 
  this video. Thanks for watching. I'll see you in the next video.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:11.003 --> 0:26:11.340]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:13.484 --> 0:26:20.217]: 
  But then the guys you draw like people getting decapitated stuff They're the nicest guys ever you mean really for they have you have a beard on the toilet There's like there was a Disney

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:18.968 --> 0:26:35.050]: 
  There was a Disney animator who like frequently released, he was an old Disney animator who did like the old black and white cartoons and he frequently released like mutilation. Like he released like people getting their arms, he like actually cutting their own arms off and really detailed like.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:26.444 --> 0:26]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:29.819 --> 0:26:30.342]: 
  Sure.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:35.860 --> 0:26:40.180]: 
  Styles of whatever look like when the bodies come but he was as normal as

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:39.809 --> 0:26:56.751]: 
  I think in chat I'll let you get back to what you were saying but I just just just a small tangent I think You know we've said before the podcast so we're gonna tour the dirtie But I feel like it is just because it's almost therapeutic. It's like here's here's every horrible thought my head Here's every here's the quote-unquote worst thoughts and here they are and now I feel better now. They're out of my head

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:54.777 --> 0:27:11.449]: 
  And now if you bet now they're out of my head. I feel like that's kind of what this this podcast is Yeah, we can just sort of yeah and say horrible stuff. It's even to a total We also mean it in a joking way like everything we say even if it's really mean or like it hits home It like really upset you it's like I never say I could see

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:58.574 --> 0:26:58.945]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:58.945 --> 0:27:00.126]: 
  we can just sort of say.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:01.004 --> 0:27:03.889]: 
  Absolutely. We also mean it in a joking way.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:10.200 --> 0:27:11.989]: 
  I could safely say I can't

 SPEAKER_04 [0:27:10.217 --> 0:27:17.642]: 
  I could simply say I could simply say I've never said anything in the podcast that I said with malicious intent Yeah, we try to not

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:15.145 --> 0:27:18.992]: 
  with malicious intent. We try to not name drop certain people.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:27:18.992 --> 0:27:25.911]: 
  If somebody said you said this joke and it really hurt my feelings because of whatever I have a personal connection.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:20.494 --> 0:27:21.439]: 
  if somebody said if somebody

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:25.590 --> 0:27:28.949]: 
  Well then, and then they also should understand that you're kind of like

 SPEAKER_04 [0:27:28.949 --> 0:27:33.437]: 
  My point is even then I'll still feel I'm not gonna feel good if I heard somebody's feeling it, but at the same time I never...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:29.489 --> 0:27:30.130]: 
  even though FBI and state

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:33.437 --> 0:27:37.943]: 
  No, yeah, but they should understand that even if they walk a huge walk by the big day

 SPEAKER_04 [0:27:34.821 --> 0:27:49.418]: 
  even if they walk into a life of the big thing is that it reminds me look it's like you'll have it you laugh because we for this person that person this person like maybe you laugh at the black joke he told earlier whatever don't be an idiot but then but then when you tell a fat joke it's like I'm fat you take it with pretty yeah don't be an Indian gamer it's

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:44.507 --> 0:27:45.503]: 
  Don't be an idiot

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:48.034 --> 0:27:59.121]: 
  Yeah, don't eat any and give her. It's either give everything or don't give anything at all. Well, that was the whole thing with South Park was like, they were talking about like, oh yeah, everybody thinks it's funny until the joke's about you. And then all of a sudden, they're not funny at all. They're really effective.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:51.089 --> 0:27:52.169]: 
  Well that was the whole thing itself.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:27:56.505 --> 0:27:57.450]: 
  And then all the stuff.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:27:58.699 --> 0:28:04.960]: 
  You can literally laugh at not even a single person going, oh, a book and then it gets to you and you're like, oh, that, I don't, I feel like it's a hurt.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:03.458 --> 0:28:05.939]: 
  Yeah, I feel like I heard

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:05.500 --> 0:28:46.506]: 
  So Shed, they tell you that you're a menace, they tell you you need psychological help, they tell you that you're not allowed back into school. And to give myself in. Turn yourself in. Right, and to call them later to let them know that you didn't commit suicide. Yes. Okay. And so as I usually did, I took the train and like I went to the local graveyard to contemplate what just happened. I usually did that. And that's therapeutic. I was just thinking like I'm going to have to go home and face my mother. Yeah. I don't have to explain this to them. They didn't even know I do that kind of stuff. Right. And I had to face my parents and explain this to them why.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:16.587 --> 0:28:17.397]: 
  Turn yourself in.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:21.497 --> 0:28:21.717]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:47.249 --> 0:28:58.065]: 
  I have, I, why my life now has no future. Did you consider lying? Did you consider making up a story? No, not even, not for a single moment. Good man, good man.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:28:49.527 --> 0:28:49.949]: 
  I have no idea.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:49.949 --> 0:28:52.834]: 
  our future.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:52.834 --> 0:28:53.003]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:28:53.003 --> 0:28:53.830]: 
  up the store.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:28:55.990 --> 0:29:04.799]: 
  I'm assuming your head was more like, well I can't. Cause you can't lie to them and say, oh yeah, cause you're gonna have to, you can't lie about this.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:03.904 --> 0:30:27.435]: 
  That's the same. In my mind I was more thinking like, what's next? What will I do after? Can I still like... Can I go... Yeah, that was a talk for you. I would do the same thing though. If I was in a situation where my parents confront me about what I do, I'd be like, yeah, I do it because it's what I do. I've done it for years and I'm not going to change. At that moment, were you thinking that you were done with games? Yeah. Did all these things start flashing? Because initially it was like, you got into college, you were going to do your game design. I was definitely thinking I'm not going to do anything creative for the rest of my life. You thought you were done? Like, oh, enough for a job. I'm not going to do it. And I told myself I'm going to just quit. You thought you were just going to do like a desk job the rest of your life? Yeah, I just thought like, I'll just come with me. But I would not consider that whatever do anything creative. And so I called and I said, like I explained it to them, I went home and I kind of like, how you guys say, face the music. And I reported myself into the police department. No you didn't. I did. I went there. I spoke with like a true gentleman. Jesus. I confronted them and they set me down in this interrogation room and they printed out all this stuff, hung it up on the wall. All your drawings. Yeah, not all of them, but that's just some of the more extreme ones. They started questioning me and it was just such a bizarre experience. It was like in a dream. Yeah. Look at this Kafka night man. Yeah. What was he like?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:29:09.726 --> 0:29:10.789]: 
  I can't go, yeah, that would have been...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:30.060 --> 0:29:31.377]: 
  because initially it was like you gotta

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:36.355 --> 0:29:36.996]: 
 哦

 SPEAKER_04 [0:29:36.996 --> 0:29:37.739]: 
  to do any...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:29:41.147 --> 0:29:42.531]: 
  I'm gonna you thought you just did you a good desk

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:59.001 --> 0:29:59.440]: 
  And I

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:01.431 --> 0:30:02.460]: 
  I know you didn't. I did.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:04.705 --> 0:30:06.089]: 
  Jesus!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:14.054 --> 0:30:16.112]: 
  All your drawings. Yeah, not all of them.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:24.786 --> 0:30:25.005]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:25.005 --> 0:30:29.460]: 
  Yeah, what was the expression on your face at that point?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:29.140 --> 0:30:59.093]: 
  That is literally out of a coffin, it's like story though. Sturn, like, because you can't show, you gotta still remain the shark. So your tears are invisible under water. So you're still not turning back? You could be... No neck! No you could be! Never! But the two of you are on the water! You're committed though, right? You could be a hammerhead shark. You should have... You could have been the most evil sharks in the water. You could have been the hammerhead. You're not the most evil one. No, instead you were a white silverback. You're the ones that like, fuck you. That's a gorilla, Corey. Yeah. The type of shark. But so, so I'm assuming... You play car bombs.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:35.957 --> 0:30:37.054]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:38.505 --> 0:30:38.809]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [0:30:45.002 --> 0:30:46.589]: 
  You should have called me Eve.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:50.790 --> 0:30:51.955]: 
  That was amazing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:53.254 --> 0:30:53.507]: 
  You're the best.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:55.937 --> 0:31:01.945]: 
  Yeah. But so, so, I assume- You fight car bombs. I'm assuming- Ruin your credit score. I'm assuming-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:58.502 --> 0:30:59.076]: 
  bones

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:01.152 --> 0:31:06.214]: 
  I'm assuming you're doing it. Yes! Let me tell you something about credit score. You were saying sex?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:01.439 --> 0:31:02.046]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:31:07.784 --> 0:31:09.944]: 
  I can't even recall. I can't even recall! Anyway.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:08.425 --> 0:31:08.560]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:08.560 --> 0:31:11.462]: 
  I did it okay! Anyway...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:09.944 --> 0:31:15.259]: 
  Yeah, yeah, so you're sitting there in the interrogation room, they've hung up all the art you've done, you're like, yeah, I know, I drew it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:31:14.314 --> 0:31:17.993]: 
  I would say I'm assuming at this point you you're like I've already been caught

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:17.993 --> 0:31:24.945]: 
  I might as well just kind of sit here and just do it just stick stick the I see like I see what they can give me how would

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:21.975 --> 0:31:50.714]: 
  I just see what they can give me. How were they treating you? They were still staying polite, but they obviously were not. They didn't have, they were like, this is like kind of a scumbag. They thought you were stupid. They were trying to stay polite. They were talking down to you. Talking down to me, that's the word. And they let me off, they made me assure them I would delete the website, delete everything, and I had to pay a gratuitous fine. What? Yes. Wait, you had to pay a fine?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:24.439 --> 0:31:24.962]: 
  How are you?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:31:33.906 --> 0:31:35.695]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:49.735 --> 0:31:52.452]: 
  Wait, you're going to pay a fine for drawing? Yes.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:31:52.249 --> 0:31]: 
  Yes. What is the bullpuck for that if you want to be asking? No.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31 --> 0:33:04.626]: 
  before that even happened like this is this is really stupid but before that even happened before I reported myself in while it was on the train like a week earlier the police took me out searched me and found a knife on me which was larger than I was legally allowed to possess so they also topped it off with like illegal weapon possession so I was like okay like this this is my life now you know and you were asking for the ballpark for that of the fight yeah it's not gonna sound large for you but it was like 2800 but it's like I mean like it's not like it's too large and but it's still unreasonable to pay for what you because if you can't pay that then what happens you go to jail yeah I wouldn't even consider that but probably probably maybe like yet to like do some community shit or pee out yeah but I was like for to me at the time was huge it was like there's a fortune yeah all my money like you know it's like more like it's just so much fucking money like I never like I just fucking baffled at that time like obviously I was I was broke

 SPEAKER_04 [0:32:18.996 --> 0:32:19.604]: 
  So

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:23.282 --> 0:32:23.856]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:32:32.175 --> 0:32:33.441]: 
  That there is a lot of it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:36.293 --> 0:32:38.402]: 
  That's still a great plan.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:32:42.368 --> 0:32:42.655]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:32:47.802 --> 0:32:49.455]: 
  Asian or P are you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:05.706 --> 0:33:12.709]: 
  Everybody looked down to me everybody thought everybody thought I was this fucking scumbag. What did you lose friends over there?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:11.612 --> 0:33:12.389]: 
  You lose, friend.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:13.890 --> 0:34:00.938]: 
  I didn't have that many friends to begin with, so I was kinda one of those guys. More like kind of a... You were a lone wolf. Lone Shark. I kinda chose to walk alone a lot of times, but... I walked... Yeah, I was just selecting Redone. In America, I mean in Switzerland, army service is mandatory. Okay. So, I thought like, okay, I'll just do my army service now instead of a few years later. I'll just enlist right now and get away from all of this shit. Yeah. So, that's when I enlisted and I told them I don't even care what you give me and they gave me a service as an artillery tank man. Whoa. So they took your knife away and they handed you a tank. They handed you a gun and a tank. It was mandatory.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:17.789 --> 0:33:19.746]: 
  You were a low wolf.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:25.602 --> 0:33:25.990]: 
  and in a

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:25.635 --> 0:33:25.922]: 
  It is.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:40.114 --> 0:33:40.384]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:51.994 --> 0:33:52.602]: 
  So they

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:52.602 --> 0:33:53.462]: 
  They took your knife away.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:54.323 --> 0:33:58.002]: 
  They handed you a tag. They handed you a gun.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:58.002 --> 0:34:13.763]: 
  tank. It was mandatory. What's crazy to me is that Switzerland has made it to our service but the country is famous for not for being neutral. Oh yeah, yeah it has always been. I don't know much about Switzerland's history. What is the last war you guys were in?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:08.194 --> 0:34:10.860]: 
  Oh yeah, yeah, it is. It has always been. I don't know.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:13.763 --> 0:34:30.942]: 
  They defeated Hitler. Single-handedly. Hitler wanted to invade us, but they couldn't because of the mountains. Because Switzerland flexed their arms and Hitler blushed and turned and ran away. Yeah. The mountains blocked Hitler. You couldn't see over the mountains. It was like, nobody's over there. It's like the other place.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:15.467 --> 0:34:16.716]: 
  Yeah, they go handedly.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:20.327 --> 0:34:21.610]: 
  Because Switzerland...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:24.732 --> 0:34:29.440]: 
  Yeah. The mountains blocked it. You couldn't see over the mountains.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:29.440 --> 0:34:30.452]: 
  Yeah, it's like the other

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:32.562 --> 0:35:03.342]: 
  Are you just saying? Yeah. And I enlisted in the Army and the minimum thing there is like five months, but you have to do an entire year, but you have to do five months at once and you can come back. Can I say something also? I was also talking to Shadr this point on Skype. I think we were actually like communicating at this point, like via mouth. At first when I first met Shadr, he was very reserved. He wanted to talk to me and I was fine. I typed you until eventually we came around and we talked. That's pretty much italk to Skype.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:45.927 --> 0:34:46.500]: 
  Can I, can I?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:46.500 --> 0:34:48.222]: 
  say something also.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:52.304 --> 0:34:52.996]: 
  Yeah, we like that.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:04.067 --> 0:36:59.340]: 
  I was gonna say I typed to Shad I typed to Shad I typed, I typed, I typed to pure help I talked to Shad as we did I typed, I could get it, I was just getting tongue-tied and then like that day he's like I gotta leave for five months, I'll see you later and I was like, oh okay dude good lord but basically with the army, even though we don't have a war and stuff, they still train them like real soldiers, they make them go through everything like we would actually have a war and like the whole army thing it really made me look at life differently because it's just your whole world gets taken away from you does it put things in perspective? yes it does, you know that the citizen speaks of opportunity and the diplomat he speaks of authority and or of policy but the soldier, he doesn't talk at all the soldier just acts and that's why it kind of made me realize that I should stop trying to think over things and just go for what I really feel like even though I thought my world fell apart and stuff, I didn't know what to do in the flames of adversity my will was just forged anew I just had this new iron will that I am not over do you think a lot of people get that from that experience or do you feel like it was kind of specific to you? I think a lot of people get that because it makes everything else seem a lot easier because you go through this really controlled and difficult life in the military that makes stuff in real life seem more like this is not as hard to do this gives you more confidence

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:07.679 --> 0:35:08.607]: 
  I форм

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:13.163 --> 0:35:13.787]: 
  We pay.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:35:16.622 --> 0:35:17.550]: 
  And then like,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:19.862 --> 0:35:22.950]: 
  And I was like, oh, okay, dude. Good Lord. Yes.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:35:30.848 --> 0:35:31.894]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:27.649 --> 0:36:28.155]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:31.649 --> 0:36:32.543]: 
  아예 어린다

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:40.069 --> 0:36:40.947]: 
  sure

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:40.947 --> 0:36:41.453]: 
  that because

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:59.999 --> 0:37:39.587]: 
  That's interesting because they talk about like the American military has a saying called the, I think it's for the army be all you can be. And a lot of times that is kind of one of the major benefits they say that people get or one of the things they walk away with is the idea that they have more confidence that they can tackle bigger problems. They can start that business. They can handle situations better. That is very true. I mean I guess you see in the movies, I guess I always thought the opposite was happening though. I thought it was a breaking down. They break you down but they build you up again.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:27.117 --> 0:37:27.960]: 
  That is very true.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:34.002 --> 0:37:35.132]: 
  They break it down but they...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:36.111 --> 0:37:36.499]: 
  I see.

  MBC 뉴스 이덕영입니다.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:39.014 --> 0:37:50.489]: 
  When you first got back to your house after that first kind of police talk, like, did you talk to your parents that night? Yes. And like, what was the reaction?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:48.497 --> 0:37:48.902]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:51.012 --> 0:38:23.226]: 
  The action was more like, um... Were you like shitting your pants? Were they like, what the fuck? Or were they like, oh that's terrible? You see, I wasn't shitting my pants. Because like, fear is often a barn of uncertainty. Yeah. And I was certain. I knew that what was gonna happen. I knew they wouldn't like that. I knew what I did. So I was just more like... Accepting. Accepting and more angry at myself that it was so ignorant to like, be so free and open online about those kind of things. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:23.935 --> 0:38:43.172]: 
  And, but, obviously, everybody has a certain respect towards their parents. Right. But it also, I also kind of think that in the end, I can stand on my own feet. Even if they wouldn't want to accept me anymore, I could still somehow survive.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:43.392 --> 0:38:50.344]: 
  So how long was that period after that happened? Like were you brooding around the place kind of mopey or? No, no, I- I- I went straight onto the- Pretty fast.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:48.167 --> 0:38:53.466]: 
  No, no, I just went straight onto the air. Pretty fast, it goes only a few weeks. Oh. They're pretty fast. I have to ask.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:38:58.984 --> 0:39:06.949]: 
  I'm not the most patriotic guy, but I consider, at least thought about, joining the military. Do you think it's good to kill a guy?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:06.949 --> 0:39:15.370]:

  I think that's what I mean. Where did you- was there a ranking? Like, do you know how well you did? How well you stacked up with everybody else? The thing is, I was not a very good soldier, but I have a very thick skin. I do not let things get to me too easily. So if they physically really just harass me, that I'm broken down and I am physically exhausted, I can just get back up again. Right. And I always had a sense of humor about things. Like, I just don't- if you don't like things get to you, because it's mostly also psychological. Sure. Because they do things like we're- it's like a full metal jacket. Yeah. Or when you do something wrong, everybody else gets punished so they hate you. So they hate you, yeah. Yeah. It's a group effort. We are one thing of due kind.

  Triple H was a place. Triple H. Triple H is a freaking wrestler. Triple H is going to take it to double. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. I just kind of get an idea of what hazing was going on. Yeah. One of the officers showed a little bit of weakness. He showed a little bit of a weakling. And when they showed that...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:33.415 --> 0:42:33.870]: 
  counsel was

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:34.984 --> 0:42:37.499]: 
  It's basically Jesus.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:42:37.499 --> 0:42:40.924]: 
  So you kinda get an idea of what was going on. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:42:48.771 --> 0:42:49.564]: 
  And when they shoot at.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:50.560 --> 0:42:52.146]: 
  They attack.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:42:51.049 --> 0:42:53.445]: 
  Like piranhas are like a dead piece of meat.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:53.445 --> 0:43:29.963]: 
  towards the end he went into his barrack dragged him out tied him up with like foil wrapping a trapping foil put him on a little package like those thing you're trolleys the trolly car and started rolling him up to the river he was there crying a grown-ass man crying red in the face tears rolling down his face people surrounding him snapping pictures with their cell phones laughing at that so other officers see it and they join in they think it's funny I think it's they don't even protect me they think it's selfish

 SPEAKER_04 [0:43:06.709 --> 0:43:07.941]: 
  and in the trollyumi!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:23.989 --> 0:43:24.765]: 
  other office

 SPEAKER_04 [0:43:29.339 --> 0:43:32.494]: 
  I was assuming the guy thought they were gonna kill him right?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:32.494 --> 0:43:56.828]: 
  They said, now we're gonna push him into the river and someone came and the hires up came up and was like, Okay, we can't do that. This will actually kill him. But they really wanted to do it. They're like, oh, come on. Oh, wow. They really, they would have done it. Really? Yes, they would have done it. It's like a bunch of screaming aides. Yeah, it is. It is. So scary. That dude, that actually- Wait, they would have killed him? They would have thrown him into the river. Yeah, but they would have like, like, grabbed him. I mean, I don't know what they would have tried.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:47.344 --> 0:43:48.441]: 
  It is.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:52.204 --> 0:43:52.997]: 
  That, that, yeah, but they're

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:52.997 --> 0:43:59.460]: 
  They would have like, what, grabbed him. I mean, I don't know what they would have done. That's mom mentality, it was worse. But yeah, like the hand.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:58.380 --> 0:44:20.267]: 
  But, yeah, like the hazing was not very friendly, but that's just part of the experience. Wow, see, that sounds worse than the soap or the flagpole. That was a full metal jacket rule. Dude, yeah, tying a guy down with foil on a trolley and jumping him in the river would fucking kill him. But the worst part was the humiliation of everyone taking pictures of him crying. So if he did, but what if he didn't make any sound? Well, I guess they, that wouldn't have happened.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:14.867 --> 0:44:16.926]: 
  Oh no, of course. I'm taking pictures of him crying.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:16.926 --> 0:44:17.820]: 
  So if you did, but what if you didn't do it?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:19.845 --> 0:44:24.942]: 
  probably get an egglitter to try to fuck with a boy probably get him in the stomach and make him cry

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:21.955 --> 0:45:30.366]: 
  I would have tried to push him. I would have tried to push him. It made him cry. I've been looking at his bitch crying after beating his little faces bleeding. No, but he would have, they knew that he would have because he was already showing weakness. Yes, yes, they knew that. They knew that. So they psychologically, while he was like doing stuff, like they're doing push-ups, they're peering at him, looking at him, they're like, where'd he get this motherfucker? He thinks he's got us. That's great. Damn, dude. I know you got more of this story. You said also like, because like you still kind of did art there. Like you had, oh I did a sketchbook. It feels like you, I remember you, I don't know if you like uploaded it to, you showed us, but you uploaded like your, Oh, upload some of it. Yeah, your sketchbook and it was really sweet. Like did you show people like your art and stuff? Yeah, I kind of got around that I drew, but it was not like, it's just kind of a thing that I then, I, for example, I did like the, I designed like the badges of our platoon or I did like the, our emblem on the tank and stuff like that. Yeah, yeah. There's just like nice little things. There's a tank with your artwork on it? Yeah, like the, at least for the emblem. Shit, you know how badass that is. There is a tank with your artwork on it. Well, those tanks will never be used to kill anybody. So what? It's still cool. Oh, but. And like it's not just Gravini, it's like actually supposed to be there. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:24.942 --> 0:44:26.140]:

I couldn't even draw I had to give my half my work to my other friend because I couldn't draw I was sitting there. There were just spots constantly in my face I thought I saw like a fucking like little mini shadow guy running around my room Like he was just like scurrying around. I had no idea what I was saying any kind of sleep deprivation The first thing that I get is a peripheral like I always see things out of the corner of my eye It is actually like being basically schizo like you're just looking around you constantly feel like somebody's looking at you And you're just like I I need to sleep.

I remember looking at the crack of the shower where it occurred that the wall was like, wouldn't it be scary if a fucking face appeared right there? And I kept staring at it. I kept thinking about it. And I got the more scared I got the more I looked at it. And then my brain like, caught a little fucking, like the most terrifying face it could.

Yeah, the last thing you do is like do this whole thing where you give back your weapon, like you do inventory. There's also of course a drag. Inventory sucks. But I would have had to go back every year for another month until I have an entire year. It's because I only did a half a year. But when I went back, the hardship and sorrow gave focus to my life. And I knew...

And I was really happy. It's like, okay, let's just be graphic design artists. That sounds pretty neat. And the things they had me do there were like, designing like drawing penguins for an iPhone game. Oh my god, I didn't know that dude. And fucking concept of a year show.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:05.592 --> 0:57:38.016]: 
  It was it made me realize if I'm gonna do something creative I'm gonna have to do it myself because I can't do this. This is fucking torture like this I don't want to live when I can when did we talk about website stuff? I remember there was a point before I started like talking talking to you we discussed web stuff It was probably like 2011 or something. Yeah, that's it. Was that well after all your military? That was that was after the military stuff. That was during that crap. Oh, okay And I I thought like I'm gonna dig back up that old domain name shed base I had and turn it Resurrected resurrect and turn it into like a webcomic site. I thought like fuck it I'm just gonna try it even though I don't know how to draw. I'll just fucking do it Yeah, and I started that like while having that shitty graphic design bullshit And I said like I'm gonna quit that and just get away from Switzerland say fuck Switzerland and move to Canada is hit like the reset button and Just do whatever I can to make this website happen and be able to live off of myself in Canada There was no plan B. There was only plan a alternative making this work Balls or nothing. Yes. All right. I was not like I was not interested in the possibility of defeat not at all and so I did that and like After like one and a half years in Canada I I managed to somehow establish the website. I don't even know how it happened all the online hate and all like There was so much hatred like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:15.008 --> 0:56:15.582]: 
  When did we

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:25.639 --> 0:56:26.753]: 
  Yeah, that's it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:28.457 --> 0:56:29.318]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:09.143 --> 0:57:09.447]: 
  There was no

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:09.447 --> 0:57:12.366]: 
  No plan B. Only plan A. No alternative.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:19.892 --> 0:57:20.635]: 
  Nice.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:38.944 --> 0:57:57.389]: 
  I just real hatred. Do you know what it was though? That was like the equivalent of like the hazing where you had to have a thick skin. I think other people would have given up or other people would have been run out of town. But this was like your military training. You could take it all day long and you just kept smiling. I was her hatred. I don't remember.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:40.328 --> 0:57:41.813]: 
  Do you know what it was though?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:57:55.178 --> 0:57:58.941]: 
  That was her hatred, I don't remember.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:58.941 --> 0:58:19.377]: 
  the content and stuff like people people thought I'm in like the topics wise because like I We talked all time, but he was always getting stuff like people thought he was a Pedophile But not only the content it was also because I couldn't draw properly. I was a really yeah Because I couldn't drop I

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:09.100 --> 0:58:09.994]: 
  Pedophile!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:09.994 --> 0:58:11.513]: 
  We have one point.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:14.095 --> 0:58:16.356]: 
  I was a really easy target because I

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:14.939 --> 0:58:15.495]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:17.115 --> 0:58:23.157]: 
  I mean portions were offered. You've got a much bigger fan base now and you probably draw the same kind of shit, right?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:23.157 --> 0:58:23.714]: 
  Mmm.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:23.714 --> 0:58:27.645]: 
  No? Still similar, like still rooted in the same area. Would you say you're similar?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:58:26.937 --> 0:58:33.282]: 
  You say you've softened up a little bit not softened up But you think you've changed directions you think you did that you're like that's enough. I've done that I've gone

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:32.438 --> 0:59:20.363]: 
  I've gone less I've obviously grown up a little bit so I've noticed that I'm a lot less violent than I used to be You know, I should I should thank you also because you kind of like rerouting me back to what I used to do You know, I should thank you because a lot of people think that I got Corey into drawing porn No, no, Corey got me into drawing it way back. No, the truth is when I first came I'm not gonna I'm not gonna people can go look it up if they want but when I first came to the internet I wasn't one of those people who Came to upload his AMVs to YouTube and all this like shit I didn't come to play Newgrounds games the first thing I did was to start drawing porn on the internet and I was I didn't know what I was doing didn't go to any anatomy classes. I had no idea what I was doing So I came on I just drew porn, but I drew what I wanted to see and since

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:38.277 --> 0:58:38.445]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:38.445 --> 0:58:40.015]: 
  No, I shouldn't.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:51.726 --> 0:58:51.996]: 
  Wait

 SPEAKER_04 [0:58:51.996 --> 0:58:52.722]: 
  David!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:54.764 --> 0:58:55.270]: 
  Vai ir já, pera-c Bora lá cremar

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:21.122 --> 1:00:27.137]: 
  And then I met a friend who kind of like shaped my vulgarity. I kind of wanted to, because I have been introduced to all this other stuff, and I'm the kind of person who, you know, when someone tells me to do something, I do the opposite. Like they're like, do this, and I'm like, okay, I'll do the opposite. Because it's like, you want me to do that? I don't give a shit. This is what I want to do. When I see something, I see the potential in the other thing. And that's kind of like where nobody was doing this, so I'm like, fuck it, I'll do it. And then I did it. And then I kind of shaped myself, but I kind of like got back into doing like cartoons and stuff. But in the back of my mind, I was always like, man, I need to go back to drawing, like art. I need to go back to learning how to art. Because like now I'm like, I feel like every day I'm learning something new about anatomy. I'm learning something new about colors, lighting, and it's just like, it's slowly, I feel like I'm shaping. And that's because I was given another opportunity a few years ago, whenever basically like I had, I hit the bottom of the barrel. I'm like, okay, I need to change my life around or I'm going to have to go live with my parents and possibly hang myself doing something like that. So, and now it's like, here I am. And that's mainly because of...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:21.147 --> 1:00:22.834]: 
  Yeah. Doing something like that.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:27.964 --> 1:01:02.912]: 
  Shad. Oh yeah, that's cool. But also, I also have to say to all the miserable reception, all the hatred, there's some positive stuff in that because hatred nourishes you, or in my case, nourishes me more than praise. It makes me, it is like that that gives me the teeth to bite and tear, you know, like the fists to bludgeon. It is that which makes me stay angry. And if I stay angry, I stay productive.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:31.508 --> 1:00:32.402]: 
  Also

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:59.504 --> 1:01:00.010]: 
  You know something.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:02.069 --> 1:01:17.999]: 
  Yes Chris. Something else too is like if you're getting a lot of hatred it just inspires you in a way. Yes. Like well I know that's what you're saying but for me it's not the same as what you're saying when I first started off on the internet I was completely faggot right? I was a horrible faggot. I think everybody was.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:06.929 --> 1:01:08.228]: 
  Yes. Well, I know that's what you're saying.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:15.518 --> 1:01:15.636]: 
  This is the end of this video. Thank you for watching. I hope you enjoyed it. I'll see you in the next video.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:16.497 --> 1:01:24.782]: 
  I think everybody was. I was the biggest baggater. I think we should draw as Americans.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:17.999 --> 1:01:22.943]: 
  I was the biggest fan. I think we should draw some action.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:22.943 --> 1:01:31.515]: 
  So what I'm saying is if you get a lot of hate everyone's like you're faggot you're like oh, okay. Yeah, sorry You're not a faggot anymore. Yeah, you grow

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:28.444 --> 1:01:28.495]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:28.495 --> 1:01:37.405]: 
  Yeah, sorry. And then you're not affected anymore. Yeah, you grow, you, like, I feel like I at this point, anyone can say anything to me and I would just be like, oh, alright.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:37.405 --> 1:01:45.117]: 
  You know, the internet is a weird place to be new to because there's a lot of unspoken rules that you have to learn along the way.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:41.624 --> 1:01:42.282]: 
  because

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:44.661 --> 1:01:52.440]: 
  You can't get pretty it's pretty much a lot like your place to like okay what you put out there everyone will see forever It will be saved for you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:51.884 --> 1:01:55.950]: 
  You pretty much can't be a dick ever on the internet you have to learn to or if you're a dick

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:55.292 --> 1:05:11.532]: 
  Or if you're a dick you would you you have to own it you have to own it Absolutely, you cannot pedal around stuff if you're an asshole to someone in someone corners you and says oh you're an asshole And like yeah, I'm an asshole because this is my reasoning It's like it's cool if the bullies bully you and you show them that you're vulnerable they keep doing it Exactly doing it even harder. Yeah, they'll have the meanest rage-paces to send you And it's like it's not like you could like convert them or anything like death is the only lesson they would understand Exactly pretty much what it comes down to it's like the the the baby rule that we learned in school It's like if someone's but the internet is so different than like react in like your your day-to-day Offline life because you're interacting with so many people Well not only so so it's exactly that which means not only are The interactions are not only so much more like in terms of quantity But they're a lot oftentimes a lot more vicious uncensored, you know because they don't think they're gonna see you So so they think they can say whatever you want Yeah, so it's like no matter who you are or no matter how much experience you have in life dealing like I think like I didn't join The game until I was like 30 and I wasn't really doing YouTube shit until I was like 31 But it's like I felt like I you know I dealt with a lot in my life And I felt like I could deal pretty well, but I remember when I first started out too like there'd be a wave of certain Criticisms and even then like is as solid as I thought I was I was What the fuck like I was trying to justify myself and trying to figure out trying to be like hey Maybe I can single this person out and be logical with them and then it'll make sense And then they just respond with like even you know whatever can't you can't justify on the internet It's like you you either you either own up you cannot fake anything and if you fake something you won't have to But now I mean I feel like in the last couple years I mean it didn't take very long I figured it out pretty quickly like this is what this beast is but after that I Literally because I get asked by people who aren't like online people sometimes Like oh, well, how do you deal with the criticism like oh, okay? So you know what I did I did a thing for how it should have ended was the Lord of the Rings cartoon Yeah, and if you saw initially the dislike to like ratio was like one-third I mean this thing got like a million views in a week and like one-third of the fucking people hated this thing Why and because they thought I was pushing the gay agenda They thought there was all this weirdest first of all It's the only cartoon I've ever done that had any kind of I'm sorry I don't mean to I don't mean to tread on like a topic like Lord of the Rings But I find Lord of Rings to be easy game for huge and I guess people were saying yeah, we've seen this a million times It's like well, I haven't honestly idea But regardless the the point being that there was so much hate but at this point this was very recently Some people were asking like how do you how do you deal with all these things? I saw all those comments because I linked people to it like my friends back in Washington and they're not on They're not like you know internet people, but they saw the comments. Yeah, and they were like oh my god, dude Are you okay? And I was like you have no idea how hilarious at this point maybe back if I first made a video Yeah, I'd probably take it to heart But at this point every comment that was like what the fuck is this bullshit or whatever I I Laugh harder

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:57.317 --> 1:01:58.448]: 
  to own it to you ever.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:58.448 --> 1:01:59.714]: 
  They're old here.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:59.714 --> 1:01:59.781]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:06.261 --> 1:02:07.493]: 
  It's like it's cool

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:07.493 --> 1:02:07.881]: 
  Cool.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:10.682 --> 1:02:12.690]: 
  Exactly. Keep doing it even harder. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:16.099 --> 1:02:18.495]: 
  Really good, you fucking blood boiling.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:18.495 --> 1:02:18.630]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:23.136 --> 1:02:23.963]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:28.418 --> 1:02:29.650]: 
  But the internet is so different.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:02:37.227 --> 1:02:39.876]: 
  That you'll never have to see from.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:57.730 --> 1:02:58.574]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:30.096 --> 1:03:30.484]: 
  maybe

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:35.513 --> 1:03:36.441]: 
  You know, whatever.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:42.769 --> 1:03:43.056]:

 SPEAKER_04 [1:05:15.413 --> 1:05:19.564]: 
  me I think I don't think everybody I'm not saying everybody because

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:19.564 --> 1:05:23.699]: 
  W's comments that are like well written Direct comments that you're like man that hurts It's literally like

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:34.769]: 
  Make it literally like the stuff I give to Shad. Like I'm like here's Shad, here's some art, and then he uploads it. No, but like Chris Flabbergasted that this is what I did. Chris and I did the improv where I...

 SPEAKER_04 [1:05:29.166 --> 1:05:29.959]: 
  No, but like,

 SPEAKER_04 [1:05:32.305 --> 1:05:59.997]: 
  Person I didn't improv where it was like a guy going to a vet. I love that one. That was my favorite one We smash just the dog. Yeah, I thought it was funny And then I the fact that all the comments like there were two kinds of comments There was there was one kind of comment that was like this is funny the second was like this isn't funny And the third was like this isn't funny and also fuck you for abusing animals the ones where people were like fuck you I laughed at those. Yeah, but but if I see like you know to keep it short. I think that

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:37.148 --> 1:05:41.215]: 
  I love that one, that was my favorite one where he smashes the dog or something.

Like, after Canada, like, I kind of got to talk with Corey again, and sooner or later, like Corey said, like, why don't you just move to America? Like, it was after one and a half years living there, and I was like, that is a great idea. And you moved here. Luckily, you're an American citizen, right? I moved here, and luckily, I was not only a Swiss citizen, also an American citizen, because of my heritage. And that's how I got to know all you guys.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:55.412 --> 1:09:01.724]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:14.716 --> 1:09:47.978]:

If Zach got caught at the train station with his Hitler youth knife, would they like... He would make a lot of friends. The Nazi prison. You're a Nazi. No, but anyways, yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:10:00.938 --> 1:10:17.931]: 
  We didn't talk every day when we were together. We don't go together anymore, but we did talk every day. But, every once a week, probably twice a week, maybe once a week sometimes. I'd walk that big of glass of water and shed across me, and we would just look at the same thing. Four hours would pass, we would read these.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:16.969 --> 1:10:29.170]:

Like the distractions, the noise, the people who you don't feel like interacting with them because something's weird there. Nothing fruitful. Well, there is too.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:10:50.804 --> 1:11:05.029]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:10.733 --> 1:11:28.772]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:43.504 --> 1:11:45.951]: 
  No, it could have been just four minutes.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:46.997 --> 1:11:49.984]: 
  You see for me

 SPEAKER_04 [1:11:48.634 --> 1:11:51.638]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:02.269 --> 1:12:29.438]: 
  Okay, basically, the power went out and nobody else was home. But like Zach and me and some other guys. And we were talking there in the living room. We put some candles up everywhere. And we were talking about ghost stories. Like we were talking about things like just kind of the hidden fears in the back of people's minds. And I brought up like... What person did you bring up?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:03.450 --> 1:12:03.839]: 
  Oh

 SPEAKER_04 [1:12:13.997 --> 1:12:14.942]: 
  Hang on, I'll let you go.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:25.304 --> 1:12:25.455]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:29.438 --> 1:12:32.847]: 
  like what's the scariest thing that you've done? Like what's what's what's what's here for you to

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:31.379 --> 1:12:43.124]: 
  Yes. What's what's what's her place in the boat? And I brought up a fictional story about a certain stickman I've seen all throughout my youth and kept having reoccurring dreams of him.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:12:31.446 --> 1:12:33.437]: 
  What's your place as a boss?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:33.437 --> 1:12:33.825]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:38.297 --> 1:12:38.449]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:44.592 --> 1:12:56.455]: 
  I've seen him. I could have sworn I've seen him in real life as well. It all blends together with childhood memories and like just the ghost of my past.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:55.510 --> 1:12:59.442]: 
  He's bullshitting us with this straightest face you've ever seen like he has g

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:59.442 --> 1:13:01.230]: 
  I wasn't even sure if I was telling the truth.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:13:00.910 --> 1:13:04.859]: 
  I was I was like I was pretty 50 I was like 51

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:03.981 --> 1:13:05.500]: 
  I was like, I was like, I'm pretty sure

 SPEAKER_04 [1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:06.951]: 
  be sure to fuck with me like here dog cause he was like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:06.495 --> 1:13:14.207]: 
  because he had like he somehow bubbled up this genuine like fear in his eyes and put it right there and I was like man.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:14.005 --> 1:13:31.656]: 
  by candlelight too. The other person got like petrified. and asked me to like draw it and then... Did you just draw a stick? Yeah, I literally just did a fucking stick maker and the person almost started crying.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13 --> 1:13:15.507]:

  Yeah, no actual like uneasy brain

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:34.997 --> 1:14:14.873]: 
  Maybe it's yeah, they almost started crying. It's like like oh my god guys Looking at Zach is like Speaking of um of Pranking people shed you are a master prankster Some people some people wouldn't necessarily think that but I think it's because of this honesty that you're talking about That he can bubble up like he can just bring it right to the surface He can hone it in like and you never know if he's telling you like I like I like to see this much

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:50.134 --> 1:13:54.977]: 
  It's a fucking stick man.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:14:14.873 --> 1:14:22.264]: 
  I don't know I definitely don't want to like you know overwhelm you with like cop ones or anything But I everything would say is genuine right I feel like the best thing about you is you you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:21.100 --> 1:14:23.952]: 
  the best thing about you is you smell bullshit very quickly and you

 SPEAKER_04 [1:14:23.952 --> 1:14:49.450]: 
  you're like a hound. You turn upon like a dog that has eaten for days. It's more of a front-ed. Exactly, but sometimes you'll just fuck with people. You'll let them fuck with you. Just kind of poke them. Just to see... See their reaction. There's that old quote. I can't remember who it's by, but it's kind of like, you know, if you stick a sword in somebody and it's off, you stick all the way through, if it's hard, you pull back. It's kind of like, you know, like this what you do a little bit. Like, for example, when you first, when I first moved into the house, do you remember what

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:28.390 --> 1:14:30.938]: 
  That's more fronted.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:30.938 --> 1:14:31.748]: 
  ela tem então

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:49.450 --> 1:14:52.437]: 
  you said you were traumatized him? Oh and I said...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:52.437 --> 1:14:57.449]: 
  You can't you can't walk in you can't be an animator because you look too fit

 SPEAKER_04 [1:14:57.212 --> 1:15:05.498]: 
  No, no, no, it wasn't that. Shad walked the denial on the couch and he's like, I don't think you'll make it to the winter. And he walked out. That fucking truck.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:03.962 --> 1:15:10.054]: 
  That fucking traumatized Nile. He was like destroyed by that.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:15:11.033 --> 1:15:18.593]: 
  You carry like loaded bullets. Yeah. And they're like conversations. No, but Nyland's proof of salary is right. There's what we need. So you can't.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:15:17.294 --> 1:15:24.449]: 
  That's what I mean. So you kind of do that. Then you gauge people react. Then you kind of get some kind of freedom. I don't think you'll be able to do the literature.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:21.934 --> 1:15:28.178]: 
  I don't think you'll fit through the winter. You know what this is like? It was September too. No, no, no. Do you know what this is like?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:15:24.449 --> 1:15:46.504]: 
  This is like September 2nd. No, no, no, no. Do you know what this is like? Because think of it this way. Nile was probably a really big fan of you. Because he was like a big fan of your art. And then you come in, you're like a wise old man in like a cave. And then this guy who's been trying to meet you for years, you're like, he's like, he sits down and is like really excited and you see him, you're like, you will die. You leave. That's it. That's it. Like he's just like waiting for you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:44.530 --> 1:15:48.445]: 
  Like he's just like- I just love how he- like he's like a fly like-

 SPEAKER_04 [1:15:46.504 --> 1:15:47.145]: 
  Maybe it was like a...

 SPEAKER_04 [1:15:48.445 --> 1:15:51.617]: 
  You'll drop up in the winter with the rest of a wicked insect.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:15:51.314 --> 1:16:02.940]: 
  Let you go in the other room and you just sit there laughing. Because then he actually thinks you're serious. But isn't it more like interesting to actually kind of get genuine emotions out of people to get past like their fakeness? Yeah, no, no. Just-

 SPEAKER_04 [1:15:53.558 --> 1:15:55.448]: 
  It doesn't actually make sense.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:16:02.940 --> 1:16:05.303]: 
  cut right to it, just cut to the bone.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:03.700 --> 1:16:22.448]: 
  just cut to the bone because you can like kind of see what they're really about what they're made out of yeah a lot of people like they they're not gonna be honest with you they'll build they'll build up a wall to cry and try and create their um like they'll have this facade and it's just because they want to look better than what they really are but then I think that makes you look

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:08.003 --> 1:16:09.049]: 
  Maybe I don't

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:09.825 --> 1:16:10.534]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:12.930 --> 1:16:13.285]: 
  No meu Campeão Nacional de coaster.uveu

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:18.516 --> 1:16:18.567]: 
  MBC 뉴스 이준범입니다.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:16:18.567 --> 1:16:19.208]: 
  and then it's your turn.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:22.448 --> 1:16:28.455]: 
  more pathetic though because once you do if you it's like a house of cards you tap it with your finger it explodes down you know what what's

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:27.814 --> 1:17:03.758]: 
  You know what, once you know someone has a facade, it's almost as ridiculous as somebody holding a cardboard cutout of themselves in front of them. Like they're walking around like, this is me, this is me. You're trying to look around. It's not reserved to single people. Everybody is like a performer and then whatever they are, second. A doctor is a performer first and a doctor second because he looks exactly like a doctor should be. He talks like a doctor should be. He's a doctor. He wants to show society, I'm a doctor. So he purposely behaves in some way. You wouldn't want a doctor to walk in like drunk off his ass like smashing beer bottles, being like let's do this opera.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:34.058 --> 1:16:39.981]: 
  in front of them. Like they're like walking around like this is me, this is me. It's like fucking your trail. It's not reserved to like...

 SPEAKER_04 [1:16:57.396 --> 1:16:58.476]: 
  to some way.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:58.476 --> 1:16:58.493]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [1:17:03.370 --> 1:17:13.613]: 
  I just be like, I think he means like the doctor's like, yo, you check out the new family values thing. Like, you know what I'm saying? That's not it. He'd walk and be like, so anyways, the age is killing you? You also wouldn't want to think it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:06.745 --> 1:17:09.276]: 
  You're not doing that. You're not doing that. I'm saying that.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:08.500 --> 1:17:08.939]: 
 うそよ

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:11.622 --> 1:18:12.507]: 
  You also wouldn't want it like it's always portrayed in like cartoons like this But you also want to want a doctor coming in cracking jokes at something horrible Like if he was like hey, you got a brain tumor, but guess what you know your brains gonna be twice as big now Yeah, so you probably wouldn't can you or being a smartest guy? It's like I have a fucking brain tumor dude It's like I don't care about your comedy fucking routine Well, like let's say take a Chris for example You'd expect him to like behave a certain way like for example a guy would have to behave that he has like a million Subscribers or something he would be kind of stuck up about it or kind of posh about it I just have like a certain he would have he'd be like at one of those youtubers He would carry that's what you'd expect him to be like because he would have to put on that act to meet that standard But he's not you'd have a strap with your like million like gold thing on your back You'd be carrying it everywhere you go She just have a tattoo that says like one mill like one mill with a white T logo I don't know what I mean, but there are people who are like they are genuinely people

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:56.372 --> 1:20:24.267]: 
  Oh, because of the jacking off thing. Jacking off pissing in someone's head. The pissing bothered them? Well, yeah. You went to a school where they had a spit hole, and they played come-of-the-piss kit. Obviously. No, a super slump. You know what? A lot of my videos, it's weird. So I started off not that bad, and I gradually get worse. So every time I make a new video, they're just like, yeah, that's about expected by now. So at first they were kind of like, You're lowering the bar for your parents. The more horrible I get, the less they seem to care.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:05.772 --> 1:20:07.290]: 
  That was a biscuit. That was a joke.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:20:19.424 --> 1:20:20.031]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:22:26.695 --> 1:22:48.312]: 
  I have a question and this is genuine. I genuinely have a question. Do you feel awkward when somebody... Not farts, but when somebody asks you a question, it's a question you really don't care about. I went into the sports bar, right? Or a sports cut place, where you get your hair cut. And the first thing, since it's a sports place, they were like, so you like sports?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:34.491 --> 1:22:35.959]: 
  not farts but when somebody else

 SPEAKER_00 [1:22:41.612 --> 1:22:42.051]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:22:44.397 --> 1:22:44.414]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:22:49.122 --> 1:23:05.963]: 
  and then you can't be like, oh I like soccer, what's your favorite team? or I like football and what's your favorite team? you're just like, you know I watch it, they know you're bullshitting it but do you ever feel weird whenever someone like you have to know what sports are? you have to care about sports?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:22:55.163 --> 1:22:55.568]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:00.867 --> 1:23:01.238]:

 SPEAKER_04 [1:23:04.748 --> 1:23:31.444]: 
  I've never I've never I've never in my life been interested in these four I've taken done a lot of sports And I look if I had to choose between like watching football or playing football you'd rather just to me to me Honestly, you know, it's like and I I'm nothing That'll be this like a pretentious fucking like all looking you kind of way But to me sports are like the average person's let's play Yeah, it's like I could rather play a video game or watch me play video game I can either play sports or watch me play sports. That's true. That's actually shit

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:24.441 --> 1:23:24.627]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:23:24.627 --> 1:23:24.812]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:23:37.789 --> 1:23:55.643]: 
  when I was you that's really good way to put it because it basically is a game but yeah I you're watching it and it's right now I think that was the that was the likening of it it was like you know oh there's a stigma about you know watching people play a game but it's like you know you're watching people play soccer somewhere else halfway across the world you're not fucking plane

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:41.451 --> 1:23:41.721]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:23:54.900 --> 1:23:57.769]: 
  and you're watching it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:23:56.841 --> 1:24:18.947]: 
  You're watching it's for visual stimulation. It's also for like, you know, the stakes are high or you see a cool moment Or you catch like that thing that happens. I will say genuinely though I do like watching hockey occasionally because I like seeing them throw down It's kind of exciting. They beat the shit out of each other whenever they get the chance. Yeah, that is very enjoyable It's like watching like ice wrestling. It's interesting. Ice wrestling? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:25:36.387 --> 1:25:38.445]: 
  von hier gaat até isso

 SPEAKER_03 [1:25:38.445 --> 1:25:47.288]: 
  Yeah, I thought there was some I thought it was like the she like she like broke the leg or broke the legs of her competitors or her competitor

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:47.288 --> 1:25:49.549]: 
  I thought someone ran up to her and broke her legs.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:25:49.499 --> 1:25:52.755]: 
  Oh, because she didn't want, they didn't want her to win or something? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:51.810 --> 1:26:21.089]: 
  Yeah, I forget anyways, you know We talked about this before where We're done sport. What's that? SPO or TZ. Yeah, what is that sport? When you have a sport and this is sporta I don't mind when people watch sports and they're like casual about it And they're just looking at it and it's like oh, okay, that's good that person one I like that and but did you think it's kind of like really horrible when people get obsessed with watching sports as if No, then they have a riot

 SPEAKER_03 [1:26:01.716 --> 1:26:03.454]: 
  Yeah, it was so sparky.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:26:05.007 --> 1:26:06.053]: 
  This is Forta.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:06.053 --> 1:26:07.352]: 
  I don't mind when people watch this.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:26:19.604 --> 1:26:26.100]: 
  Look, and then they have a riot and burn down their entire city, either if they win or lose, they'll do it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:25.004 --> 1:26:28.176]: 
  Why are they so obsessed with it like that?

 SPEAKER_04 [1:26:27.771 --> 1:26:50.451]: 
  Because look, we all, everybody in this room has something, probably the people listening to the, if you're a person who listens to a podcast, chances are you're not probably that kind of sports person, maybe you are, I don't know. But we all have other stimulation in different ways, right? Like you'll watch a TV, you watch Breaking Bad or something. We have obsessions and stuff like that. That's all they have. But to me like... They take every obsession and interest you have and follow it and do one thing. But to me like...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:48.831 --> 1:26:55.868]: 
  and follow it and do one thing. I'm not just like fucking like tippy a car over a fucking religion, it's like

 SPEAKER_03 [1:26:54.349 --> 1:27:01.774]: 
  It's like religion for some people is a way to connect with other people. It's a way to be a part of something.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:58.180 --> 1:27:15.831]: 
  Yeah, but it's completely something. There's these like absolutely just waste of space who get so obsessed and they're like talking about it like Like they talk about the sport and the team as if like they're managing them. They're on it. Yeah, and it's like dude you need to fucking just kill yourself. You're just you're not at contributing

 SPEAKER_03 [1:27:10.094 --> 1:27:11.747]: 
  Did I care on it? Yeah, and it's like...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:27:14.498 --> 1:27:26.378]: 
  not at contributing.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:27:21.164 --> 1:27:22.598]: 
  That's what I'm saying. Where there are people who

 SPEAKER_04 [1:27:22.598 --> 1:27:22.767]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:27:25.298 --> 1:27:27.779]: 
  Oh, that's my point, it's like...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:27:27.492 --> 1:27:36.014]: 
  Everybody does that to a certain degree. Yeah, I don't mind people casually watching it or whatever, but like people get absolutely like violent all over it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:27:34.140 --> 1:27:45.869]: 
  I find it funny that there's like next level stuff like it also isn't the same being as let's players where there's like Fan leagues where they create like right fan the fan team. It would be like it

 SPEAKER_02 [1:27:44.890 --> 1:27:49.446]: 
  It would be like it's people people have a person in Elvis to something that's not exactly but it's like it's

 SPEAKER_03 [1:27:47.894 --> 1:27:50.492]: 
  I don't know exactly but it's like it's the same

 SPEAKER_04 [1:27:49.446 --> 1:27:59.453]: 
  It's the same concept. Chad, you and I had a... You were kind of involved with the subversive later. I had a DV at Darn a couple years ago. Yes, yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:27:58.373 --> 1:28:00.989]:

 SPEAKER_04 [1:28:03.334 --> 1:28:10.945]: 
  He didn't even use what he used today, which is the bizarre part. He used Shad's. He was a variation of Shad's, usually. Like a weird or... His name was the shape man.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:28:08.093 --> 1:28:17.475]: 
  Like a weird He thought your name was shade. I know you felt it wrong. Yeah, so he's they would shade band

 SPEAKER_01 [1:28:10.945 --> 1:28:16.007]: 
  He thought your name was Sheet. I know. He thought you spelt it wrong. Yeah, so his name was Sheet.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:28:15.501 --> 1:28:19.872]: 
  So he's named with Shadeband, but he knew better. So he knew better. What the fuck is going on?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:28:17.475 --> 1:28:23.939]: 
  But he knew better. So he smelled it right. What this guy would do is he would pause frames of videos of mine.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:28:23.939 --> 1:28:30.334]: 
  bring this over to photoshop or flash whatever trace these but he wouldn't even trace it well he would trace it badly like

 SPEAKER_03 [1:28:31.127 --> 1:28:33.338]: 
  Take his own liberties with him.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:28:32.359 --> 1:28:44.712]: 
  Yeah right, so for example I think he like took what character he just took the hair off. Yeah, yeah. He just made what a character's bald. He knew better. Yeah, yeah, he was like, yeah, fuck it, he'll be doing better. But so this kid was probably 13, 14, and he clubs up the Shave Man, so it was me.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:28:36.561 --> 1:28:38.367]: 
  Yeah, yeah. You can speak when the couch is bald.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:28:45.454 --> 1:28:52.508]: 
  So you'd be like, hey, do a video or whatever. But what? But the bizarre part was when I scrolled through the comments and I found this person I can't remember.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:31:09.516 --> 1:32:43.999]: 
  It's like you're friend. It's like he had a friend who's like, I'm really afraid of heights, okay? And so you fuck with him one day. He's asleep and you put his bed at the edge of something really high and then you fucking put an air board to his face and then you're like holding him so he sees it so he wakes up and he pisses himself. It's just human nature. You know the best way to get somebody is to get the biggest fear in itself. See I'm doing the opposite. I would take his bed and I would put it in a beautiful forest and I would cook him breakfast and I would tap him on the head and say, hey sleepyhead. He was still screaming because he had a horse. He's coming fucking set up these little shit. You're not a real friend if you don't push him off the top of a building. Alright guys, well we gotta wrap this up. It's getting a little bit late. Shad, thank you so much for joining us and sharing your unbelievable story. Dude, I had no idea about all the details of it. It was literally amazing. That is actually, you said before that it was kind of Kafka. That is a very, very bizarre Kafka story that you told. But again, thank you so much. I really hope that we have you on the show more if you're down. We'd love to have you. Because you're here. I have a lot to talk to with this guy. Good. Yeah, we could fill up a little bit. Then folks back home, they don't need to ask when the next Shad episode is coming out. They just need to know there's going to be plenty more. Cory's playing us out right now. Thank you guys for joining. Thank you. Good luck guys. Hey plug your Twitter.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:31:38.963 --> 1:31:40.448]: 
  Let's see, I'm doing the opposite.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:31:48.126 --> 1:31:52.328]: 
  He was still screwed because he was fucking set up with shit.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:32:07.431 --> 1:32:09.473]: 
  That is literally amazing.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:32:23.361 --> 1:32:25.082]:
