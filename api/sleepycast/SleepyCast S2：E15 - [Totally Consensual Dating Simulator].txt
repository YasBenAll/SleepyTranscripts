 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:00.497 --> 0:00:23.346]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:23.144 --> 0:04:59.539]: 
  Welcome to Sleepycast, I'm on Sleepycast. Can I take your order? I've joined here with my friend Chris. Hello everybody. And my other friend, Nile. And we're just gonna have a wholesome episode. We're just gonna keep this one a laid back kind of... Just friends embracing each other's company. Oh, so put on your headphones and... Cory, you're grabbing your little fat tummy? You said something that I realized still happens to me. What? You said when you go down the stairs, your tits don't flap. Mine still do. You told that to Cory as well. I tweeted it. My nipples do those weird things and like old... Those old meet-and-fuck games for niggas. Meet-and-fuck. Like the nipples move down whenever they fuck, but they're like the tits stay in the same spot. Yeah. That's what my tits do. It's like you've like connected... Your nipples are like they just slide up and down your tits. He's talking about the animation where it seems like someone's connected like an invisible wire to the nipples and it's just moving the wire up and down so the whole tit faces that one point. Meet-and-fuck was such a horrible concept. You like play a game and then you just you click parts so she's like, no! And then you find like her left thigh and she's like, mm-hmm. And then you rub it and then she gets pissed off and you have to rub her shoulder and she's like, mm-hmm. Just keep doing it. I have never heard of you. Where's the skip button? You've never heard of me know. Yeah, no, he's completely right. It's like it always starts off where it's like, let's get down to it. And then like you'll click on her shoulder. She'll be like, no! And then you click on her other shoulder. It's like a real girlfriend. She'll be like, yeah. Exactly. You click one side, she gets pissed off, but you click the other. She's totally fine with it. Who made these? Just some guy, I don't know. She's like this most basic idea. It's like a series? Yeah, it was loads of... I think I got horny to one or two of them. Are they like real characters? Like are they characters? No, they're anime. Just like these like bimbo old flashy style anime characters. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, it was always the same. It was always like you can't start with the pussy or the tits. You always got to start with like their arms or their thighs. And if you click the left one, she'll probably be like... For why? You have to like massage them first? Yeah, the hand like rubs up and down. Yeah, you have to move the mouse and hold it up and down. I remember playing a bunch of those flash games. It's a good topic. You're talking about like old porn games? Yeah. You know, there's like this weird like Uso. I don't know if you ever played that where it's like you press a collect point and then you go down to like another point and you kind of like follow it. It was like, first of all, it was the hardest fucking porn game. I just wanted to see her panties. And they're forcing me to do all this stuff just to move her leg. It's like... Sex games in general are really weird. Oh, I remember there was this one and it was like an ad on porn websites. And they said they advertised it as the second life of sex. So I got it. And in the like videos of it, like there was like big demon guys fucking girl. I thought it was so cool. So I clicked on it and it was like, it was nothing. It's just one of my... It was like, enter all your credit card details. It's always like 3D ads. It's just like... Yeah, it was like the IMVU or InVU or... Yeah. You say that IMVU. I had IMVU. I only had it for a day because I thought it would be cool like second life, but it wasn't as fun. IMVU is malware. Yeah, it was just like malware. You can't delete it. It's like, if you delete it, it's like there's still... It's still open somewhere on your computer. I like last year bought a sex game. Really? Yeah, 3D one. I thought it would be cool. What was it? I'm just interested to see what it was. Yeah. I forget what it was called, but it was like... It starts off in this like, white room, and then there's like a girl with really, really cool, titty physics like running on the spot. Her clothes are like, are like rag doll cloth. Yeah. And it had really, really good collision detection. So her like shirt wasn't clipping through her tits. Oh, really? I was like, this is really impressive. But then when it got to the game, it was like... Wait, was it actual game where you don't... No, the whole point is that like, you're supposed to paste these so you start off and you're like, I just want to fuck people, but you got to go through all this bullshit first so that when you finally get to the fucking, you're like, yes! But the game starts off and it's like, you're in a gym and you're like working for some bitch who has huge titties. And she's like, pick up all the cans off the ground and you're like, fine. But every time I did it, it took like 20 minutes to walk from like where you pick up the can to the trash can and drop it into the can with the shitty fucking rag doll physics. And then I got really fucking mad and I turned it off and I never played it again. So you have to earn the sex in a sex game. That's what it was. Back then, there was these like really complicated sex games. There was another one where there was a girl that was passed out on the toilet and it was like she was put, she had her clothes on. Unearthed Nile's memories. Oh my God. Nile just, he just like hit with all these numbers. Dude, I remember, oh my God, I remember this game I got and it was called like Jenna Jamison's porn game or something. Oh my God, I remember getting it on Lime Wire and... Jenna Jamison's. I put it on DVDs and I sold it to my friends in school. Nile, you're so old. And that's piracy. That's piracy. Yeah, when I was like 14. It's piracy, man. I remember this and then you could like grab their legs and open them and it's like, you're like a porn director in it and you just take pictures. They're just basically just like 3D models that you like move around. You know what I like? And then you click fuck and then it's just some really bad animation you guys looking. You know what I like about the game that I got though? It's like it was all really technically amazing, like the rag doll titties and shit. Anyone can remember that game, please tell me. But the sound effects were like recorded in the kitchen. So it's like, you see this really good 3D model, but then you hear like noise come in like... And then you hear like... Like a cat walking by.

He's like, yo man I had to fucking hack Russian service to get this fucking shit. I got on limer and he he fucking had like he had it was Insane I played it and I was blown away by all the options me too because they had they had everything you could do anything Everything you make fat girls. Yeah, you can make you can fucking you can make traps you can make anything You make traps. Yeah when I was like this one was like because I'm my one you can have different scenes And you could there was like specific created animated scenes where they would talk and be in position and stuff Yeah, but then there was one so you could just rig where you were in a room and you had a million poses to choose Yeah, don't oh man. That was so good. You know how much they charge for that stuff normally It's like 90 bucks for the game and like for like packs. It's like I think it's like $30 for the game You get like a free trial, but the packs are like $90 and you get like there's hundreds of packs It's like oh sci-fi adventure by them to star wars. Yeah all this shit You know it's like this in weird though It's like these like sex games are created by like small teams of people usually right But they've got like the most amazing like physics and they're super stable and they're like, you know technically impressive and shit And all these big budget games don't have any of the features that these games like I don't mean the sex parts I mean like the actual physics Why don't they fucking do like incorporate some of this is a real games where it's like you run up to someone Just like rip their fucking clothes off and tear it and throw it on the ground Okay, you ever noticed that all these new games are so fucking blind It's just the same sandbox like you're in a city where like people don't really do anything except get mad at you for no reason And push you and keep walking. It's like why can't you just run up to people like I don't know fucking rip their shirt off and throw it On the ground and have them get mad

  Okay, just do that in real life.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:56.264 --> 0:12:44.547]: 
  I don't mean to rape people out of your cars. I mean this would be cool if that would be hey you hearing that 3d sex About what I'm not talking about right? I'm talking about that's what I would do. I'm I would go to a woman reading a paper I push her over and pull her fucking shit up like you do not find yourself playing games like I remember like they're doing Games like on a computer where like there'd be curtains on the wall you probably rip them off You're like hey, and you just feel cool doing it because it looks cool and simulations are always fun to do I love simulating. Yeah, like bussing games ever use those No, and it's like well, I mean they do but not cool. It's always just like a curtain on the wall you walk through You wish you had more options because it's like and those are always kind of like after thoughts for a lot of people like they need A room so they throw in some they put in some squares and then color it later Yeah, like a clock or something But it's like you would just want to go up to and just fucking like smash out a window or rip off some fucking curtains The division is supposed to be good for that again Really the division has like but you know glass it like breaks the glass exactly really realistically if you like shoot a bed You want to see like feathers and shit that happens and there's still holes like that look like It's what needs to happen when you play like oblivion You can like go into someone's house and knock all the shit off their shelves and leave them the ground You know I'm doing two years later and it's still all broken I gotta love that shit and oblivion is fucking broken as I hope but it's really fun We can do that. Do you know the scroll trick where you can like spawn a million scrolls? Oh you pull back on the arrow you pull back on the arrow And you like double click on something in the menu and you close the menu like a million watermelons like appeared I did that in Skyrim except with cabbages You press like P or something and then a cab just goes bop and then like you could do like millions like bop bop bop bop That shit is so fun. You know why it's fun? It's because there's a million fucking watermelons clogging up a room and it's like a simulation and it just looks sweet The NPCs are still just like trying to walk to the door and you're like smashing through them Like that's not fun That's what I spend like all these big fucking games like watchdogs and Grand Theft Auto They have these big worlds with nothing to fucking do in it I know I want to go to the top of a building and grab the throttle drop a watermelon onto a car and watch it blow up Just cause kind of like that though. Yeah, just cause too was way better Yeah, I played two in your house like years ago with oblivion me and my Brother used to play oblivion and that's all we would do. We would never follow the rules Once we got out of the city we went into the city. They're like you're gonna go to the tournament And my brother's like hold on. I'm just gonna make a bunch of scrolls and then Make the buy the sword oblivion is a shitty ass game. Well, it's not okay. It's shitty, but it's also brilliant. It's old It's really dated but it had all these things you could do that were just so fun Like you could go to people's houses and like pickpocket them and yeah It had all that in skyrim too. I know but oblivion came out like 10 years before that shit This is like 10 years before Skyrim is like like now like oblivion is like how's that like, you know that sky circle air box Yeah, like you're in like a little city. You have to still have your seat like everything It's very simple. I'm just saying at the time when oblivion came out it did all this shit that I've never seen It seemed really cool Yeah, like I don't I got a new computer recently and I downloaded skyrim and uh I just downloaded a load of mods. I didn't know what they were. I just loaded mods And then like the guy comes up to me and he's like you've committed crimes against skyrim and his people And then like it next it just cut to him fucking me Like Other mods all the mods to find that one and turn it off And then like I know when I turned it off it broke the game So like it worked with like another I couldn't play it for like a month I installed mods if you're correctly or not using the actual thing you're supposed to install it So you installed like 400 dick mods and tinny mods and fuck mods and I played a little bit in my game Which is crashing and fucking I couldn't get anywhere stupid as shit ever so dumb Why would a policeman get mad at you and then rape you? And that was like the punishment Skyrim go to jail. I fuck you. You just had to fucking me. Why would he bother saying that? Why wouldn't you just start with the race? The rest of my character was the kajii. It was like a cat and it was just like I just looked weird and the animation was terrible Oh, yeah The animations are like I'm so stiff. They're like, yeah, they're just like one thing and your character's just like Do you remember when that when people were hacking gta online and people were doing news reports about it? Where they're like people can virtually rape you and then you just see like it's very realistic and graphic And you just see like this fucking gta character like clip behind the guy really shittily They're like bend over shiddly and just like clip into him over and over This is like a cone and shit and it's like losing their shit over it and almost crying because he was a fucking idiot It was this heavy woman with like green hair and she was like I can virtually raped on one Yeah, he's like he's like laying it like the car drives away and he's still in the same spot with a cone over his head while he fucks The video was so funny. I tried to mod the fuck out of sims 3 and I'm really I think sims 3 is really good Love sims they fuck sims 4 sims 4 garbage Strip it like down sims 3 had a lot of like really crazy sex mods you go like okay, like you know suck my dick She got on there and she like could take the dick she'd be like Matt when I was like, that's not made by me when I was like 12 I had the sims one and I figured out that no I had the sims living it up expansion pack And when I figured out that mod where you can literally pick up anything you see you could pick up fire and put it on sims But no I figured that you could pick up the blur around the sims in the shower You can just move it and then you can just look at their tits, but they don't have nipples or a pussy Oh, yeah, just the mull. I got so fucking horny I was like that was the horniest I ever was at that point. Yeah, there's just where you can get rid of it That that was yeah, you could pick up the blur and just move it somewhere. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's what I did There's a code for um that was sims 2. I think no it was one It was a sims one where you you're with your mom and she's like forces you to get a job Or you like gonna move out or something ps2. Yeah. Yeah, I didn't play. I was the sims one on ps2 I learned the fisheye code for that. Yeah, see people without the mosaics In first person, so I'd walk up to them really creepily while they're in the shower. Yeah Just sit one up. Yes

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:40.506 --> 0:11:43.425]: 
  Sims 4 is garbage. They stripped it like down.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:50.985 --> 0:11:53.415]: 
  That's what I was like. It's not me, but it's me. That's what I was like.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:10.510 --> 0:12:11.961]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:36.075 --> 0:12:36.497]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:36.497 --> 0:12:37.307]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:42.589 --> 0:12:46.825]: 
  Yeah, this is one of PS2 was fucking shit

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:45.660 --> 0:13:02.856]: 
  I guess it was basically like a raped like Sims 2 not raped. I mean strips. Sorry. Yes, no It was you couldn't even have two story houses. It's like look at my match bungalow It's like shit and then when you try to build a house It was just the most awkward clunky shit and it wouldn't let you put too many things on screen or a crash Yeah, remember the fucking herbs?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:50.284 --> 0:12:51.398]: 
  Yes, you can do it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:54.520 --> 0:12:54.975]: 
  That's like it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:04.206 --> 0:13:06.450]: 
  It came with the fucking stupidest.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:06.450 --> 0:13:23.444]: 
  You don't remember the fucking earth like the punk rock girl on the front It's like when they try to make Sims hip you don't remember the fucking it was the Sims in the city I didn't fucking the ad for it was all my Oh my god I'm starting it here Freshman is starting it here That memory was at the back of my head I'm ready to leave you know when I worked in GameStop

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:07.227 --> 0:13:07.446]: 
  You don't know what I'm talking about.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:15.867 --> 0:13:20.237]: 
  Oh my god! Freshman is starting in here! Freshman is starting in here! That man!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:23.444 --> 0:13:25.941]: 
  All we ever fucking had pre-one was fucking herbs and

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:25.941 --> 0:15:03.006]: 
  thief because nobody wanted that. It's the worst thing I've ever. My favorite thing though was the Sims and hot dates and uh... That's what I was thinking. Professional working, where you can like actually go to like a restaurant and work there and move to, and like while people are sitting you can take them out of their chair and put them outside the middle of the road. I had the Sims, I had the Sims living it up, the Sims uh, hot date. I had the Sims house party which was sweet. Oh yeah. The penning just dropped. Is hot dating like kind of like the sex game? You could take your girl out on the town. Yeah, when you got the hot time machine, you need to do it. The hot time machine? Yeah. Fuck you. You can come back with all your friends from your comedies and fuck. You know what's really fucked up? What? Someone had to remake that Let's Get It Started and they had to remake that in SimTalk for that ad. Oh it was like... That was... No yeah it was like... Like someone got paid to do that. Someone wasted their life doing that. You think they had a script so you have to say... There's a whole language you have to learn for Sims. Is it real though? It's a professional language. It is not. It is just too much. No, I read something when I was looking something up. It's made from like 18 different languages. It's actually like a cleric tongue that you have to learn in order to do it. That's why everybody does it. It sounds very professional when they're talking because they're actually reading specifically designed words around this idea. Oh that's why I was wondering if it was just someone like Chris who could just do it. Yeah, because if they were to copy a language that sounded like something somebody would remember, people would be like oh it's German. It just sounds like really basic baby talk. It is. Oh la da da da. Oh. Chris is really good. Yeah, I can do this. No, it's not hard to be good at that. It's just think of the shittiest, most basic baby word. The only thing I can think of is... Bye.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:27.072 --> 0:13:29.485]: 
  The worst ever

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:32.910 --> 0:13:33.450]: 
  That's what I was thinking.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:33.450 --> 0:13:33.737]: 
  Thank you for watching.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:41.078 --> 0:13:43.002]: 
  Put him outside the middle of the road.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:47.440 --> 0:13:48.317]: 
  Oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:52.755 --> 0:13:55.067]: 
  It was when you got the hot t-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:59.860 --> 0:14:01.362]: 
  your comedies and fuck

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:09.209 --> 0:14:12.449]: 
  That was... No, yeah, I was like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:19.165 --> 0:14:22.304]: 
  There's a role language you have to learn.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:22.995 --> 0:14:23.451]: 
  It is.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:23.451 --> 0:14:25.122]: 
  thougt- is! no- they ain'tok

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:29.982 --> 0:14:31.028]: 
  Does that structure?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:40.613 --> 0:14:41.406]: 
  on this idea.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:43.414 --> 0:14:43.988]: 
  Yeah, because it's...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:45.254 --> 0:14:45.945]: 
  A language.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:50.012 --> 0:14:52.139]: 
  It just sounds like really basic baby talk.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:55.935 --> 0:14:56.644]: 
  Yeah, I can do that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:00.492 --> 0:15:01.673]: 
  The only thing I can think of is the lipstick baby words.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:03.006 --> 0:15:12.439]: 
  who ballastara boys though. Yeah, you're just going, balla haqqaibba. Balla haqqaibba.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:12.439 --> 0:15:24.167]: 
  Don't think of it this feeling that's a good When you want to go somewhere I would assume say I want you to fuck me up my asshole up. He's seen it for you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:14.481 --> 0:15:19.830]: 
  Yeah, that's when you're confident. Dushino! Oh, no! You say Dushino when you want to go somewhere.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:25.045 --> 0:15:34.950]: 
  German I can't I do German as well. I just I just go high school stupid ties For you if you were a Sam and you were about to uh get fucked

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:25.551 --> 0:15:27.002]: 
  I do German as well.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:27.002 --> 0:15:27.829]: 
  I just wanna be serious.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:35.963 --> 0:15:38.005]: 
  Jacino! Jacino!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:37.769 --> 0:15:41.346]: 
  What are you doing learn all

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:42.342 --> 0:18:51.173]: 
  AHHHHHHHHH They can't just scream either, they can't just, oh they can't even put it in, it's like AHHHHHHHHH It's like really goofy screaming What's the mean of this thing you've ever done to a sim? Like, like, oh I was just thinking, like, um, do you remember the sims living it up? Yeah I'm not sure if you could do it in the first game, but when I had the sims living up, I placed fire on top of a little boy So, like, you pick a fire, like, no, this is how it worked, right? You can either light your stove on fire somehow, but I never did that I just, there was a firework toy that you can like make it shoot up in the sky With the second it hits the ground, pause the game, and there'll be a fraction of a second of an explosion You can pick up that explosion and put it on someone And do they- They'll go on fire and just die Really? That's amazing Yeah, and that game freaked me out because when I was a kid, um, like, the Grim Reaper would come when you die And, like, it'll play Rock, Paper, Scissors with you to see if you can have your life back But if you have your life back, they'd, like, turn the color of your skin green so you're like a zombie Yeah, I remember that And I think they renamed you like Zombie Chris or something Yeah, I know It was just fucking weird Yeah, and it's really weird The character's not the same either, it's like Did they take that out now? Like, I remember there was one point where, like, I remember this and it pissed me off because There was these one assholes, because I think it was the one where it's like, you know, living it up or something Where you had to actually, like, go out and get a life and, like, join people So I had a family of, like, four people and I'm like, why do I have to put food on a table for these pieces of shit? Because I couldn't interact with them at all So I came up with the genius plan of putting them in a room and taking away the door and windows so they can't get out Yeah But these motherfuckers created a loony-tune cartoon hole on the ground and jumped through and jumped back up Yeah Really? Yeah And then they went over to the fridge and got a sandwich and I was so fucking mad Because once they're dead, I check back and I'm like, yeah, you fucking in your piss puddle, you little bitch That's what you get for putting waste of my money I remember you used to kill people by putting them in the swimming pool and taking the ladder out Yeah, that was another way, yeah I don't know how they, it was a really bad game design But they took it out in three because if you die in three, you die But you can become a ghost and there's a lot of ways to come back up I usually just build a square around them so they're stuck with the like, oh, what are you doing? Something like really scary when the burglar would come, remember that? It was, it was scary too when you can't do anything Yeah Like you can't pause, you can't do fucking, you can't stop him Wait, you can't pause when the burglar's there You can pause but it doesn't help, you can't get up Like your characters get up and they just sit there like fucking assholes like Oh no, oh no, like they just like saw a fucking rat on the ground And the fucking burglar is tiptoeing around still in your TV and shit Is you didn't put up a fucking burglar alarm That's something I eventually learned Every time I make a house I always have a burglar alarm Because it's like just important Because your sims are garbage, they can't go up with a baseball bat and try hitting them Actually in Sims 3 you could attempt to wrestle them And if you win, they're like oh, I'm defeated And then the police officer comes in and arrests them Oh weird Why are we talking about the Sims so much? We were talking about mods and Skyrim I think Oh yeah That's how you do conversation, that's how conversations start I just wish, all I wanted to say was I wish more games had new ideas Everything just feels like I agree too I haven't played a game in a long time that felt, do you remember when like Oblivion or when like something like Grand Theft Auto 3 first came out, it was like this is fucking crazy Like when was the last time you felt that about a game

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:50.054 --> 0:15:50.543]: 
  What's the mean of this?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:52.247 --> 0:15:53.192]: 
  What was I thinking?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:16.750 --> 0:16:18.505]: 
  They'll go on fire and die

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:18.505 --> 0:16:19.450]: 
  That's amazing.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:19.450 --> 0:16:19.517]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:31.752 --> 0:16:32.579]: 
  Yeah, I remember that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:34.604 --> 0:16:38.502]: 
  I know this is fucking weird. Yeah, and it's really not the same either

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:38.502 --> 0:16:38.805]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:04.810 --> 0:17:05.164]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:22.174 --> 0:17:22.950]: 
  How do they do this?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:22.950 --> 0:17:23.523]: 
  what's my money?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:25.634 --> 0:17:27.844]: 
  Yeah, I've been taking the letter out. That was another way, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:35.674 --> 0:17:37.514]: 
  I usually just build a wall around someone.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:39.049 --> 0:17:40.922]: 
  Yeah, something like really like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:44.078 --> 0:17:45.310]: 
  It was, it was scary too.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:46.491 --> 0:17:46.964]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:13.137 --> 0:18:13.643]: 
  because you're...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:32.442 --> 0:18:34.382]: 
  It's how conversations start.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:39.546 --> 0:18:40.407]: 
  I agree too.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:49.435 --> 0:18:53.012]: 
  Maybe it's your childhood wonder.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:52.202 --> 0:21:12.197]: 
  It was and it was like all this new every time something came out it felt so like bigger and new but now everything feels smaller I've never really been to when a game comes out. I've never really been excited for a game that much I mean like I don't speak for like Shad who's like an avid gamer I myself am someone who plays games on rare occasions, but for me It's like I recently played that point-and-click interworld game last time I played a point-and-click game was like a remake of Monkey Island. I love that game. Yeah, it was like the one where it's kind of like the almost Disney-esque or old Disney I didn't get very far because it was hard I got my birthday. It was really fun and like the characters really fun and that's what the game is Like you know, it's a very fun point-and-click game very simple very quick and I was having fun with that But you realize that point click games are like there's specific types of point click There's like the ones where it's just like asinine like okay give a monkey marbles He'll throw the marbles at the wall which will unlock a hole in the wall Which shows you the area where you get the stick the specific stick You need to stick into a hole that you completely didn't see to begin with and then you open it and opens up Open passage. Do you remember the old that man in black the men in black a point-and-click game from like No, I had a shit ton of point-and-click and like learning games growing up because like I said I didn't have a gaming console. I had a PC. I had DOS So I had a lot of Windows games. That's sims is virtual Springfield Matt You had all the stuff that as a child I wish I had but I couldn't afford it I just sims is cartoon studio and I had that Casper point-and-click shit that was horrible I think I torrented that when I was like 11. I had this game called Orion burger that like made me really mad Cuz like it wouldn't work I just I've had it since childhood and then it would never work on any computer I ever got and then I finally like tried using it again when I was like 16 unlike my Windows Vista or whatever and still wouldn't work so I smashed it in hand I remember the same sort of thing. I had like a game that just would not play. It was a Lego game for PC It would not play. It was just I wasn't scratched Or man she was a kid because you're like me it's a game. It's a fucking game And it won't work. Yeah, I know it's a big cock tease when you're kid. I got it in a cereal thing Oh, yeah, it was here It came in a plastic bag and it was like it was at the time. It was really cool And I'm like why can't I play this fucking Lego game in my cereal box? This is bullshit I got it on a little CD or anything. It was just a CD I got this Pokemon 2000 game when the movie was coming out in the cereal box I had the trailer and I watched it like 400 million times. I was like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:57.282 --> 0:18:58.750]: 
  But now everything feels smaller.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:16.654 --> 0:19:16.941]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:16.941 --> 0:19:17.954]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:12.957 --> 0:24:48.332]: 
  How excited you get over like getting games and cereal boxes? Yeah, I remember getting my bionicle game in a cereal box. Really lost my shit I love the bionicle games. You know looking at it now is probably a piece of shit I paid I paid 64 euros for bionicle on ps2 by the way 64 euros at the time was like a hundred dollars Yeah, that's not on me and that is one of the worst games I ever played I was so fucking angry and guess what happened I went back to I went back to the store to sell back They wouldn't take it back as I took it out of plastic and guess what the next day I brought it back they had reduced it to 20 euro fucking Extortion bullshit is bullshit Was that one game like King James or something wasn't King James? It's like King's quest King's quest introduced the whole character walking from a point and click thing It opened the door to everything Everybody was making point and click games everybody. There was just tons of fucking points because they're easy to make I remember there was this thing who was uh this actually got popular on the internet There was this honey, not cherry osc. Comic thing. It was like family friendly things and people are like Oh, you put you the best one is sponsored on the tiny that cherry osc. Comic thing And people were finding a way to take like the little stick with honey on it and turn it into a dick and put it in like the girl Honey's mouth and stuff And they're making tons of comics where he had like his little beef stick and it was rubbing on the president's ass Everyone is with a sport You just had all these like random like he's like smiling like an asshole ready to go somewhere like his B Dick and it probably only use the one that wasn't choreographic like the You would search like the feature then you go to the ones that you've been submitted just nothing But buzzing is fucking like stick honey day It was the funniest shit and it's funny because it's like you give people an inch They're going to take a mile. Yeah, totally you allow somebody something gets popular to Create stuff. They're going to abuse it. I tried to abuse it when I was you did Yeah, I would see this and I would be like I can turn that letter I into a cock I'm gonna do that. I did the same thing for a 3d movie maker. It is the same thing for all those other games Your 3d movie maker videos are hysterical. They're so good. Oh fuck. I had a ton I just kept making a bunch like I remember I had this one way I got it because I used to get ideas from online from watching people. There was like it There was like that one like Monster roar thing makes no sense And it was like this like that one fat ugly guy who like tackles him and explodes Yeah, he was like attacking a bunch of people who were sitting and they were like it's very nice out today And then he'd come running in A bunch of them would come and just like they were like blooded shit Like ahhhh It was just real sad effect Was it Nickelodeon 3d movie maker? There was another one that did that. I saved a video of my favorites of like a 3d movie maker I remember doing the Nickelodeon movie maker thing. I had the Simpsons cartoon studio. That was the same shit. Yeah, I had that as well. Except you click and drag him around. Oh, I feel so bad.

  I We're talking about tattoos would you ever get a tattoo? I don't think so I would probably like I'm the kind of guy who regrets anything. Yeah, I see but I probably would regret I am too I'm also stupid, so I do it like power to you if you like tattoos But I think I would regret it no matter what it would just drive me crazy I wouldn't get one on my dick or anything like that. No, I Want to see I thought like those sleeves thing looks really cool for a while But now everyone like now it's like a kind of douchey thing So yeah, I was the guy want to be like on the sole of my foot It would be just a fucking ugly face or some shit Funny it's a good idea you can step on it so people can't see it all the time Even if you're naked that's what people used to do where they would like put their tattoos on their ankles Their parents gonna see it because they wear socks all the time Yeah, I do know that there's certain points in your body where if you get a tattoo it fades really fast Like I think if you tattoo anything in your finger your blood will like carry the ink to the tip of your fingers Oh, it's because you bend your fingers a lot so like this probably I always wondered why we don't like dudes get Hair tattoos. I saw you remember that bald guys You see that picture no this picture of a bald guy and you got like loads of like it looked like he has a shaved head tattoo I look like really you can get a shaved head. Yeah, you can make your head look like that You shaved it instead of it being like like Larry Davis. That's interesting. It's a good idea It is a good idea. It looked balding and it's like why not you can look like a cool Jason's Piercings because tattoos and piercings I had piercings. I want to get a piercing on my banjo string Oh god, that would hurt so that when I have sex with Elena course girls think I'm good at it You want a prince Albert and a can? Cory Cory, that's my name. We're gonna look at some total questions Twitter questions Heartless arts asks how do you connect and make friends in art animation creative communities and what are the do's and don'ts? Oh, how do you make friend? I kind of know how you make friends in the art community Yeah, what would you do and not do the best way to make friends in the art community is to at some point Reach out to them but not be so pushy. Yeah, exactly I if there's artists or any kind of art people out there like if I do something I encourage that like I totally enjoy when people Semi-art of stuff. I may not retweet it or like give it like grandiose attention But I definitely will show my appreciation if that's not kind of what she's asking Like how do you make other friends like-minded like I would say like oh like if you see someone on just Twitter or demon art Something leave them a comment or something and ask them ask them a question And then like if you get into a conversation ask maybe for their Skype And then they have other art friends and they become in their group and that's pretty easy swear Yes, just not be afraid and message them but don't be so pushy. Yeah, just you to Skype But just don't be if the person doesn't want to talk to you don't keep You'll find other that's the worst way to always find our friends if you do Yeah, I've had a lot of experience with people who I open the door to them And they push their bags through and fucking knock me over and set up shop meeting everybody on Twitter recently Every single person I've met most people I meet it's like if you're an artist post your art and if you suck get better Yeah, it's like get post your art still It's like if you want don't stop don't start fucking sending people art and be like hey You need critique me because it's like that's like that's next level shit It's like what you need to do is be like hey I made some art and if it's like how cool and like they respond you just keep doing it But then don't keep doing it don't keep sending them out because they said a word to you You gotta find a fine line where it doesn't become too pushy or just too far away Cory you ever stay over at your friend's house when you're younger and you're both trying to get to sleep But then one of the blanket starts moving really fast You don't know what's going on and you feel kind of a one of him comes out and it suddenly stops me here. I'm go And you're like, oh, I think he was masturbating. Oh No, it's never happened to me happen to me like My friends never No, I've never had a friend masturbate in a room I feel like that's almost like something where it's like brocode like you know Yeah, it's kind of someone it is rude because it's like you're disrupting their peace because You know like five minutes without Jack what they should do is they should be like you wake their jerk off No, you gotta think of it from their perspective where they're like pretty horny or at least go into the bathroom I wonder as he's asleep.

So right so let's say there's a situation unfolding before my eyes where it's like Oh, no, there's a train about to crash halfway through between this station and this station one of the trains is going 60 miles an hour I'm not gonna fucking think I'm gonna run straight to you and be like no quickly What's he gonna? What do you do cuz I wouldn't even trust my answer. That was gonna be like, oh, what's the speed limit? Everyone's death will be on your shoulders now. Yeah, now cuz you didn't figure out the fucking bath problem that your fucking third grade teacher told you The only one I remember is our day teacher was on the train you asshole The only one I won't give me an idea figure out though is the one where it's like Jimmy has two apples Sarah takes one apple away. How much apples does Jimmy have? It's like, oh, I don't know one Yeah, I'm fucking genius. Why don't we get those in fucking school? No, it's hard. No, he's like Samantha has to go to a party. She knows she needs to get so-and-so a gift She knows so-and-so wants this gift. She only has money for this much What should she spend the money on she knows the direction she has to go is sometimes to save time So she only knows has two stores to go to it's like wow And then when you get why don't you fucking not get a gift and just say sorry When you get into high school though, they change it to X and Y Then you write the answer you'd be like that's what I would do like what are you saying is why can't more of the world's problems Be solved with basic baby math. Yeah, exactly when people are like what would do about the situation in Iraq This is really fucked up. Cory's like chick wife two apples

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:09.947 --> 0:36:13.947]: 
  apples from three apples you'll be fine. Just like, I don't know how to say it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:13.947 --> 0:37:29.159]: 
  I don't know what I'm grabbing. It would, it would, okay? Take away one terrace from another terrace. They have one terrace. You take two apples away from my proc. Give the rest to our sisters. Everything will be fine. Exactly. See, you can use it for anything. You're being gunned down. You have a wallet, okay? Persons like, give me your wallet. See, they're like, this is all we want. They're like, give me, no. They're like, give me your wallet. And you're like, hold on. If I give you my wallet, you give me yours. Therefore, I'll have a wallet. Then you get stabbed. Oh, I see, so Rewana was three apples. Essentially. What do you think there's a rarity for? Yeah, they're like, they're catching people on fire, beheading people on national television. You just give them a bag of apples and be like, now you have one apple and they go back and give it to your sisters. So you have two pairs of apples. Well, I just hold it up in the light and see if it's a real apple. Bite into it. It's like, it's all red. Did you ever just write the answers where it's like, why didn't she want the apples to be in there? Yeah, everyone's like, throw them for a loop. Like, you're teaching her the big fucking apple. Throw them for a loop. Big fucking apple. That was like one of the most embarrassing moments of my life was when I was really young. The teacher was like, right, a 200 word essay about what you did over the weekend. And I was just like, it was very, very, very, very, very, and it's the very, like a hundred times, it was like fun. And then I handed it and I thought everyone would be like, ah, but all the classmates just looked at me like I was a fucking alien retired. And the teacher was like, that's really funny, Chris. And I was just like,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:17.609 --> 0:36:19.819]: 
  There's one terrace and another terrace. They have one terrace.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:23.312 --> 0:36:23.363]:

  Like, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:55.493 --> 0:36:56.505]: 
  still a little bit of a horror.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:56.505 --> 0:36:56.843]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:00.167 --> 0:37:05.399]: 
  Yeah, everyone Like, you try to like, throw him for a loop Fucking ass Throw him for a loop Big fucking ass

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:30.137 --> 0:44:33.632]: 
  I just wanted to kill myself. Did you ever get in trouble and have to write lines? That's gal dives. What? Did you ever get in trouble and have to write lines like Bart Simpson? Yeah, I had to do that so many times. I figured out like that two pens together, it's the same distance from like the two lines of the copy book. They can tell when you do that though. So I just taped like five pens together and just wrote like the lines and I don't know what ever. What? There's no way you could hold five pens in your hand. I know, I taped them together, yeah. No, but there's no way you'd be able to write good like that. You can't. Well, I did. What did you do? I taped pens together so you got the lines done five times fast. Oh, a chalk? No, no, it was on paper. Like we have to do it at home. Oh my god, that's genius. Yeah, it was a good idea. My Irish teacher was such a fucking asshole piece of shit, dickhead. I fucking hate it. What'd he do? He's like, go home and write. In 25 pages, why you must not do blah, blah, blah. I forgot what I did. It wasn't worth 25 pages of fucking, I'm sorry for doing this. 25 pages, come on. 25 pages, that is no joke, five hours of work. That is fucking. You stupid fucking asshole. Nothing I did warranted that punishment. What can you say for 25 pages? It was just basically like, I'm very sorry for whatever I did wrong. But it's just like, come on, dude, fuck you. No kid is going to learn from you fucking torturing him like that. I also feel like that's like really barbaric in a way. It's just a waste of time. Like you go to a kid and you tell him, do a 10 page essay on why you're sorry. And then I'd be like, I'm very, very, very, very, very, very good. That's the fucking head. Yeah, the school I went to was like, you see kids like throwing rocks at each other's fucking heads and like scalping each other. And then he punishes me for some, like I was not a fucking bad mean kid or anything. I was probably stupid, right? That was the worst thing I ever did. The worst difference? Like go home and write 25 times why you did you got something wrong in school. Fuck you, you stupid fucking old pink retard. Fuck him. Stupid chubby headed pink retard. He was pink. He was pure pink. School is such a like weird, like, you know, did you ever hear of the Stanford Prison Experiment? No. It's like basically like years ago, they got like two groups of people and they made one random group of people, prison guards, and another random group of people to prisoners and they did for about a week. And like what actually happened was the people who are just playing the role of prison guards actually became like they had superior complexes. Like they felt like they're better than the prisoners. Oh shit. They started treating them like shit. Yeah, no, but these are just two random groups of people. Oh, they were just they weren't even prisoners to begin with. No, no, they weren't even. They were just random people. It was just two random groups of people. But that's what like school is like. Like the two just. Isn't that ex-glee like really badly? Yeah, it started it started becoming like a real thing. I heard about the social experience. I was watching documentaries of like social experiments that go wrong. Yeah. And that was one of them where it was like this band in building basically with just like two groups of people. Yeah, well, like the kids were the teachers and the kids were also students. That's what it's like, though. The kids were teachers. Teachers in school have this weird like I'm better than you think. And when you're a kid, you think they are because they're adults. Then when like we grow up, you're like, what the fuck was that? I think kids usually have a really good grasp of what's morally right. By the time they're like 12. So by the time you're 12, you'll know if a teacher is bullshitting you. And like if a teacher is bullshitting you and getting away with it makes you really fucking hate them. I tell when a teacher doesn't like you because they're they're quick to judge you at any chance they get like, yeah, there's little shitheads right in all that stuff. But when you're just like flat out just being a cunt like kids can tell that like you don't have. You're getting in trouble, though. Like if I got like I fear getting sent now I'd be like the thing is though, you can fuck you fear the first time you had trouble until you get in trouble for the first time. The first time I got a detention, I'm like, this is it. And so if I ever got detention again, I'd be like, oh no. I had detention every every time it was on. I got detention once. Oh really? Yeah. And that's what made it burn even more. It's like I could have gotten the entire way through school without attention. But this stupid other fucking bitch gave me the tension because some asshole talked to me. Oh yeah. Fucking hate teachers. I got I got a detention because I went into class. Well, everybody was quiet. I just got in from school. Like I just came in. It was early and I'm like, sorry, I was late. I said that to her and then she's like detention. I'm like, why? And she's like because you're talking. And I'm like, OK, how's that a problem? And she's like, you're still talking. And then she pointed to the board. It's like, don't talk. And I'm like, I just got in. And so she gave me the attention and she was adamant about keeping me after school. My mom even came and she's like, that's really sneaky thing for you to do. And she was like, still adamant to give me a fucking attention. That one time my mom came to the rescue. One time my teacher threatened me with detention. It was I think I told the story before, but that was the day my mom like, oh, so good. Basically I was like in our class and like everyone's ready to go home. My bag is on my back. Then the teacher is a psycho fat bitch. She turns around points at me like, you threw a nail in my eye. And I was like, excuse me. Yeah. And I was like, no, I didn't. She's like detention. I was like fucking whatever. And I like nail in her. Yeah. And I left. I went out to the car and I was like, I just got the tension because my teacher said I threw a nail in her eye. And my mom was like, Chris, you're such a fucking idiot. You like, what did you do? And I was like, do anything. And my mom's like, you're your little ass. And I was like, mom, go in there right now and just talk to her. My mom's like for fuck's sake, right? She got out of the car and she came back. She's like, she's a fucking psycho. And I was like, I know. And then she didn't give me the tension after what happened. I don't fucking know. Your mom didn't say no. I got suspended a few times as well. Like I was like, you were a fucking asshole. I got suspended. I was a good kid. I was just done. I was good. Yeah. I got suspended because I got this new phone and it was the first smartphone ever. And I was so happy. It cost me 500 euros. I saved up for it. I was like, I was like using it and I was on a school bus and it fell behind a seat. And I was like, shit. And then people were like reaching their hands out and help me get it. And one of the guys stole it and some guys stole it. And I found out like a month later, he stole it. So I stole his phone. Actually, the school knacker stole his phone and gave it to me and goes here. Here's your, here's your come up and I was like, oh yeah. I was like, cool. And then like he told the principal that I stole his phone and I got suspended. He was fine. He was completely like let go. I do not understand. Her suspension is a punishment. Oh yeah. Suspension is great. Well, it's because of your parents, the wrath. You have to face the wrath of your parents. Who cares? Like you're still out of school. Anything's better than that. We had our suspension entailed us going to the sponge factory with retarded people. We had sponges in plastic bags. This was real. What? Yeah. Did I say this on a funny note? Our out school suspension involved us going to a sponge factory with retarded people. And we stuck sponges in plastic bags and then pushed into a conveyor belt. It's actually, it's a miracle that you're as normal as you are. Seriously, your life is weird. You're just standing between all these like pinhead dips. They're really trying to put the sponges in the bag. So you're like, okay, Don. It's the most retarded sentence on the planet. Like trying to put a sponge in a bag. Cory, like sometimes like you're like a randomizer machine where you just generate a sentence in English. This is, it's fact. Okay, it was out school. It was like, I don't know what you call it. It's like after service or something for people. And they needed people because, you know, if it sounds rude, but when you retarded people put sponges, like retarded works on the factory line, they do their job, but they. So they're usually like baggers or sponge workers. Yeah. And I was the person who gave the person the bag, the retarded bag for the sponges. They were different. Yeah. And he would take the, he would take the sponge with us as vacant look on it. So just day you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:31.470 --> 0:37:34.002]:

I still liked it Oh, because no cars went down there. You just walk in like the other days The most depressing you know what this is the most first-worldly problem ever, but I hate tiny sidewalks Me too cuz you're just like squishing people and dodging shit constantly. I don't really notice. It's so annoying Horrible most sidewalks are big like in the cities and stuff They're like two sides, but like the small ones whether against buildings You know, I have like a fucking small one like there was one up there at the White House So to say oh the old house. So yeah, yeah the old house. Yeah, the bank they're going up to the bank There was like this sidewalk that wraps around it. It was puny Yeah, and the building was fucking falling over on one of the buildings was so you like walk under it I feel like you were like shrinking there's barely any sidewalks in America like it's mostly road It's hard to walk anywhere like this country's so designed for driving. It is design It's not in Ireland. It's designed for walking. You were talking about also. I wanted to reiterate that you said something about Um, you take a year off from school.

  That's a doodle-a-doodle-a-doodle.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:18.130 --> 0:56:50.985]: 
  What's a a trill is it? Yeah, it's what flutes do a lot of the time. You can have a major thrill or a minor thrill where a major one be like or a minor is like we did a lot of trills. It's kind of like trills were really popular in jazz band because it was like a stack is like a the kato. You know, like in band, like there's also like whole notes. That's something I learned as a kid. Whole notes is like a four of count. So it's like one, two, three, four. And a half notes of one, two. That's literally all I know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:31.495 --> 0:56:33.368]: 
  It's kind of like, oh, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:38.329 --> 0:56:39.139]: 
  Look at that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:46.868 --> 0:56:47.492]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:52.285 --> 0:59:47.954]: 
  Sustained is a big uh You would you would see black you'd see like nothing but black notes, then you see a white note You have to hold it. It's a sustained note music great. Yeah, I wish I did music in school Yeah, I would have really excelled at it I like to the idea of making music, but I would not even know where to begin because I I don't know how to do that Oh, I don't know how to read sheet music at all. I can just play the trombone man I think if you don't know anything about music the best place to start is a piano Easy as I always want to learn that I think it would be really relaxing Don't you have to learn the piano just learn how music works on a piano and then you'll know how music works We're I remember in band we always had somebody who would play the piano That was always like a big thing We'd have a piano guy or a piano girl and when the piano girl wasn't in it was like the band was just fucking like playing with her Turds, they didn't know what they were doing. Yeah, you need to like follow along to something Yeah, the piano was what everybody follow along so we have your piano guy come in everybody like It's a piano guy and he'd sit down and he'd be like you like I do a little stretch He like make really cool like Jazzy songs, so I was like, oh dude, it's a piano guy It's piano guy, but then the piano girl comes in she's like being like oh, it's fucking piano girl Cory This is a very strange situation Nobody knows unless you're in fucking band, but it's like the piano girl would come in and there's the trumpet girl, too No, she was she was dreadful. She could not play trumpet at all She played the whole note. She was played into her fucking pussy So she's always looking down when she played yeah, and uh, you're supposed to hold your instrument up and fucking like you know sway and get into it she was just like But you could tell she just signed up for jazz band to be in jazz man She actually hadn't she couldn't play and in my opinion if you're in jazz band You should kind of have a pretty good understanding of what notes are and how music is because it's jazz band It's like it's not fucking symphonic band where nobody cares that we'd have one trumpet players Like you know he's a great soloist and then like she would go and she'd be like She'd be like It's like no the teacher be like higher and she'd be like And it's just like now play other notes It's weird has some people just can't like I don't think it's bad it's some people It's just like how she get into jazz. It's just some people like you can tell someone for like 15 years to do something And they just won't be able to do it and it's no one's fault It's just like you just see that a lot worse like I really want to be an artist Draw-and-draw and draw and draw and they'll draw 50 billion times more than anyone you know But they still can't do it. I might be like that with music. I don't know. No, you I'm like that with guitar I play guitar for three years, and I still just can't do it. It's hard. It's really hard.
