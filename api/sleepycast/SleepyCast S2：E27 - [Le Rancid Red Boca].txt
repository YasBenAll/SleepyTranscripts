 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:22.604 --> 0:00:40.440]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own. Impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense. A world enveloped by a seemingly unending ocean of forests. Very deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:40.440 --> 0:01:45.814]: 
  Cabin, and in that cabin. It's a bunch of guys, it's a bunch of bullshit. I think make sure to do the honors of the instrument. Okay, you make, you should- Make sure to put that on to that mic and do a good opening. Dude, this podcast is brought to you by Fat.com. Yeah, do that. This podcast is brought to you by Fat.com.

Yeah, it gets kind of squinty and pig- I didn't look at it. I thought my natural face was pretty squinty. I didn't know. It gets tight. Your face gets tight. It gets tight? It gets tight. Your face actually shrunk by the way. It shrinks. Yeah, like my entire face, it looks like one of those Mitt Romney pictures you see on Twitter where they just shrink his entire face. That's a seven-year-old me. Get up, get up today. What is that? When was the last shrunken face you saw? Tell me the last shrunken face. Hellbenton was alright, buddy. There should be more shrunken head memes. I want to see more drunken heads. I want to see a little small man getting drunken heads. I still don't know.

  It gets kind of squinty and pig-like.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:13.499 --> 0:01:17.447]: 
  I thought my natural face was pretty squinty. I didn't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:20.367 --> 0:01:23.050]: 
  It's like... It's actually short but it's... It shrinks like in...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:27.015 --> 0:01:29.039]: 
  Twitter where they just shrink his entire head.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:30.863 --> 0:01:34.795]:

  What year is that from? Circa 2012? Whenever your dad was born? That's the reason he wanted to like this. That's the reason he wanted to like this. I didn't make it up! Did you see the meme of Kim Kardashian with big buff arms? Yeah. I thought that was Photoshop. Was it Epic Bake? Was that? Was it? Yeah. She could flip her car if she could break through a window. She'd be like the final boss in a John Klein bad damn like 80s film. She would rip her face off. She would be the boss. If you were told to look after her, she would rip your face off. You know that every time she gets fat people call her skim Kardashian? It's pretty fucking mean. That makes no sense! Skim I get it. Get on the skim.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:56.648 --> 0:01:58.437]: 
  That's the reason he won.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:58.437 --> 0:01:59.955]:

Specifically because we did talk about that one, I think it was the fucking creepypasta. Oh yeah. We talked about Trump and that one before he was elected. Oh yeah, we did talk about that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:13.984 --> 0:05:24.430]: 
  It was probably done as an example of what the economy is like. Nile, you know anything can be valuable if you put value on it. Nile, your smile being valuable to me. Yeah. Oh man, thanks dude. Of course.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:48.947 --> 0:07:50.297]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:01.266 --> 0:08:23.777]: 
  She didn't say that she did say that they do like looking at their shit when you're done And I think that's true. I think everyone likes everyone knows but they're just hoping about it Yeah, that's part is everyone's at the dinner table eating. That's the thing and my mom and dad was like what the fuck and I'm just like She's so nice. She spoke up. Yeah pretty much and then I went to my room and

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:08.067 --> 0:08:10.564]: 
  I think everyone does, but they're just hoping about it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:15.306 --> 0:08:16.454]: 
  And I was just like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:17.635 --> 0:08:18.360]: 
  It's so nice.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:21.735 --> 0:08:26.494]: 
  What? What? What did they do with the shit after it's on the shelf? No, no, stop it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:25.532 --> 0:08:52.482]: 
  No, no, no, no, stomp it down the hole. No, they don't. You use your wooden stomping shoes. You stomp it down. That's why they have such big boo. You tap dance all day. You tap dance all day. Yeah, big souls. They don't want to touch the boo. You can do a little dance with it. Yeah, I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna do it. They have a fly swatter, and it is knocking off the shelf in the hole. It's not literally coming out of the toilet like a big shelf. Yes. It's in the toilet bowl. And then a little jet of water shoots it off and explodes this guy.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:29.937 --> 0:08:33.496]: 
  That's why they have such big boobs.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:33.496 --> 0:08:33.885]: 
  That's all.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:53.140 --> 0:09:30.366]: 
  It's fucking, it's legitimately awful. No, no, no, it's sanitary. Yes. How is that more sanitary? It explodes shit to the rim. There's a little button on the side of the toilet where it unleashes a mass of little fruit flies, and they start eating the shit as it flies out. 78 beetles grab it and run away. They run in the hole in the wall. Imagine if that was an old sewer system in Aztec, where beetles will just fucking scatter out of the wall and just carry it away. Then you can do an old tale about a little boy playing inside and they push the button and the mother screams as the beetle sits away. It's like an old German folklore. Like they always have those stories about kids. Don't play in the toilet. No, no, no. I thought the Aztecs like climate change.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:56.380 --> 0:08:56.633]:

  Like they always have those stories about kids

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:29.202 --> 0:09:38.854]: 
  the Aztecs climb to the top of their step pyramid things and chat and just watch them roll down at each step. Like a slinky? Yeah, and then they see how far it goes down and then they like compete with the rest of the Aztecs.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:38.483 --> 0:09:50.211]: 
  And whoever wins gets their head chopped off. Yeah, it's like apocalypto. Did you know back in the old days, instead of water, they used to spit the shit into it like a liquid? They spit? 30 guys would take turns spitting on it. It's disgusting. That is literally disgusting.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:40.204 --> 0:09:41.318]:

Whoa. She's looking. Look at these reactions. These are the real deal. This is the funniest pizza box I've ever seen. There was that. And then I guess the other thing that, I mean, there was a lot of other projects that I ended up doing, but my favorite one was when I got to do something for Nickelodeon and I was directed by Charlie Adler. Just go ahead and explain the drill. And this is what happened, unfortunately, for me. Oh, this is a story like this. Charlie Adler, if you don't know, he is the voice of Red Man Cow and Chicken, Starscream. He's done a bunch of things. You know his voice. Yeah. You've heard it. If you don't, I mean, if you don't know his name, you've heard his voice. And I did a small part in Blaze and the Monster Machines, which is a cartoon on Nick Jr. And so I go into the studio and there's this man, this very powerful looking older gentleman with white short hair. And so he was just lying there, relaxing. And there was like a big birthday cake in the room. And at some point in time, I didn't know exactly who he was at the time. I didn't recognize him. I've seen pictures of Charlie Adler, but I, you know, I couldn't recognize him like. The voice actor, you know? Yeah. I mean, it's a voice actor. Exactly. You don't see them all the time. Anyways, so he's lying in the couch and he offered me a slice of cake because I was early to the session. I was like, yeah, you know, I tend not to like to eat before I do a session. And this character yelled a lot. Was a carnival barker. So I had to get real loud. And I was like, if I eat before I get real loud, sometimes I get burpee. Have you ever gotten that, Chris? Yeah. You ever done like really loud voices, but if you eat before it, you actually get like hiccups and shit. Oh dude, I was going to say, like you try to yell or something. If I scream, I get the worst hiccups. Yeah, you start getting hiccups. Yeah, and you can't stop it. And I normally only get that if I eat. Anyways, so I mentioned that. I'm like, yeah, you know, this character yells a lot. If I eat, I'll probably get the hiccups. I was like, I don't know if you do any kind of voice acting, but and just he didn't even know. He didn't even know. Didn't flinch. No, didn't move. And just very coolly. That's going on the cringe channel. Yeah, just very coolly said, yeah, I've done a few. I've done a few voice acting gigs. And I, and I tapped his foot and I said, I bet you have, but I was genuine. It was genuine. You fucking little. It was genuine.

I'm just like, oh, shit. But right, anyway, he didn't find me, I got away with Scott Free, until now. Until now, so, little chap who was- When you go back to Ireland, there's gonna be a team of yellow, squad, policemen waiting for you. To be fair, he ran around classrooms, smacking and biting people all the time. There was people who had like, bite marks on their palms and shit. Will you promise me that whatever project you do in the future, add the Blandman? Oh man, the Blandman is great. No, he's just like, oh yeah, yeah. He captures the important moments, he walks right up to the kid he shows in the video. He's like, for a scup, he's at every important moment. I love that guy. Un-faced. We had a Blandman too. Chris, how would he react to the September level that you guys would have tagged? He'd be like, Fuck. That would be it. Yeah, we had a Blandman too.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:12.109 --> 0:34:22.420]: 
  Yeah, we had a black man too. Dude, his catchphrase literally was, oh. That's what everyone just said. Because that's what he's done. That's what his response was.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:20.496 --> 0:34:54.803]: 
  Cause that's what he's, that's what was his response. Sorry, really quick. I did like how when you were talking about how in school, when you bullied people, it was because they were in a different social stratus. No, the thing is, I was pretty, no, no, no. But the thing about that is it's so weird because there's no written rules about what the actual layers of social stratus are in school. You have to figure it out. It's intriguing. But you know, but you know, right? Like you can feel it. When you walk by a group of people, you know exactly where they stand in the hierarchy of all those people. And you know how to treat them too. You know, like, isn't that weird? Do you think if you go back to a high school really, what do you think you'd sit on the hierarchy there?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:29.422 --> 0:34:30.958]: 
  No, no, no, no, no.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:36.578 --> 0:34:38.772]: 
  No, he's not.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:40.257 --> 0:34:41.134]: 
  No, right?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:48.373 --> 0:34:51.985]: 
  You know how to treat him too, and you know like isn't that weird?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:54.803 --> 0:35:05.417]: 
  Man, I cheese man. I don't know. I don't care about anybody from my high school Say if you went back, but I'd care so little about them that I'd be probably on the top in my head I'm sure some of them like it

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:58.853 --> 0:35:00.473]: 
  or save you identified. We're in hell.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:05.080 --> 0:35:07.105]: 
  For how long fuck that normal room fuck

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:06.801 --> 0:35:11.442]: 
  They'd still think of me back like as back then but like I just wouldn't care. I really wouldn't

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:11.442 --> 0:35:16.319]: 
  That's what you're talking about so much. I really wouldn't. I don't care what the other tolerant thinks of me.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:12.775 --> 0:35:19.812]: 
  Really what? I don't care what kind of horror in things of me. I need to change that name. That's the real name.

  It's that's what

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:40.455 --> 0:39:10.223]: 
  It's like a 3d printer, but no I had I had thought like I remember I had a weird idea I might use it a cartoon way in the future because I don't know if I can use it for but just the idea like a woman like it like a Fat pregnant mom like eating junk food and they going down like a junk food like big like becoming a new piece on the baby Right, that's kind of what it is in a really weird abstract way I wonder if you could program human DNA to reproduce a different animal you imagine it coding was yeah Like is creating a thing it doesn't create a

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:40.742 --> 0:38:40.995]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:42.396 --> 0:38:43.982]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:09.582 --> 0:39:12.518]: 
  They created a 1% cow human.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:11.944 --> 0:39:28.110]: 
  We all know they had to abort those in 2007. I think that's a board it will there's laws in the US where you can't let something Go out beyond like 30 or 90 days one percent. Yeah, it's stupid by the way I think we should have laws where you could create all the weird hybrids I want to see a fucking cow person screaming. I think you should be living a cow person if you like a cow person

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:14.239 --> 0:39:15.437]: 
  That to abort it?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:27.705 --> 0:39:31.772]: 
  Yeah, I know, but that's gonna lead to, you know, like fucking people that could fly and then you're like, what can I do?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:31.334 --> 0:39:46.673]: 
  I'm good at what a cow person. Here's an idea. If you made a flying person, they would take over and we would be right. Here's an idea. Arena with a celiac glass simps is no one top of it. Cow person versus flying person. The Geach gets spears. That would be cool. Hope you're fucking amazing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:32.549 --> 0:39:34.287]: 
  You're gonna be like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:34.287 --> 0:39:34.962]: 
  There's an idea.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:37.037 --> 0:39:39.045]: 
  Хорошоooo

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:45.171 --> 0:39:53.440]: 
  be cool but fucking amazing helpers is just a brick it's just a square of like they can't move it okay here's a good here's a good here's a good

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:49.862 --> 0:42:43.995]: 
  Okay, here's a good Here's a good hypothetical here's a good hypothetical if you created this cow person would you consider it life? No, I kill with a fucking machine. Okay. Okay. What if I had the mind of a cow but the kind of instincts Oh, well the mind of account wait the mind of account like my mind of a blank mind of account So what are the instincts of a human like you can walk upright? It can hold a spear stab stuff it can kill but also What if it would be stabbing the grass and eating the ground? Yeah, okay, but listen make whooping what if it had the instinct of a human to kill another human in defense right also What if you took away all sensation of pain? Then would you be okay with having would you be okay with having an arena of them murdering each other if Really right here's what you know how human are you can't if you can't torture something if you can't punish something like a robot Look at AI and AI breaks the law you can't put it in jail. It's gonna live forever. Anyways, there's a So if it can't be punished, it's not a human they shouldn't have human rights. Oh Chris. Did you see that? This is good wait wait no that's all was if you can't inflict punishment on it It shouldn't have the same rights as you okay just like just like a total Sociopath who doesn't necessarily follow the same no, but he would care about being locked up for because he can't get pleasure Also, if you had these and he's gonna die someday That's why it's it said if you heard these weird-ass hybrids that fought okay But they don't have any sensation of pain, but they can be killed that is punishment death is the punishment Yes, right. So we're death. Yeah. Yeah, they're aware of death. So But they only they're only aware of death once they see it once they've killed something else cuz they're they don't feel pain Like military experiment to create some mindless like military force make Asking you at this point would you pay $50 to go to a stadium to watch a bunch of cowmen Who wouldn't pay $50 to see that if I knew there was no pain I maybe But it's also your career You'd pay for it you watch it up on like lively gap Would you watch an arena of robots fucking stabbing each other yes, are they conscious yes robot wars, dude They're caught in fact one of them down there is holding his spirit before the fight starts He gets up on the shoulders of another and he goes what we are but robots I would Creepy old fuck program that in I would like some guy program that one line and nothing else is what I would assume Yeah, do you feel bad hurting a thing that's made out of code DNA is code exactly so you we should feel bad for robots a little bit Different when I say right I mean right in the amount of a cow man with the spear I mean okay, but when I think of a cow I think of a useless animal that's only purposes to put milk in my Well, it's good feels pay though

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:53.440 --> 0:39:53.912]:

Yes? Well, wait, I don't want to just watch somebody slaughter a bunch of cowmen It's cow cowmen versus birdman only if you make them in the hamburgers eat fucking burgers every day Yeah, these but these burgers from the dead cowmen go to starving children story to story More you know, I think a better question is would I go into the arena would you would you fight?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:15.735 --> 0:45:16.512]: 
  Stop

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:23.380 --> 0:45:31.379]: 
  What they all say no this time it's real this thing all say oh can you not talk about it is a purchase can't talk about I know I did your is I just you know I made a very

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:28.375 --> 0:46:48.902]: 
  I know what that is. You know what it is? I just, you know, I made a very specific effort this year to be not the guy who's like, I'm doing very cool things this year. You know, to be fair, that's a thing. I feel like the order we've got and the bigger the projects we work on, the less we can actually talk about. You know what I realized? I had a good conversation with our friend Hans about this, because he was, we were talking about stuff. And I said, I got to the point where I get sick when I go, I'm doing this and this and this and this and this this year. None of it ever happens because a couple things fall apart, you know, whatever happens. But there's also science on it where it says, if you say you're going to do something, it actually makes you less inclined to do it. If you say I'm going to the gym, instead of just doing it, you feel, and your friends patch you on the back, you feel. Oh, like you've already succeeded. You feel like you've already accomplished it. So I said, okay, this year, I'm not going to say I'm going to do this and this and this. I'm just going to either do stuff or not do stuff. That's a really good idea. I feel like there's the opposite though, too, which is that you tell everyone you're going to do something. So now you're kind of like. Applied. A little bit. But if you, if you break that a couple of times, the problem, that would work at the like friends who didn't do what we do. But you guys know what we all do. So we're like, oh yeah, that makes sense. Why you're not getting done ASAP because there's circumstances, but everyone has circumstances and animation takes a lot of time. And if you're, but my, I'll say, I'll summarize like this by saying, like, my biggest goal this year is to just do my own stuff, but also to just voice acting. A lot of stuff that's not on YouTube. I think YouTube is not a platform that I want to have to rely on for much longer.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:37.032 --> 0:45:38.382]: 
  It is.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:13.617 --> 0:46:14.730]: 
  I feel like there's the opposite.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:19.860 --> 0:46:20.451]: 
  Olá, parece-te estar!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:33.310 --> 0:46:35.841]: 
  animation takes a lot of time.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:48.345 --> 0:46:51.552]: 
  You've always been like, you've always said that. I've always said that. I still believe that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:49.662 --> 0:47:01.457]: 
  I've always said that and I still believe that. I can't say anything right now and I know it's such an old tired line, but really I promise you there is something that you will be seeing. It's related to television. Well, I'm sure everybody will be entertained.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:58.909 --> 0:46:59.466]: 
  Oh, okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:00.259 --> 0:47:06.942]: 
  Well, I'm sure everybody be entertained by all the vagueness. Yeah, you guys there's a thing out there

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:02.790 --> 0:47:16.746]: 
  Yeah, you guys there's a thing out there You'll see something when you see it enjoy what it goes on my schmucks the stuff that I Genuinely serious when I say that I'm most proud of the stuff that I've accomplished. It's not on YouTube

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:09.169 --> 0:47:10.047]: 
  those.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:16.071 --> 0:47:22.365]: 
  You've been on that other podcast too, you fucking... Which podcast? You fucking heehee. Yeah, you've been like, cooking us a little bit. We'll do that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:20.914 --> 0:49:34.463]: 
  Well, no, I've been trying to this year been trying to like collaborate a lot too. Yeah, but we're all aging We're all we're not cute little men, but that's what I meant like since being here in LA What was so interesting to me was between this podcast and the last time we've all been in the same room like doing this So much has changed I would make that clear like I really and I know it's such a tired lot of like just saying this to please anybody I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true But we've we've all made a lot of progress Yeah, I can't just say it really quick because there's gonna be a lot of eagle-eyed viewers out there They say did you don't you guys hate LA you guys talked about what you hated LA in like episode five? I still like LA, but it's undoubtedly the place to live if you want to have if you're doing what we're doing specifically voice acting Writing animation. I was wrong. I'll just say that right now. I was wrong I I whatever I thought of LA it was mainly because I didn't know people but now that you guys are all here Yeah, I was gonna say I think they could do the reason let me the reason we're all here is because almost all of our Friends are here. Yeah much the industries here and my friends are here and honestly those are the two reasons to fucking love this place And the weather is actually great to guys we turned the Hollywood hacks I don't know because when you guys know we did well when we were talking about LA before I thought we were talking about No, we were the city of LA. Yes, we were not the people right? You're right Yeah, and the typical Hollywood vibe which is really disgusting. Yeah, it's still there Yeah, we all we all experience is going to like a Hollywood party It just you know like a weird gross conversation with people petting themselves in the back Yeah, like those people still exist Oh, yeah But the thing that keeps you at least semi like in touch with regular fucking human beings It's just being surrounded by people that are your friends. Yeah specifically I do feel like Burbank is a more industry town and it has its own like bubbles and stuff But I do feel it's a lot of creative people those bubbles are if you're with the right people They're very far right and by the way, there's like a notion that that like the industry is totally fucked up That's not even true a lot of people that I met that I that I get along with That are in the industry as it's called or like good people it really depends on who you're around right and I think that's a selective That's that's almost like you selecting that just like my good friend. Give me a basket with a barf

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:25.994 --> 0:47:26.415]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:53.937 --> 0:51:04.035]: 
  Chris frozen a statue No, no, no, okay, so I did a year of pretty much Learning 3d learning more music stuff learning how to make stuff properly doing stuff that I know No one cares about but stuff that I enjoy learning like like music for that night I sunk a shit ton of time in the learning 3d this year, but it's rendering times that fuck me Right, I feel like I can make a really decent competent 3d cartoon now I know I had like texture like rig and all this other stuff and do simulations and pin cloth and all this fucking Annoying shit that sucks to set up right but I like the cool thing about 3d is you set up a puppet essentially and you're good And then you just you can do whatever you want and like if you move the arm forward You don't have to animate the cloth. It's a simulation so that will give you nice secondary motion or whatever right? It's very easy to do like shoot like you know shoot ahead or whatever the fuck you call that God how old am I? 27 I don't know what what do you call it when the thing over shoot over shoot? Yeah, sorry, it's cold either. I think it's kind of an offhand be over okay Well, it like it's really easy to do in 3d everything is super easy to do, but it's just rendering fucks you so anyway I learned and set up it's the setup and yeah render

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:55.995 --> 0:49:57.295]: 
  Oh hahahah

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:10.339 --> 0:50:10.677]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:03.917 --> 0:51:08.524]: 
  When Chris said two hours earlier, that's like two hours of frame by the way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. More than two hours for the overall frame.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:06.499 --> 0:51:45.312]: 
  Yeah, like if I wanted to render a full like let's I could I could do a minute of 3d animation now And it would probably take a week two weeks to render. You know, there's like whole like render farms. Yeah I've tried multiple and they're fucking expensive as hell right, but that's the thing I was gonna say So I spent that last year doing that a little bit of music and let's playing to build up a bit of money Right, and now I'm sinking a lot of that money into a little four-minute pilot hell Fucking yeah, and I've seen it is really good. I bet it is so that will be the next thing expect that damn That that was a promise. I've got it. I've got a little team working on it. No, no, I see

  Jesus.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:33.835 --> 0:56:46.547]: 
  But the spider, I remember the spider was like the Native American spider that makes me mean. No mouth. The most racist version of the interview. But it was a spider, so it can't be racist, so you get over it. My point is, what the fuck happened? Somebody, you guys leaked it? No, no, no, no, it got leaked on the deep web. Somebody hacked it. It was over. So it hacked my whole network, my entire fucking, the collective. The collective that was. Why is your password 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4? Them who had access to his channel. Oh shit. The network got hacked. The whole network, my entire YouTube network, everybody in all the YouTube thumbnails and titles were changed. So not thumbnails, the... Your network has access to your password? Yeah, that's Google for every network. No, no, no, no, no. They're managers on your account. Yeah, so on Google you can like. They have access to your account, not your password, but they're a manager of your account. They might as well have your basically password, but they can't do it, people will drive or anything, but yeah, they can fuck, they can see your analytics, they can edit your titles and thumbnails and everything. What happened? What I think was those guys hacked into their website or something. They did it to a couple of guys. They did it to like 2 or 3, it happened to each of them, like a week before it happened to mine, it happened to a bunch of them. Yeah, he announced that on there. Same guy. But yeah, it was hacked by a group that did a couple of them. I don't know if it was for security purposes or whatever their goal was. I uploaded the help and there's like pilot or a long episode, whatever you would call it, the 15th episode, I had it up, probably for like a year and a half, and it got publiced. Because it was just sitting there. And also, something else is that stupid Uber car too that I was working on, which was also something I had to basically pay to do. That was on there for a while, and two videos got publiced. And it was up for like a minute and a half or two. It was up for that long, but it was enough for people to download it. This is the real stinger. Someone downloaded it, re-uploaded it, edited. So they edited our version and they made it work. I saw that. They made it work. To me, you're gonna leak it, it's the strategy in effect. Fine, okay, you get up with it, it's already out there. But some guy, it was like 15 minutes. Everything sniveling autos edited it into an incomprehensible plot that made no sense. He took five minutes out, he took a third of it out. Yeah, yeah. It's just pointless parts too that made no sense to take out. There were like jokes. I had people commented on the 15 minute one, after they said the 10 minute one, because the 10 minute one went viral, did well. And people commented on the 15 minute one and said, oh, this makes sense now with all these parts in. And I was like, God damn it, people saw a fucking, how many people saw the shitty cut? That really is insulting. It's so stupid. He edited it down, why? Here's some content. Hey, guys, if you listen to Sleepycast and if you watch Hellbenders and you're a fan of these guys, you're a fucking idiot. You're fucking idiot. If he thought some parts went up for too long, it wasn't finished. We had like re-relations for that. We were rewriting it, we were redoing some of it. Luckily, we don't have to do it anymore.

We had we had I don't know maybe we'll eventually the future will do something I don't know what stuff we should but we literally had probably Chris I'd always talked about we probably could have made two seasons of good stuff with that But my point is was it a lot of work that there was another hell show no That was like 2012 or three long time ago, but yeah, we just clarified something I think we exaggerated that we didn't ever do that because we didn't want to change the name That was that was actually we didn't want to change the entire show because it was all revolving around hell by the end of it We yeah, it's We we were like

  What's the biggest thing she's been doing?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:16.255 --> 0:58:18.060]: 
  That was a long time ago, but yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:22.988 --> 0:58:23.730]: 
  That was that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:27.831 --> 0:58:28.995]: 
  We, yeah, it's...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:28.995 --> 0:58:31.392]: 
  We just live on over but we definitely we

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:32.539 --> 0:58:35.222]: 
  You guys are upsetting a lot of people right now. It's true.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:34.227 --> 1:00:24.606]: 
  I know we're breaking a lot of hearts. Hey, you know what? They're dropping some truths. Hey, but it's true. You guys, you know... If we ever have like free time, we could go back to it or something. Yeah, I look, I mean look, my ideal situation if I were the lottery, what I would do is I would pay all the money to just at least finish up the pilot and just release it. That's the finale basically. I think that's... But I mean, that sounds sad. It literally is a matter of money. Well, by the way, we got $20,000 to do that, which sounds like a lot of money. I didn't get any. Well, you didn't get any. That's my point. Exactly all of it. No, what happened was we got a couple thousand, so it was supposed to be the plan. I got paid, I'm going to contact the guy. I can't believe you got paid yet. No, it doesn't matter. But we had a budget of $20,000 for the animation, which sounds like a lot, but just for context, it's $10,000 a minute for average regular like, animation. That's what something like, you know, a regular... That's 15 minutes. It was 15 minutes long. They were like, hey, you're internet animators. And by the way, it's not as you can say it's awful for accepting that, you're right to say that. Absolutely. Yeah. But we should ask like... At the time, we were going through, you know, Yada who had cheaper rates back then, but as her company grew, sort of their rates, which is completely... To a regular level. To a normal level, yeah. They're actually still like, under in terms of like industry... Really? Rates. Oh, yeah. They're about there probably. It's close to par, but it's still less. It costs about 10,000 to 15,000 for... A minute. Yeah, one minute. That might not even include backgrounds or anything. It usually doesn't. It's usually if you give them keyframes to work with, for the most part, or at least a storyboard. They fill in the gaps. You learn the shit as you learn. But anyways, yeah, if you haven't seen the pilot, go watch it illegally. We don't care. It's already out there. Thepairofa.org. I'm proud of that. I would like... The only thing I'd like to do is we can clean it up a little bit. It would be cool to have it finished, but... That episode, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:35.880 --> 0:58:35.999]: 
  We

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:39.846 --> 0:58:40.757]:

  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:55.675 --> 0:58:56.097]: 
  It literally...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:57.885 --> 0:58:58.257]: 
  like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:03.994 --> 0:59:06.509]: 
  Yeah, I got it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:19.587 --> 0:59:20.937]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:20.937 --> 0:59:21.831]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:22.793 --> 0:59:23.940]: 
  15 minutes

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:23.940 --> 0:59:25.746]: 
  It was 15 minutes long.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:28.058 --> 0:59:30.319]: 
  And by the way, his plan is you can say it's our purpose.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:40.157 --> 0:59:44.849]: 
  to a regular level. That's who it is, Norm. Yeah. They deserve it because they're good. They're actually good.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:46.030 --> 0:59:47.937]: 
  in terms of like industry.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:47.937 --> 0:59:54.552]: 
  Really? Rates. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. They're about probably what they thought. It's close to par but still less.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:57.302 --> 1:00:01.808]: 
  One minute, yeah, one minute. That might not even include backgrounds or anything. It usually doesn't.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:06.685 --> 1:00:09.402]: 
  They fill in the gaps you learn this shit as you always yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:08.440 --> 1:00:08.997]: 
  it was.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:12.051 --> 1:00:14.802]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:25.467 --> 1:00:41.700]:
