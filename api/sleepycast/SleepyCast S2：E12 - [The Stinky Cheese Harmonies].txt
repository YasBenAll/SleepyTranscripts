Do you know statistically speaking people say season two is much better than season two. Who uses rulers when they measure? My way, no baby. Actually I've never measured my book. When you were in school What kind of freak had a projector and like one of those like astro projector things where you like mark it on the ground and then like record Like lines of it.

Yeah, that's what I meant What are you talking about? That's what I meant. When you go to bed you stand on a protractor and you step out of your body What kind of freak used one of those because everyone used those you know what I went to school right everybody had to use those You remember when I was in seventh grade or like when I went to school my mom would always like I would get a trapper keeper because it wasn't cool to do that No, yeah, I was in your

  those

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:48.902 --> 0:02:02.099]: 
  No, listen, your teacher's like, you need number two pencils, a protractor, a box to hold all your shit crayons for some reason, even though you're too old for crayons. I think I might have used that protractor. A little pouch to hold some fucking...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:55.500 --> 0:02:16.797]: 
  for some reason even though you're too old for crayons. I think I might have used that projector to hold some fucking things in. I think I used that projector like four or five times in my life. What the fuck are you talking about? You know those things, those like, are we talking about the semi-circle projector? Or the cultist thing? How did you get from astral projection to projector? Because he was calling it that. Shut up, Nile. It's like this little...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:05.051 --> 0:02:05.440]: 
  Yeah!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:05.440 --> 0:02:06.503]: 
  What are you talking about?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:08.663 --> 0:02:11.532]: 
  Oh, protractor, or the collector's gun.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:13.034 --> 0:02:20.442]: 
  Cause he was calling it that. Shut up, Nile. It's like this little upside down V-shaped thing. You hold the pencil on one side and the other thing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:13.050 --> 0:02:13.506]: 
  Cause he was called...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:20.442 --> 0:02:22.500]: 
  It's a rumbus so you can make a perfect circle.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:22.450 --> 0:02:27.732]: 
  No, wait, no, is a protractor like the thing here? No, that's a compass, right? That's a compass, sweet. So the same thing, I was,

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:25.994 --> 0:02:50.867]: 
  That's a compass. So the semi-circle is, what's that called? It's a projector, dude. Okay, so that's a projector. That's a projector. Okay, but what we're saying is... That is a compass, you're right. The teachers are like, don't buy those, but then you use maybe five times tops in your life. But when you're in math class, you need them. No, you don't! You don't! You need them five times! You're learning how to add them all to math! You did honors math! What are you doing? Think of the people who are stupid like me, Cory and Stanford. Yeah! You know what I remember from that? Wait, Niall did honors math? Yes, he's a faggot! Wow, and he didn't know that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:29.453 --> 0:02:32.288]: 
  It's a projector, dude. Okay, so that's a projector. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:31.444 --> 0:02:32.001]: 
  projector

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:33.402 --> 0:02:35.494]: 
  They tell you, the teachers are like, oh, by the...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:37.637 --> 0:02:39.527]: 
  But when you're in math class you need- No you don't!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:39.527 --> 0:02:44.944]: 
  Don't! You need the five times! You're running out of money how to add in more money! You did honors Matt! What are you doing?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:44.944 --> 0:02:45.569]: 
  You stupid, like me?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:47.644 --> 0:03:03.659]: 
  Wait, Niall did honors math? Yes, he's a faggot! Well, and he didn't know that? You didn't correct me earlier? I didn't know that I was a faggot? Because then he didn't do honors math? You know what, I don't remember. Did you do honors math? Did you do honors math? And the doctors like collecting beans, leave! No, you got to cast math. He got a 600 on his leaving hurt. That's a part-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:51.779 --> 0:02:58.849]: 
  I didn't know that I was a faggot Didn't do honors mats. You know what I don't remember you do honors math. Did you do our job?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:00.199 --> 0:03:14.391]: 
  Lee! No, you got a gas mask. He got a 600 on his leaving hurt. That's a four. No, I didn't. Oh, you got 500. 500 something. OK. 500. This is the camera what I got. Look, that's a really good leaving hurt. I got high results. OK, so I can final exam. This is for like the next, like, Saturday test.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:05.211 --> 0:03:08.687]: 
  5 minutes, look that's a really good livin'

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:08.687 --> 0:03:27.081]: 
  I got a high result call. So I can final this for like the next like, Saturday test. The compass is the thing with the V and the pencil, right? With the pin that you draw circles with. And then the protractor is the half crescent moon. Yeah, the crescent with the which is practical for fun.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:19.994 --> 0:03:21.478]: 
  all circles with.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:22.491 --> 0:03:38.505]: 
  Tractor is the half crescent. Yeah, the crescent this with the which is practical for finding the angle of it It's not you never get asked questions to do that. Maybe like four times in my life Well, you do because you have to figure out where to God I only use that like four times in my life. You know what I remember in my life

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:28.212 --> 0:03:29.950]: 
  It's not you never get a question

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:29.950 --> 0:03:31.941]: 
  No, do that maybe like four times.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:33.207 --> 0:03:34.506]: 
  I know I'm not a god I only

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:34.506 --> 0:03:34.894]: 
  Use that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:38.505 --> 0:03:44.361]: 
  After you hit 20, did you ever go to the store like, I need a fucking- I keep my protractor with the every bar. I need a fucking protractor.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:41.796 --> 0:04:09.319]: 
  I need a protector. I need a rhombus. I don't know what those things are called. Even artists don't use that when they need to draw circles. They just learn to draw circles. They do! They don't! Dude, to get perspective perfectly on paper, yeah, people do this though. No. To get the angle, yeah, you do. No, when you go to college for animation, they make you learn how to draw a perfect circle with your hand. That's one of the first things you do. Yeah, but that's not what it's for. It's for finding angles. I know, but what I'm saying is that kids don't ever fucking need to do that. But if you want to get perfect perspective.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:44.361 --> 0:03:44.445]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:47.702 --> 0:03:48.344]: 
  even artists

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:48.495 --> 0:03:51.499]: 
  use them when they need to draw circles. Just learn to draw circles. They do!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:50.993 --> 0:03:52.140]: 
  Don't! Don't!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:55.988 --> 0:03:58.199]: 
  No, they do not! No, when you got it!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:02.704 --> 0:04:03.126]: 
  Я бы даже...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:07.463 --> 0:04:17.504]: 
  If you're the only visual tool I've ever seen an artist use is one of those dumbass wooden dummies that you could like They don't even work good. I know bend their legs over look at it in just a

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:13.504 --> 0:04:16.744]: 
  They don't even work good. I know bend their legs all the way

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:17.504 --> 0:04:26.768]: 
  drawback where there's no help at all they're really got wrong proportions bad shitty anatomy okay cuz we're talking about protractors just like the fucking

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:21.064 --> 0:04:22.499]: 
  So look, we'll be just coming through since bad shit happened.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:22.499 --> 0:04:23.646]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:32.438 --> 0:04:33.957]: 
  Yeah, that's what I call one.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:52.500 --> 0:06:56.702]: 
  And Matt Groening said he was actually supposed to be white, but the animators fucked it up on that sort of one.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:56.702 --> 0:07:00.938]: 
  No, but I was gonna say, you know when you have a series and like, you know... You just got a series that...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:04.887 --> 0:07:35.970]: 
  I mean, no, no, no, no, Mr. Burns is black. Maybe there was like a black animator who's like, I want Smithers to be black! Yeah, like the first social justice warrior was like, there's no black. He's like, no, and you know what? Now I'm gonna make him gay, so fuck you. He's really black. He's kind of like a light coffee with light on it. He was black. I don't get into semantics here. I always thought Flanders was kind of like a blackish, like Bill Cosby's style. What's semantics? No, he's a... The semantics is like the nitty gritty of something. No, Ned Flatter's not a measure of what he's talking about. When you're talking about, let's say, let's go inside the box, figuratively speaking, and then you're like, well, what if the box doesn't have enough room for me? What if it's a small... Listen, nigga, I think...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:10.422 --> 0:07:10.928]: 
  Yeah, like the Fr...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:13.088 --> 0:07:13.425]: 
  like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:15.653 --> 0:07:20.327]: 
  It's like a light coffee with light on it. Don't get into semantics here.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:22.926 --> 0:07:22.943]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:22.943 --> 0:07:22.994]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:22.994 --> 0:07:24.394]: 
  Oh, he's a-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:25.845 --> 0:07:26.504]: 
  No, next.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:26.504 --> 0:07:29.355]: 
  When you're talking about, let's say

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:35.245 --> 0:07:37.675]: 
  Listen nigga, I think outside the box.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:37.219 --> 0:08:37.294]: 
  Yeah, he's never in the box. But what if it's a refrigerator box can completely fit inside of it? Dude, that's just some niggas. You're white, dude. You said nigga though. That's thinking as I thought. I remember once I was shocked. Me and Samper were going into the sleepy cabin office once and there were like two black dudes and Samper was like, hey nigga, and they were like, hey nigga. And I was like, it was like a weird thing in reality. We talked about this exact situation, yeah. We talked about it that day. I still think about it. The day that it happened we were having a podcast. Oh, we had a podcast that day? Oh yeah, that was 14. Oh, you know the episode? No. You're like fucking... I'm always quick to reach for number 14 in any situation. Why is your lucky number? It's bigger than 10, but it's more than 12. What do you think of the number 13? Is that unlucky? It's supposed to be. My dad's afraid of flying on Friday the 13th. He always makes sure not to book a Friday the 13th. You know what's fascinating to me though?

Okay, so what I wanted to talk about was trademarks and I guess we'll see other term There's like another one. There's copyrights and for me. I really don't like patents patents I don't like you're gonna someone patents, but like trademarks. I never understood the concept of a trademark I mean trademark like it's marching you trade it, but can you use it at any point? Can you? trademark

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:10.112 --> 0:13:12.441]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:13.690 --> 0:13:14.871]: 
  I'm not gonna talk about that. Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:21.216 --> 0:13:22.110]: 
  Got her.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:24.895 --> 0:13:27.561]: 
  Patents. I don't like it. You're gonna tell me what a patent is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:36.994 --> 0:13:40.420]: 
  mark the protractor or the compass. That's a patent.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:39.087 --> 0:13:47.997]: 
  I know, they're tools I've been used since the 15th century. Oh yeah, patents can be used for like machines or software. And now it's time for...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:42.546 --> 0:13:44.115]: 
  Oh yeah. So Patton is like a-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:46.512 --> 0:13:49.634]: 
  And now it's time for the definition hour with Chris.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:46.579 --> 0:13:49.364]: 
  And now it's time for June 1st and 9th, Christmas.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:52.789 --> 0:14:09.479]: 
  Define patent. It's a thing that shows that you came up with the idea You're the first person to kind of put your name on it Like I don't know a patents for like more so an idea but a copyright and trademarks are more so for like You know, I guess whatever

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:56.535 --> 0:13:57.970]: 
  I guess, or is that the right?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:59.708 --> 0:13:59.944]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:59.944 --> 0:14:01.007]: 
  You have to prove it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:01.007 --> 0:14:01.480]: 
  to me.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:07.302 --> 0:14:16.769]: 
  I guess what I'm thinking of... I guess what I'm thinking of... The copyright seems so loose though. There's also like that, like a creative copyright where you don't have to do anything legal or...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:10.626 --> 0:14:11.132]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:16.414 --> 0:14:30.724]: 
  Let's preface this by saying we don't know anything about anything. Yeah, we're not lawyers. No, I don't. We're not claiming to. As far as I know, as far as we know. There's like the creative copyright. But it's like it falls into a gray area because what's considered fair use when you're using trademarks?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:19.165 --> 0:14:21.494]: 
  Yeah, we're not lawyers. We're not in-house. I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:21.494 --> 0:14:25.324]: 
  I just know that as far as I know that you know as far as we know there's like the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:30.353 --> 0:14:42.385]: 
  Well, not like when you're writing something online. Like you just like you can't, for example, you can't, you have to put your hand up. You have like Facebook and you're writing like shit all day. It's like that's kind of falls under the creative copyright. Yeah. Something I don't.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:34.707 --> 0:14:36.141]: 
  You can't, you have to put your hand up. You're like fake.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:41.271 --> 0:15:45.953]: 
  Yeah, like I get it when someone wants to trademark their brand or their cartoon or something like that But there's all these software patents that limit games So now I worry baby. Oh, yeah sucks because you can come up with a game But then some other company will have a patent on like a gameplay element that you'll have to pay them to you Oh, yeah, that was like yeah, that was fucking Dragon Ball Z No, like let's say I think now has a patent on loading screen mini games. Yes. No. Yes exactly I think Bandai oh Bandai. Yeah because Dragon Ball Z had a little bandai like split I think so, but they had this thing where you could play mini games But it's like the patent I guess the patents up. Oh, it literally went up this year But it's like are you fucking serious? The reason why you're not allowed to like fuck around with shit during loading screens was because these guys had a patent on it Yeah, like I like patents but not the problem with trademarks is the rules like is the unfairness Like let's say you're you're they exist to be fair. Let's say you're playing no no

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:49.945 --> 0:14:51.953]: 
  I worry, babe. It sucks.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:58.399 --> 0:15:00.846]: 
  Oh, yeah, that was like, that was

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:02.297 --> 0:15:03.006]: 
  He had this thing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:12.524 --> 0:15:13.367]: 
  He said Nampo

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:14.177 --> 0:15:15.460]: 
  I think so.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:17.215 --> 0:15:18.852]: 
  games. Hand down, dude.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:17.940 --> 0:15:18.497]: 
  All right, dude.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:22.632 --> 0:15:27.441]: 
  But it's like, are you fucking serious? Meaghan's like a fucking techin' is loading? Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:27.492 --> 0:15:27.711]: 
  That's the one.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:31.525 --> 0:15:34.022]: 
  These guys had a pattern on it. That is horrible. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:34.613 --> 0:15:38.376]: 
  But not that's the problem with trademarks is the rules.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:39.068 --> 0:15:41.279]: 
  Like let's say you're you're they exist to be

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:42.443 --> 0:15]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:42.510 --> 0:15:48.383]: 
  No, no, no, no. The reason why they exist is to make money. Yeah, but let's say you're...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:47.235 --> 0:16:20.445]: 
  Yeah, but let's say you're playing like what crash bandicoot and then you like run out of the screen and starts loading right now It says loading in the corner and blinking loading for like what 20 seconds you're like on board You could have had a little mini thing to do there like smashing X to make fucking crash bandicoot Oh, you mean like anything like that devil may cry three. Yeah shoot the loading thing. Yeah exactly But they have a patent that's not allowed to do that anymore There's another patent on I think it was king of fighters had a patent on their training system for like teaching you how to play the game So that's the only game that's allowed to train you in that specific way. I think

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:01.714 --> 0:16:08.447]: 
  Oh, you mean like anything like that? In Devil May Cry 3, where they shoot the loading thing? Yeah, exactly. But they have a patent on that, so you're not allowed to do that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:08.447 --> 0:16:10.152]: 
  that anymore that's their pattern

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:10.152 --> 0:16:11.046]: 
  You're allowed to do it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:20.057 --> 0:16:24.816]: 
  I think you guys are all base base. That's that's very broad. It is very broad

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:24.529 --> 0:16:26.925]: 
  We're talking in a term like um so if you were

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:26.571 --> 0:16:33.709]: 
  You're acting like anybody can just like say oh well you can't do this It's like saying that you can't use the color blue and video games. No, that's my point. That's but it's true

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:31.718 --> 0:16:40.223]: 
  No, that's my point. That's, but it's true. Like, they will sue you if you do that, unless you pay them to do that. And that's not a lie. That shit is gay. That's not a lie at all.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:37.050 --> 0:16:45.404]: 
  And that's not a lie. That shit is gay. That's not a lie at all. What do you think of that? They changed the whole thing out. I think that was a lie. I know, but you're making it seem like they're not good on it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:41.455 --> 0:17:03.949]: 
  I know people who hold on to it. You're making it seem like they're not going to bother suing you. They will sue you over that. I know that. What about people who hold on to words and don't do anything with it? Like the guy who had edge. He didn't do anything with it. I'm pretty sure that your patents or copyrights will eventually expire. They will. They have to. What's the edge? You can't legally have an edge with a word that's like, it had like a nice meaning.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:47.361 --> 0:16:48.998]: 
  I know that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:48.441 --> 0:16:48.863]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:54.921 --> 0:16:55.495]: 
  Well, I appreciate it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:55.495 --> 0:16:55.630]: 
  That's right.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:57.824 --> 0:17:00.203]: 
  They will, they have to. Yeah, you can't legally have...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:03.392 --> 0:17:06.513]: 
  So somebody patented the word edge and you can use it anymore?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:05.299 --> 0:17:12.910]: 
  Yes, so it's like you couldn't say edge you couldn't use edge in your products if you're trying to sell something kind of edge You couldn't you know, okay again? I think you guys are very

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:11.407 --> 0:17:16.319]: 
  Okay, again, I think you guys are very off base here. Maybe. What am I doing wrong? I'm nothing!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:14.125 --> 0:17:49.883]: 
  Maybe what am I doing wrong? I'm completely by ignorance, but it's like can people really own words like that Oh, is that the question? Yeah, can you own edge? Where's it just like a sounds for a mouth? So many so they try to put a patent on let's play all the trademark the word But but they didn't do anything with it, which I think is completely acceptable isn't that what you're supposed to do You're fucking trade mark let's play some more god. I'm doing now. Yeah, that's the maybe they trademarked before some evil corporation Exactly that's a good like I don't mind it when people trademark something and then don't do anything wrong with it They're just trying to stop other people.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:06.942 --> 0:20:12.004]: 
  This is the most bullshit conversation ever to you guys living vertebrate fear. Don't you?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:07.650 --> 0:20:08.865]: 
  Both strategies?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:10.047 --> 0:20:16.577]: 
  Don't you what your fucking pee wee video got taken down over this shit

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:16.577 --> 0:20:28.677]: 
  all the things that I've done that one thing and you know what it's still up dude where on Facebook where hundreds of thousands of people are looking at that but what I'm saying it's not saying well it's not taking down a

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:25.015 --> 0:20:46.260]: 
  But what I'm saying is that you still have to slightly worry about that shit because there's assholes who will just take advantage of it. I'm not worried. If someone took Spasshead and quit Pussyflex. You're not wrong. I'm not saying that like, oh you gotta worry about every little thing, but what I'm saying is it's kind of bullshit that people aren't allowed to be creative and have their own little gameplay elements without checking a fucking giant book of Patton Spitz.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:36.051 --> 0:20:36.591]: 
  You're not wrong.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:46.260 --> 0:20:51.272]: 
  the same I agree but at the same time I think you're overthinking things it's not as bad as you think they are

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:51.272 --> 0:20:53.449]: 
  It is kind of what games it kind of is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:53.348 --> 0:20:59.153]: 
  So what's your option? Go home and cuddle up in a blanket and never do anything again? Well, I'm saying is like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:58.056 --> 0:21:21.749]: 
  Well, what I'm saying is, like, let's say you're a really talented, you know, program creator and you're like, I want to make a new animation software that will help animators, but then you gotta be all like, oh wait, Adobe has patents on the specific thing. That's another thing. When like, people own the market, like EA owns every single sports game ever made, now. That's why there's no actual, like, perfect, you know, software because they have to do work arounds without getting sued by other guys.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:08.670 --> 0:21:09.447]: 
  That's another thing.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:12.012 --> 0:21:12.434]: 
  every single day.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:14.442 --> 0:21:14.897]: 
  That's why there's...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:21.276 --> 0:21:25.832]: 
  Let me hit you so me and Mike we made swivel. Yeah, that's nonprofit

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:24.499 --> 0:21:27.908]: 
  That's non-profit. Huh? Non-profit. Oh, so you're thinking about it?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:27.908 --> 0:21:32.886]: 
  strictly profit

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:29.444 --> 0:22:26.447]: 
  I don't know you are wrong. They made it to keep the patent so that they could make money. They still could technically take it down even though it's non-profit because they own the patent but they probably won't because it's non-profit. Did you hear about the Disney change the whole legality of trademarks because Mickey Mouse was out of date? We talked about this last time. I'm not sure. I thought we did. We talked about how Disney owns Marvel but like Captain America is like more than 5 years old so in the old laws he would have been fair use by now and anyone in the world could have made their own Captain America cartoon. They did that with Mickey Mouse too. I think Disney has done wonders with Marvel and like Star Wars and everything. You're an intelligent person. Oh. I'm not saying that I'm not going to live life. I'm just saying it's bullshit. I'm a gamer. I don't want to work in 95 jobs. I am a gamer. I don't want my white picket fence to my 95 job. I don't want a 2.5. I saved Princess Peach. You can't deny that people don't get fucked on a daily basis because of this stupid Losh. Nile the file. Yeah I can. They can't because you got fucked. In what way?

  Can we talk about this last time? Yeah, I'm not sure. We talked about Mickey Mouse.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:57.034 --> 0:21:57.608]: 
  They did that with...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:58.215 --> 0:22:00.662]: 
  I think Disney has done wonders with Marvel.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:03.835 --> 0:22:04.982]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:50.805 --> 0:23:59.294]: 
  That's true. Except Mr Bean is more less fantastical. Mr Bean doesn't talk though, but he has like a charming like... I don't think Mr Bean can actually goop you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:56.498 --> 0:27:04.007]: 
  He's one of those classic movie of all time. Everyone's always like soon as I'm carrying this greatest film of all time

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:58.709 --> 0:26:59.232]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:00.818 --> 0:27:01.105]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:02.387 --> 0:27:07.939]: 
  It's the greatest film of all time. It's always, these movies are very ahead of their time. Boy.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:07.450 --> 0:27:11.027]: 
  Oh, well, yeah, and fairness was ahead of it. It was like one of the first movies

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:10.504 --> 0:27:21.979]: 
  You can't say it's a good movie or you can't say it's a bad movie. Yeah, because it was the you know format of all the movie. It's all standards. Like by today's standards you look at it and you say yeah, I get why it's a good movie. The way things are cut and edited is...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:13.559 --> 0:27:16.309]: 
  Yeah, because it was the, you know, format of all the movies. It's all stated.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:19.785 --> 0:27:45.351]: 
  The way things are cut and edited and the cinematography is all like that was like the first one to do all that shit. But, it seems like it's a cruise ship. Oh wait, a cruise ship, I'll give you a shit. I've never seen it, so I don't have an opinion. You'll watch it and you'll be like, oh yeah, I get it. It's very like point A to point B, like everything is just... There's like a category of movies where you can't really watch them because they've been parodyed so much. You've watched The Simpsons and Family Guy and everything, so it's just ruins, there's no point of even...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:26.181 --> 0:27:34.247]: 
  Oh wait, I'm gonna get crucified for that one. I'm gonna give a shit. I've never seen it, so I don't have an opinion. You'll watch it and you'll be like, oh yeah, I get it. It's very like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:29.995 --> 0:27:30.501]: 
  I don't have an opinion.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:42.330 --> 0:27:43.326]: 
  That's the problem with dying every day.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:45.064 --> 0:27:55.493]: 
  The one movie that stood apart from that was The Shining, though. Like, I thought that I would never be able to watch The Shining. That's a very good example. And then I watched The Shining, and I was like, wow, that is a truly fucking well done movie. Do you see that?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:48.338 --> 0:27:50.970]: 
  I would never be able to watch. That's a very good example.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:51.747 --> 0:27:52.776]: 
  I was like, wow, that is it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:54.885 --> 0:28:10.140]:

  I said a lot of things, you know, I say a lot of things.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:12.700 --> 0:43:50.247]: 
  There's something I remember seeing as a kid and I swear to God it's real I don't know how to explain it I just remember I was sitting behind the couch and I peeked my head up to watch what my parents were watching Yeah, I didn't say that and I was a white couch in a pink room And they were watching something on the show where they were these kids were in a graveyard You're parents have a white couch had a white couch in a pink room. It was Florida That doesn't be anything well like for it's like common in Florida That's not fucking important what's important was born to be because So there was teenagers that were in a graveyard and they were fucking with this one graveyard like they were smashing stuff on it And I was watching it and I remember

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:15.315 --> 0:43:16.092]: 
  I got it real.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:22.808 --> 0:43:23.449]: 
  Yeah, I did this.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:23.449 --> 0:43:24.074]: 
  See you for you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:31.448 --> 0:43:35.903]: 
  had a white cow in a pink room. It was Florida. It doesn't be anything.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:49.319 --> 0:43:51.664]: 
  I remember there especially like two stones there was

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:51.327 --> 0:44:42.205]: 
  There were smashing bottles on it and shit. Oh, okay. But what I remember vividly was there was this- it sounds fucking crazy, but there was this demon baby, like red-eyed demon baby, that flew up and fucking bit the guy's neck and like ripped him apart and was just blood and all the shit coming out. And I remember hiding from the couch and not knowing what I just saw. That was when they're always stuck with me. When I was like eight, I was at my friend's house. And then he said, my brother's watching a scary movie. So we stuck our heads around the door. And it was that scene from Evil Dead 2 where he's flying through the woods and he smacks into the tree. His face falls down into the mud for like- So scary? No, dude, right? He's face down in the mud for like 20 seconds and his face comes up and it's really scary. That fucking ruined my fucking- I was like ruined for like three years. I was way too young for that. I could understand that being scary with the- The noise of- There was no context. I didn't know it was a funny movie. I just saw that part.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:11.982 --> 0:44:12.505]: 
  What I was like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:23.642 --> 0:44:24.469]: 
  That's a little scary.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:40.956 --> 0:44:59.367]: 
  I think a lot of people have those like I had one too like I came downstairs and my parents were watching this movie Where two people were fucking and I was like peeking around the corner But it was like some cinemax thing like it didn't but to me it was like so important. Yeah I'm looking at something right now that I should be looking at

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:43.656 --> 0:44:44.044]: 
  Like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:43.707 --> 0:44:44.129]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:52.482 --> 0:44:53.342]: 
  It's a nice thing.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:59.367 --> 0:45:23.329]: 
  That was the same way with Six Feet Under. That's when I first, I told you this story. I don't think we ever released it publicly, so I could probably say it. First time I ever saw like actual gay porn. I was one of the dudes at Six Feet Under were like fucking chargers. Yeah, when he was like hard fucking him. In a fucking like parking lot under like a like underground parking lot thing. Hard fucking him. You don't understand, it was intense. And I was just like a kid, I was just like, I didn't know what I was looking at.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:08.108 --> 0:45:10.437]: 
  I was with the dudes six feet under where he was fucking

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:10.437 --> 0:45:10.926]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:20.714 --> 0:45:21.304]: 
  I was just like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:22.013 --> 0:45:25.540]: 
  I didn't know what I was looking at. Bear back like no aloofness means something.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:23.937 --> 0:45:34.990]: 
  No, it was like the car was fucking shaking on the front of it and he was cursing It was kind of slapping and I remember cops come and they run away, but I remember my hair

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:29.961 --> 0:45:31.007]: 
  Crazy.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:31.007 --> 0:45:31.868]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:33.977 --> 0:45:43.950]: 
  They had very serious intentions with that show, I think. You know, six feet under, maybe it should have been called six inches in, you know what I'm talking about?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:39.495 --> 0:45:40.947]: 
  He's not debt sh誰

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:43.495 --> 0:46:17.565]: 
  I just remember one scene he was just talking to this guy at a party and then he's like he's like you want to do this and the guy's like Yeah, and then immediately there's fucking and I'm just like it was not expecting Was that the dude from Dexter? Was he the gay guy in that show? Probably he might have been Do you think there's a word for what you just said, Stampery? What? Where it's not nostalgia because you don't get that nice warm feeling but when you're a kid and you see something that may not mean something to anyone else except you But it's so important to you that it like it's always sticks with you forever Scare Stalger I don't even mean anything specifically scary I just mean like something that affected you so much, but it may not have affected anyone else What's the same thing?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:43.950 --> 0:45:44.710]: 
  Remember, once

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:47.494 --> 0:45:47.950]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:54.374 --> 0:53:08.320]: 
  had to like rotate things. Yeah it was on the same Winters 98. Winters 98 is where I got it. Ghost in a Shell. Ghost in a Shell, Abe's Odyssey. Yeah, Abe's Odyssey. There was another one where you were kind of, it was like Duke Nukem-ish, but you were like a little mini Duke Nukem, and you come in on like a flag thing, and it was like a little platformer, and you collect CDs and gems, and it was almost like Mario. And that's what I loved about it, because I was playing Mario, and it had like the star system, but with rubies, so you collect enough rubies, you can go to the next area. And that also dealt with like platforming, with like gravity flipping and stuff. There's just something fascinating about old DOS games. Do you guys remember the Windows 98 screensavers? It was like a maze with a prize and cheese. Yes, dude! I used to watch that for hours. Like pipes! Pipes is awesome too! Pipes is the fucking shit! I used to use that, and then I would like pretend that I was platforming on it for some reason, like I would like follow the path, and- but in the maze one, I tried downloading it on one of my dad's computers, because he had like the shitty computer, and I ended up downloading the virus, because you couldn't actually download the fucking screensaver. Yeah, the screensavers always came with viruses. But they came- it already came with it, so I was downloading it, and it was already installed. Yeah. There was this dumb girl in my stake. I don't know if she's dumb now, I'm sure she's fine now, but like- Are you sure? And when she was a kid, she was dumb, like a lot of us were. But I convinced her that like, um, the screensaver, the space screensa- she was actually in space, and she was like- WOOOOOO!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:55.605 --> 0:51:55.994]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:00.287 --> 0:53:00.389]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:09.737 --> 0:54:40.137]: 
  And I was like, yeah, we got it! Ahhhhh! And then I take it down and look. I remember that one too. We're back home, dude. And she was like, ugh. And there was the Marquis, you remember that? You could talk to him when you wanted. Oh, the Marquis, yeah. Like, fuck you, dad. Do you ever play the game Brave Fencer, Musashi? No. Oh my god, it was the best fucking PlayStation game. First of all, it was funny as fuck. And it was really fun. Because it wasn't a game where it was like turn-based, it was a game where it was like almost Mega Man-esque, like you could take, it was Kirby-ish, like you could take moves and you could use their move against them. Like, I just remember there's this one part though where I went to town and I ended up like playing this hotel game. But what's funny is there's all these like connotations, like there's like this librarian at the beginning that me and my friend would joke about and it's like he always seemed like he wanted, because he's like, oh you're such a swift learner, Musashi, you should have come back with me to my quarters. He always seemed like he wanted to fuck me. So I'd always go back to him. Coming back to my quarters is the, that means you want me to take. But it's funny because everybody's like that. Like you go in town and then you like talk to this like hooker lady at the front and she's like, oh you're a little young for me but I think I could go around with you. Like this is semi related but a trailer came out, I think it was yesterday where the first Oculus Rift sex game came out where there's these girls like tied up in a dungeon. I thought fucking Oculus first. Wait, hold on. I thought these assholes were like- The second that shit came out people were making sex. No, no, but I mean an actual game. I object. Like a Dark Souls S game. I thought these assholes were like no sex games for an Oculus Rift. It's not like they can stop it. They're just making them monitor. But the girls are gross. Yeah. The girls are gross. They look like PSU girls. They said they were like, we're gonna, no. But it's like that's what people are gonna buy it for anyone. Really a monitor with a gyroscope. They have no like saying why. Yeah, I know.

I get bad motion sickness from any kind of peripheral like that. I cannot use. The new one is supposed to prevent that. It's so high megahertz.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:32.584 --> 0:55:35.504]: 
  You're essentially in a world. I refuse. I refuse.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:39.638 --> 0:56:05.389]: 
  I spent like 700,000 on a video card dude, I just did it. But why would I ever buy something that made me sick before? No, no, because this has the refreshments on it. Well you shouldn't buy it because it makes you sick. The new one actually doesn't make me sick. Yeah, but my cognitive bias tells me that I'm not never going to buy one. Well that's fine. That's the thing. Cory doesn't need to buy one. He's happy on his monitor. That's great. I would personally love to step into a world and walk across the big fucking river. It's gay, but I'd love to climb a mountain in the sky right now. It sounds like a horrible thing.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:39.942 --> 0:55:39.992]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:46.675 --> 0:55:46.945]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:47.502 --> 0:55:55.450]: 
  You should buy it cause it makes you sick. The new one actually does not make me sick. Yeah, but my cognitive bias tells me that I'm not never going to buy one. Well, that's fine. That's sick.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:56.665 --> 0:55:57.998]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:57.998 --> 0:55:58.707]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:05.389 --> 0:56:07.380]: 
  Wait, it's fed your afternoon.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:06.621 --> 0:56:13.489]: 
  Yeah, just fucking toiling through a river. Piranhas everywhere. The Oculus will never go the way of the Ouya, but because of Per...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:10.536 --> 0:56:10.722]: 
 ...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:13.270 --> 0:56:17.944]: 
  I personally love to be Jesus for the afternoon and just walk across the water and

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:17.826 --> 0:58:10.635]: 
  Everyone praising that. 90% of all the people who use Oculus are saying- I'm just saying right, I was at John's house and he had the Oculus right, and he put on this demo where you're literally just standing outside of a house. And it was blowing me away. All you're doing is standing outside of a house, and I was like, WHOA! It was fucking crazy! John was so like, lovely because like when we were on the roller coaster and he'd want us to experience it to the max, so he'd get the chair and he'd be moving it to the next thing. He'd be doing it wrong, completely wrong. I know. I almost hit my fucking head on the monitor because he like flew me forward, remember that? Yeah, but he was trying, he was trying. But the thing is, this is what I don't understand. He wasn't trying, he was caring. This is what I don't understand. Roller coaster rides, like that roller coaster ride did not make me sick. Flying around the fucking room didn't make me sick with the Oculus. All right, Cory, fucking relax dude! Yeah! When I had to walk with the Oculus, like I had to manually move my controller and everything was completely straight, then I was fucking sick. Yeah, that makes sense though, that makes sense. But they fixed the refresh rate, so therefore... I could only play Oculus if I was fucking parasol. I'm only gonna buy one if you can't see the pixels, it's the only way I'll buy one. I don't think you can, I think they've... Well if you can't see the pixels, then I'm gonna buy one. Don't quote me on that. As far as I'm concerned, the only reason anyone would buy an Oculus is so that you can add like macro girls sit on you. That's it. But like, also they're creating like this weird like celebrity simulator. We watch through a crowd and all these girls are showing you the tits and you're like, I'm sure people will just live in that world. Exactly! That's all it's gonna be used as, these little quirky games where people, the girls just gonna be like, like that, you're just gonna have your titties. That's the mini game. You're like, you know, have your banana thing, you're fucking and you're just gonna fuck it. I'm gay, like I put myself on my... I put myself on my... I put my honeymoon with my wife, she's like... She's like, she's like, I don't know, it's like... I get married to a real girl and we both go on her honeymoon on the Oculus. That's all the Oculus is gonna be. In a few years you're gonna get like, oh, that's a nice tree, that's a nice... I like riding on this boat. And then you're gonna be like, alright, now where's the naked girls? Let's do a harmony. You start. You start.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:19.665 --> 0:56:20.442]:
