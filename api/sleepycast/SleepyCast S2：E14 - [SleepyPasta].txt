It was thriller. But it was literally the spaghetti perfect exactly. I was just like, my volume was all the way up, and I was like, I was fucking still. I didn't believe it. I'm expected. Wait, wait, before you talk. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Something like that happens to me every now and again, where I leave my computer on, and then it will just go like, I'll be sitting in silence for hours, and it'll just be like, are you tired of your dog? What the fuck? It's just U-Torn. U-Torn just plays ads at random. I'm so happy you have U-Torn open. All the time. It's just open, but I don't see. But anyways, you just leave it open, and it plays those ads at random. And I didn't discover where it was. I had a fucking week-long search for what was making that fucking noise once, and I found out it was U-Torn. Got really fucking mad. Sometimes if you watch a porn video, you get like, pappa-beds. Sometimes you'll forget where it was open. It'll be two hours. It'll be like, oh, shit.

Oh, yeah Yeah, and there's nothing there's no noise There's just like a really like there's like a droning guitar part that plays for the last five seconds And then stops yeah, and then at the very end it's just silence for like 16 minutes Like a record thing cuts on and then there's like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:36.465 --> 0:10:37.461]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:28.812 --> 0:11:34.954]: 
  It was like, that's like me almost. Yeah, I like that. Cause we should have played a song you forget it's on and it just happened. Yeah, I used to go to bed with it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:30.752 --> 0:11:43.493]: 
  Yeah, like I should have played a song you forget it's all I did happen. I used to go to bed with it like blasting out like 15% Audio with my headphones in right yeah, and I'd fall asleep to that and I'm gonna wake your ass up

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:37.064 --> 0:11:38.447]:

  And then they wake your ass up.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:43.493 --> 0:12:06.662]: 
  I was like, I couldn't find anything better for months, but right after it happened it turns out that he coded it in the game So there's like a point zero zero zero one percent chance of it playing or whatever And it's just it was like the fucking loudest music I've ever heard. I honestly just thought I was getting invaded by like like not your something

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:58.039 --> 0:11:58.950]: 
  I'm just hanging around.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:05.751 --> 0:12:12.450]: 
  Yeah, we'll be scared to shit. Just to make sure. Yeah. When you were 17, the most scared you ever had. I swear it. I swear it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:10.645 --> 0:12:20.112]: 
  I swear it, I swear it. Most I had been scared before that was when our house got burgled and we came home during it. That was pretty scary. When Minecraft beats it by lands.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:13.412 --> 0:12:13.935]: 
 モブサイト

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:14.003 --> 0:12:15.134]: 
  I didn't scare before that was when I was...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:18.053 --> 0:12:18.947]: 
  Oh, Minecraft beats.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:21.057 --> 0:12:35.097]: 
  Because at least the advantage of playing my video is that it's not broken. That would be a skill. Yeah, that would be a lot of skill. But it's like getting a jump scare in a video. It just comes out of nowhere and you're like, you can't help being scared. But it was the fact that came out of nowhere and it kept going. And it's like, what am I doing wrong? What am I doing wrong? What is this?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:22.980 --> 0:12:25.124]: 
  That would have been skill.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:12:25.124 --> 0:12:25.647]: 
  No, but it's like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:33.561 --> 0:12:48.006]: 
  What am I doing wrong? What is this?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:44.597 --> 0:12:51.449]: 
  frozen a few of the taking back Everyone that hero bride story came out I was like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:48.006 --> 0:12:49.002]: 
  Everyone that hero

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:51.449 --> 0:12:54.621]: 
  It's really scary. It was a shitty Zelda one.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:52.495 --> 0:13:00.325]: 
  What was that? What was that? Was that a shitty Zelda one? Or a leaky-ass face for like, Majora's Madness? Oh, fucking bad crowd. That's a really good one. That one was a good one, dude. That one was a good one.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:56.680 --> 0:13:06.889]: 
  Oh fucking that's a good one that one was great creepy because at the time like the idea of it is so interesting But the fact that there's actual footage yeah, I thought that was great. What's this?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:05.286 --> 0:13:31.864]: 
  Yeah, I thought that was great. What's the story behind it? I always saw images where it's like people sleep. This kid was at a garage sale or something. He bought an old copy of Majora's Mask, but it turns out the kid who owned it drowned. So he possessed the Majora's Mask. And then the kid started playing it and the game started, like he hacked the game to make it look like the game was fucking with him. But he did it in really clever ways where it suited the story of the kid drowning. But it's really creepy if you watch the video. He modded it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:07.311 --> 0:13:09.505]: 
  I always saw the images where it's like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:07.497 --> 0:13:08.948]: 
  I always saw the images where it's like...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:09.505 --> 0:13:10.011]: 
  This kid was a...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:17.993 --> 0:13:19.394]: 
  mask and then the kids started

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:24.355 --> 0:13:25.469]: 
  But he did it in...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:28.152 --> 0:13:28.540]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:30.784 --> 0:13:37.332]: 
  He modded it and he made it like mod to play like specifically how he described the story word for word in the text. It's really bizarre

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:36.640 --> 0:13:43.525]: 
  I mean, if you explain it like that, it sounds pretty gay, but it's just the storytelling of it, it's pretty well done to take a game in the medium like that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:41.010 --> 0:13:46.950]: 
  to take a game and then leave it on. I mean, it's all that's gonna tell you. What he did with creepypuss is like, I was playing with a Mario game. Yes, no!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:46.377 --> 0:13:51.017]: 
  I saw Barlow's eyes with black. Turn the gaol off you fucking retard!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:50.005 --> 0:14:06.795]: 
  I fucking love dead Bart. It's like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:55.860 --> 0:13:57.852]: 
  I was asking for help, but I...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:57.852 --> 0:13:58.493]: 
  그리줘

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:58.493 --> 0:14:01.007]: 
  I just saw a word for you, please.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:04.146 --> 0:14:05.310]: 
  realistic

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:06.795 --> 0:14:09.006]: 
  Matt, like this story is like, I work for Matt.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:09.006 --> 0:14:14.220]: 
  That grining really hated it. Yeah, he did not want to talk about it. So when I saw the footage...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:14.220 --> 0:14:24.362]: 
  Bart fell out of an airplane and when his family were at the funeral, they were all staring at a hyper realistic corpse of Bart Simpson. It's like, why would his family be looking at that? Why won't they bury him shit? But then it's like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:20.498 --> 0:14:21.443]: 
  Why would his family be looking at him?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:21.443 --> 0:14:29.492]: 
  Looking at that, what were they burying and shit? But then there's like other like prefixes where like, Squidward's eyes were gouged down his head. This picture of Squidward's eyes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:26.995 --> 0:14:28.142]: 
  It helps me wear my New Year'saprès, the limelight is down, the contour is in, vlog on the vlog just almost.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:29.492 --> 0:14:35.500]: 
  It's just like they take one of those like you know run a steppy painting photos of squid They just like paint his eyes black

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:35.500 --> 0:14:57.960]: 
  Stupid as shit I will say the dot exes are fucking hilarious but the last episodes take the cake like the autistic ones or the autistic fanbase like the sonic ones, like you guys like when they're trying to defend like TV shows like old Saturday morning sonic cartoons it's like the last episode of that it always ends the same way with like hyper realistic blood and being haunted until I die or something

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:44.865 --> 0:14:48.443]: 
  Like the sonic ones like guys like he's like one of the training defense

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:51.345 --> 0:14:51.936]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:51.936 --> 0:14:52.206]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:57.066 --> 0:15:01.909]: 
  I remember the tail's always like There was like a hundred videos of them!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:59.159 --> 0:15:07.950]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:06.010 --> 0:15:09.368]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:07.950 --> 0:15:32.436]: 
  This kid I knew when I was younger, he showed me a book called Suicide Mouse. Do you know about that one? Yeah, I know. It was like, well, there was this first cartoon with two men, Ricky Mouse walking down the side of the house. And the beast came and swisted, and he began screaming. And this kid was actually petrified. He couldn't sleep that night when he showed it to me. He was like, I just saw the most fucked up thing. And I was laughing at it. There's a video like Mickey Mouse walking that's super sick. So the guy going, ah!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:12.591 --> 0:15:14.599]: 
  Yeah, I know what happened. It was like, boy, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:26.007 --> 0:15:27.644]: 
  Сопр Fahrenheit

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:32.436 --> 0:15:56.179]: 
  He keeps cutting to images of the content. Yeah, it's the gay shit everyone's laughing at. There's corpses in fucking tubs and like walls. There's just fucking walking down the street. Distorted buildings. People are fucking retarded. When I hear the fact, when I hear like a creepypasta of fucking Star Fox where he's flying over a water, I'm like, that's autistic and doesn't scare me at all.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:33.617 --> 0:15:36.554]: 
  Yeah, it's the gay shit ever also happens recently.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:15:44.485 --> 0:15:44.704]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:51.066 --> 0:15:52.450]: 
  I know but I watered it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:52.450 --> 0:16]: 
  I'm like, that's autistic, it doesn't scare me at all. I like creepypastas that make it seem somewhat realistic. Yes. Where a guy's like, I bought a carrot and it seemed like it was hacked, but it was just like the way he told it was really fucked up, like that Pokemon Black.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:58.457 --> 0:15:59.588]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16 --> 0:16:11.451]: 
  Pokemon Black one is really cool. Yeah, that would be awesome. Like an actual game of that would be awesome. If that actually happened, that would be awesome.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:06.996 --> 0:16:17.442]: 
  Yeah, that was sweet. If that actually happened, that would be terrifying. Like if you found that character. But the words was like, and then I turned off the game and it turns up back on and Mario is real.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:16:11.451 --> 0:16:13.088]: 
  terrifying like if you found that card

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:16.109 --> 0:16:18.809]: 
  And Mario is real! Shut up!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:17.442 --> 0:16:30.503]: 
  Shut up. In that Cycord, he turned his thing off, but then the computer popped on and all these new pictures popped up of the girl, the Acorn thing with red in her eyes. And it's like, why would this, how cares? If my computer were doing it, I'd sell tails with eyes of a guy.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:26.234 --> 0:16:27.449]: 
  in her eyes and it's like why would

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:28.039 --> 0:16:34.452]: 
  If my computer don't I saw tails with ice Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:30.503 --> 0:16:32.190]: 
  Do I flap? I thought you'd flap. Yeah!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:32.190 --> 0:16:32.882]: 
  I love going there.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:34.452 --> 0:16:36.949]: 
  When Mario looked at me, he opened his mouth.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:36.949 --> 0:16:37.995]: 
  only static in

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:40.493 --> 0:16:43.851]: 
  It's like, yeah, it's big crush. It's like an old game.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:44.779 --> 0:16:54.449]: 
  talk proper? First of all, if Mario was getting like eaten or like ripped apart by Bowser, I would be laughing my fucking ass off. I would be like, oh no, fucking help me!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:50.534 --> 0:16:51.951]: 
  Are we going to continue? No!

 SPEAKER_04 [0:16:51.951 --> 0:16:52.457]: 
  I'm so curious, but...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:54.449 --> 0:17:01.283]: 
  Listen to insonic exe the last thing like his face came up really realistic. Yeah, he's like I am God.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:58.954 --> 0:17:06.008]: 
  Yeah, I am God. So it's like the least scariest thing ever.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:04.624 --> 0:17:38.020]: 
  We should make a creepypasta right now. We should. Let's pick the game. Let's find something that's not remote. Okay, what's the game? Donkey Kong. We can all relate to that. Donkey Kong 64. Donkey Kong 64. I've never played 64. Okay, no way. Donkey Kong. I was at a garage sale from this man. He said his little boy died mysteriously. And he said his most favorite game was Donkey Kong 64. And he would always sing the DK rap. And that was his last words before he died. And I bought it off of him. That's a shitty creepypasta. No, it's like a sequel. It's a piece of corn. What happened then?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:07.662 --> 0:17:15.946]: 
  We should. Okay, let's pick the game. Let's find something that's not remote. Okay, what's the game? Okay, Donkey Kong. We can all relate to that. Donkey Kong 64. Donkey Kong 64.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:17:34.442 --> 0:17:36.299]: 
  No, it's like a circle.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:37.598 --> 0:17:41.952]: 
  He's giving away too much of the scare so far.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:40.500 --> 0:17:43.943]: 
  I was like, it was a nice bright sunny day. And I just got...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:41.682 --> 0:17:56.920]: 
  It was a nice bright sunny day and I just got my weekly allowance and I really wanted to buy a game. I'll do it. Isn't that normally kind of... I've never heard one by the way. Don't give away huge or giant. Okay, okay. She can't explain in depth. The general formula. I'll be vague, I'll be vague. My father fucked me in the end.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:17:44.939 --> 0:17:44.955]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:46.339 --> 0:17:47.993]:

  This is a 원�leye độ

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:49.005 --> 0:17:55.097]: 
  I've never heard one by the way. Don't give away you so you can't explain in depth. I'll be there.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:57.899 --> 0:18:08.985]: 
  But it was a bright sunny day so I didn't care that much. Okay wait. I was at a garage show with my mom and I bought a copy of Bunking Hog 64. Wow! I said. I cannot wait to play this one.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:06.218 --> 0:18:06.944]: 
  Wow!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:06.944 --> 0:18:07.298]: 
  said.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:08.985 --> 0:18:34.787]: 
  Okay, my mom handed me the cartridge. I noticed that it was missing something and no longer had a label, but it did have something written on it called Donkey Kong 64, the Untold Copy. Or, Unsold Copy. He had a told copy? I told him! Oh my god! But who is a cyborg? That's not good details, you gotta go more. Those are the details that put in. Okay, so it was like, behind it, I turned the cartridge over and to my surprise, the real Shigeru Miyamoto signed it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:18.655 --> 0:18:19.347]: 
  I'm so...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:19.802 --> 0:18:23.447]: 
  He asked, courting. I knew it. I'm told. Dude, I'm told.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:23.447 --> 0:18:28.949]: 
  But who is inside? That's good details, you gotta go for those are the details that put in okay, okay, so it's like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:28.949 --> 0:18:29.725]: 
  behind

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:34.365 --> 0:18:39.951]: 
  Okay, Mick. I was so excited to have that signature. I got on my two-wheeler and I got on my two-wheeler.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:39.951 --> 0:18:47.005]: 
  and rode it really fast back home. I didn't even bother to drive into the garage. I just jumped right off my bike and threw my bike in.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:47.005 --> 0:18]: 
  into the lawn like they do like in those shows. I ran into the house and I popped that sucker into that

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18 --> 0:18:55.004]: 
  and then Nintendo 64, put on the play button.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:55.004 --> 0:19:17.363]: 
  and got ready for a special treat. This was when I first noticed something was wrong. When I put in the cartridge, I felt it lock in. And I never noticed other games do that before. I tried taking it out, but it wouldn't come out at first. So I just figured maybe there was a little piece of plastic sticking out, but I just let it slide. So I turned on the game, and there it is, the old logo I used to remember a year ago when I was two. One.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:17.110 --> 0:19:24.501]: 
  I'm going. This dude fucking threw himself. It's a little four years old. It's like two or three. It's a little baby.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:21.582 --> 0:19:22.189]: 
  for you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:24.501 --> 0:19:34.002]: 
  Okay, we're standing, Shad, here we go. Now the whole bike thing is- Those are the kind of details. You fucking put someone on a bike and push the bike down the hill. You're gonna put in stupid ass details like that to make it more realistic. The DK rap starts-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:25.497 --> 0:19:27.134]: 
  Shad, here you go. Now the whole bike thing's gone.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:27.134 --> 0:19:28.821]: 
  Those are my kind of details.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:29.496 --> 0:19:30.424]: 
  I'm ill.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:34.002 --> 0:19:37.495]: 
  playing something was off about it the lyrics

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:37.495 --> 0:19:43.941]: 
  were all jumbled and their eyes were glitching up but I just shrugged it off and pressed

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:43.941 --> 0:19:47.721]: 
  It's dark, ready to relive some of my childhood memories.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:49.307 --> 0:20:12.443]: 
  Zach? Zach's dad? I don't fuck. I looked past the DK rep. I said, time to play my favorite game. I started a new file up. And usually when you, when Donkey Kong sees some banana, he says, oh, banana. But he did not this time. He said, oh, banana. But it sounded like a little boy screaming. I couldn't quite make it out all the way. That's when I turned around.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:12.561 --> 0:20:14.333]: 
  Sorry, I went red, please, please.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:17.370 --> 0:20:43.949]: 
  Not even my mother off, she was me as usual. I started it up. Just like I remember it, the pan in with the bird and everything, you guys know the rest. Cranky Kong told me I had to go get the three barrels, so I could learn the basics. Timing, breaking barrels, and jumping. But something strange happened. After Cranky told me my mission, the barrels were nowhere to be found. I looked everywhere but I couldn't find the barrels. Confused, I entered the banana horde, hoping to find something to do. That was just a real tutorial, Horde.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:20:25.352 --> 0:20:27.462]: 
  Peggy Kong told me I had to go get the three barrels.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:42.666 --> 0:20:50.159]: 
  That was just a real tutorial for you. That was just a real fucking... That's perfect! That's what they do! It's real life! You gotta pace it so it's not all scared.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:48.505 --> 0:20:51.998]: 
  So it's not all scared after entering the banana ward. I noticed the screen

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:51.998 --> 0:21:02.950]: 
  was a lot darker than usual. I tried to adjust the TV brightness, but for some reason it stayed as dark as it was. Then I got the idea that I would get on Skype and contact my friends.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:56.993 --> 0:20:57.449]: 
  It's

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:02.950 --> 0:21:07.995]: 
  and ask them if they knew anything about this banana sound that Donkey Kong made.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:07.995 --> 0:21:14.492]: 
  As well as the glitchy eyes, the jumbled lyrics of the rap, my mom in red faced behind me.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:14.003 --> 0:21:31.907]: 
  and the missing barrels that Cranky spoke of. As I stood there on Skype, after pressing Enter, I waited. Ten seconds later, I saw my friend was beginning to type as the three little dots began to bounce.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:23.909 --> 0:21:26.929]: 
  After pressing enter, I waited.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:31.907 --> 0:22:13.994]: 
  But then they stopped whatever he was going to write he never sent me so I went back to the game But now oh me okay now I realized something was very wrong the screen had gotten darker even more so than before But this is when things really started to shake me up. I looked into the corner of the screen I noticed something was happening So I made Donkey Kong walk over there to my utter and complete shock a 3d model of King K. Rool started rising out of the But he had no textures. He was purple He faced my character and had no animations. He was just he posing He slowly moved towards Donkey Kong and I made Donkey Kong run the other direction as fast as I could It's roughly genius

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:36.143 --> 0:21:36.953]: 
  So I went back to

 SPEAKER_04 [0:21:38.995 --> 0:21:39.737]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:13.994 --> 0:22:21.300]: 
  Yea.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:18.179 --> 0:22:31.949]: 
  I don't know what I'm like lining up the fucking top. This is where you hear like that tron, that tron buzz, just like... Ooooooh. The scary. I watched in terror, and my favorite monkey hero got torn to shreds and was screaming in agony.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:31.949 --> 0:22:34.530]: 
  I couldn't help but cry.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:34.530 --> 0:22:40.538]: 
  My little as I saw Donkey Kong's rib cage burst open by Kin K rules

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:39.407 --> 0:22:59.995]: 
  That's what I saw, I screamed, I turned the game off, I started it back, I reset the game, I tried to pull it up but I couldn't, I decided to give it a go. All that appeared on the screen was a photo-realistic dead monkey with flies buzzing around the edge. And a tiger poorly photoshopped on his body. If someone could really kill the monkey and put a tie on it, I didn't know what to do.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:59.995 --> 0:23:32.445]: 
  grasps at my heart, it started to be faster and faster. Suddenly the pictures zoomed out and I was greeted to the Nintendo opening from the GameCube game Luigi's Mansion. You know the one, Nintendo. The zoom out suddenly showed that the banana horn wasn't what I remembered it. The bananas were rotten, dripping with booze of some kind. And the face, well, that was actually a face that was stabbed by a stick. All the other King Kong heads on the wall. You know, stinky Kong.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:32.445 --> 0:23:35.939]: 
  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:35.939 --> 0:23:46.283]: 
  Chris is right at the top, Chris is right in the cookie clogs. They were all dead, ripped apart in the purple king kool, hoarding over his hoard of bananas.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:23:40.680 --> 0:23:41.204]: 
  They were all dead.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:48.004 --> 0:23:56.948]: 
  Make it loud static You're dying No, no, no, I got a good ending Needless to say, I shit my pants I joke

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:53.995 --> 0:23:56.999]:

  Yeah, I'm a two year old, say that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:58.416 --> 0:24:11.005]: 
  What? I'm two year old saying any of this! Yes dude. It was not this. Fine. As long as he's making references to a fucking GameCube game, like 15 years ago.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:11.005 --> 0:24:23.948]: 
  Fine, he shit his diaper. Fuck it, jumped up, ran back to his room, crying. He went back to go tell his friend what had happened. Wait, what? Are you talking to a third person? Were we talking to a first person? Yes!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:11.815 --> 0:24:13.215]:

  Why? You're okay, hold on. Okay, I should keep that in. Oh, yeah. I shit myself. I've- I've choked up shit everywhere.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:15.938 --> 0:27:25.709]: 
  It is. I know there's a white noise of New York City. If you live in New York City and you have a television, you're going to have signs. It's on every night. Every night. So you're saying like the whole night. So yeah, it's all but...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:17.001 --> 0:27:18.891]:

  We're gonna have signs for you. It's on every day.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:23.650 --> 0:28:15.439]: 
  So yeah, so but like if you watch Kerber like a show about a celebrity It's usually like the celebrities are really petty kind of you know Neurotic neurotic petty people like they're successful But they're still like they're really petty but stuff like a dollar They'll squabble over like a nickel or something Rob Schleider did not get that memo. His show is about how famous he is how cool he's and how rich he is And so the sneak peek on YouTube is he's like it really piqued my interest I was like what's this? And it's he goes to like a coffee shop and the guy's like okay Here's your coffee. He's like when you go to me and Rob's like what I get you five dollar tip He's like no, I need more. They're famous. You could you could be a hundred dollars The rupture letter goes I can give you a thousand dollars, but I'm not gonna do that either I was like whoa fucking real goes off like ten minutes And he says it ends with him it ends with him He says yeah He says I'm gonna go back to my two million dollar house in my hundred fifty thousand dollar car and sleep with my hot 29 year old wife he leaves and I was like this will be fucking good And so I look through do it more and he comes back then because it gives him a

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:30.737 --> 0:27:31.530]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:37.994 --> 0:27:39.023]: 
  I hope you like it that much.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:59.391 --> 0:28:02.125]: 
  It goes off like 10 minutes and he says...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:14.747 --> 0:28:19.506]: 
  And it gives him a $20. Gives him a 20. Yeah, he's a hero on top of that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:16.232 --> 0:28:18.494]: 
  He's a hero.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:18.494 --> 0:28:22.814]: 
  on top of that. It's what you're so aware of, right? We're supposed to say what an idiot. Yeah, no, no, no.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:19.506 --> 0:28:21.261]: 
  That's because you're gonna be self-aware, right?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:22.307 --> 0:28:40.735]: 
  Yeah, no, no, no, but like it's not that kind of character like oh this guys you really believe that's how right It's cuz he wrote it like you know in Louie. It's like he's like you know doing well for himself and stuff But he still has a shitty horrible life like that's what makes it funny. You simply curve. It's like you're supposed to relate But he literally gives like the most like petty neurotic we know that's what's enjoyable

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:26.526 --> 0:28:28.028]: 
  It's because he wrote it. Like you know what Louis?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:27.437 --> 0:28:27.994]: 
  You know what Luke?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:32.939 --> 0:28:34.997]: 
  Like that's what makes it funny.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:28:34.997 --> 0:28:37.005]: 
  It's like you're supposed to relate rich but he

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:37.005 --> 0:28:37.579]: 
  We'll give it a try.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:40.650 --> 0:28:41.950]: 
  the guy that you like the comedian?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:41.950 --> 0:28:58.504]: 
  Nor McDonald's. This is the saddest part. That was terrible. I think we say this. I think Nor McDonald's is one of the funniest comedians of all time. One of the most underrated comedians of all time. I've never seen him ever do anything. I've never seen him do anything. He plays in a chicken van. Absolutely. You see chicken van? What the fuck does that mean?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:42.726 --> 0:28:44.937]: 
  This is the saddest part.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:28:44.937 --> 0:28:45.831]: 
  That's just like, with...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:45.831 --> 0:28:46.439]: 
  I think

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:46.439 --> 0:28:46.793]: 
  We see this.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:48.767 --> 0:28:49.510]: 
  ANTHONY GAVES YEAH

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:51.299 --> 0:28:54.269]: 
  I've never seen him ever do anything.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:58.200 --> 0:29:02.217]: 
  I like how you started with exactly, like you were like I was so afraid of you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:58.504 --> 0:28:58.555]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:59.382 --> 0:29:01.440]: 
  Exactly, like you were late?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:01.440 --> 0:29:04.495]: 
  I could just be like, yes, Corey.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:03.634 --> 0:29:06.824]: 
  Corey, we're looking for a board. We're putting some board in different ships.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:04.495 --> 0:29:16.881]: 
  Oh lord, but he's a chicken man. He's a different ship dude. I'll tell you, he's like, I look at his eyes and he believes him so I believe him. I was like, oh yeah, naturally, he's just a chicken man. And then I saw the field core of his eyes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:16.881 --> 0:29:20.459]: 
  But it finally struck me how it's like. Like, Cory realized what he said. And he cleared up all the questions.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:17.995 --> 0:29:36.929]: 
  What I've clearly realized what he said He created a monster You were on a ship around the freaking Manhattan Islands Cory was on a ship to fucking Mars He was not this planet but Norwegdottled, where the face could never done anything bad ever Until I saw this, it's the saddest thing ever I know, that hurt me in my heart Everything's ever been in

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:34.482 --> 0:29:38.937]: 
  Yeah, I ever ever been in be fair and look like you watch the clip

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:38.059 --> 0:31:27.477]: 
  You watch the clip it's it's Rob Schneider the story is Rob Schneider What's he gonna have a second to me or whatever and the gag is that Rob Schneider is worried that it has to do with like memory loss Or to me it leads to dementia or something and he's all my friend. Oh, we don't look at a perspective I'll talk to him and he goes to like a diner with the shitty like not curbing enthusiasm music was trying to be that And he sits on the McDonald and normally just sitting there He just looks so tired and he never moves his eyes are staring directly straight They never move and he delivered I can tell you can just feel it No, it doesn't really get like improv comic you can tell he's read up a script Yeah, I preach what happened was he started doing a problem I was like no do the fucking script because you just sit there like with no Oh, he was making a point with the passive point. Yeah, you want me to read every word just as is fine That's what you got really really bad. Yeah, he's sitting there with a stick up his ass. You see like yeah anyways Yeah, he does not want to be there But the most interesting thing about that show you can tell immediately when you watch it is I'm pretty sure this was Rob Schneider's choice I think it was eyes the pop because he's blue eyes So the the saturation is fucking blasted Yeah, so all of the blues are super super blue his eyes Everyone is doing as like slightly green blue eyes has vibrant blue eyes Yeah, all the origins of blues are super turned off like the shots of LA look really nice Which is hey, you know, it's not right But the show so even more baffling the show is the first thing is it's a Netflix original But there's no it's the only that picture never seen with zero Netflix brandy There's no Netflix original on it. I look it up. It's pushed to the back of Netflix and when they start There's no commercials. It just starts the episode looking barris by They want to look at norm at that YouTube red carpet thing is the funniest video Yeah, if you're at home type in Norm MacDonald kill you on YouTube It's it's him with the YouTube carpet red carpet thing comedy week comedy week He's with like Kassim G. It's whether youtuber and he does he's looking sweatpants. He's something Care all the time

  and it hurts.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:05.730 --> 0:34:07.992]: 
  You know what I mean? Because even if you're good at it, it's what's important.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:07.992 --> 0:34:15.501]: 
  three episodes. Even if you are self aware and you're making fun of the fact, you're making fun of yourself in certain ways, I feel like the fact that you're

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:14.505 --> 0:34:34.536]: 
  I feel like the fact that you're still promoting the idea that you are this super rich guy with this super awesome car and the super hot wife, no matter how much you trash yourself or you know whatever, make fun of yourself, that's still the main focus.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:25.339 --> 0:34:26.942]: 
  That's still the main boat.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:26.942 --> 0:34:27.853]: 
  He's trying to do his way.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:30.149 --> 0:34:31.143]: 
  We like our try

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:32.899 --> 0:34:36.949]: 
  Did you see that episode where he runs over a black guy?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:34.992 --> 0:34:35.447]: 
  where he was.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:36.848 --> 0:34:44.442]: 
  He runs with his- And it's just really creepy how- Like how the black guy is just there like a blood covered over his face and the cops keep talking to him, telling him-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:36.882 --> 0:34:38.603]: 
  He goes where he's without his cars.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:43.496 --> 0:34:46.500]: 
  keep talking to him telling him how funny he is and do his

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:46.382 --> 0:34:53.436]: 
  Yeah, they're like, wow, rups, can I get a selfie with you? Are you okay? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:46.500 --> 0:34:47.918]: 
  இது காத்தியாடு சகு.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:53.436 --> 0:34:56.929]: 
  a glass of water you're so funny you're so funny that's what

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:55.495 --> 0:35:07.949]: 
  Yeah, you're so funny. Is that supposed to be the joke though? Because no one would actually ever say that to him? I'm not trying to be an asshole, but Shed and I were talking about this earlier. When it comes to Rob Schneider, it's not like... I know very few people that hate him, but I don't

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:56.339 --> 0:34:56.744]: 
  He's dead.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:57.722 --> 0:35:02.464]: 
  because no one would ever say that to him like I'm not trying to be an asshole but Jen and I were talking about this

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:07.493 --> 0:35:40.197]: 
  But I don't know a single person that would ever say I want to grow up to be the next Rob Schneider Or like or like my favorite guy in that movie Rob Schneider I'll say this nobody's nobody's said his name It dearly like 20 years. It's always like we have Rob Schneider Yeah, those are some those are some Rob Schneider in like a good way like a long time I bet I know him that South Park episode had a lot to do with this like episode made him into an actual joke But he's always been an asshole there's no he's always been an asshole right but nobody really cared or knew Yeah, but then that episode came in was like Derpy derpy derpy and then now he's like I'm not a joke and he makes that show

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:20.436 --> 0:35:21.179]: 
 多謝 多謝

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:22.090 --> 0:35:23.980]: 
  Like a good way like a log time

 SPEAKER_04 [0:35 --> 0:35:31.354]: 
  So made him into an actual joke, but he's always been an asshole. There's no he's always been an asshole, right?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:32.569 --> 0:35:34.949]: 
  But then that episode came in and I was like, ahhh!

 SPEAKER_04 [0:35:35.843 --> 0:35:36.501]: 
  I didn't know

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:36.501 --> 0:35:50.035]: 
  I'm not a joke and he makes that show. I think that's what it is. Exactly. Have you seen the tagline of the episode? That he's a comedian who is more funny off-camera? Because instead this is the real raw material. The best thing is that it does.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:43.673 --> 0:35:44.129]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:45.934 --> 0:35:48.516]: 
  Because it's dead, this is the real raw talk of the day.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:48.516 --> 0:36:58.699]: 
  The best thing about it though is that every episode has two or three pilots where he's doing the Louis thing Or the side-fell Louis thing where he's in front of a brick wall But it's like a shitty obviously he's like plastic brick wall and he's very obviously not in the audience Like he's not telling jokes to anybody. Does he really do the same thing Louis does? Yes Come on dude. But he'll like do the bit from like the episode But I really would kill to see the raw footage of him with like white noise like people coughing No Shitty like he's just in front of a fucking fake like like Like you know what Louis like like directs that and he starts and he edits it to like I wonder does Rob Like do anything I think he he said was self-funded But if you look at interviews with it the whole thing is just fucking strange He did like eight episodes one with the billboard. Yes. Keep stressing He got half a million dollars to be in an ad the fact that dude So the point he's talking when he like does this weird like Chinese erectile dysfunction You sure this is not gonna be in America, right? He goes like no no no It would not be in America He's a kid his young payment and they're like at a conference with cameras and the Chinese guy pulls out a bag of cash Of happy million dollars in cash. I was like Rob Schleider. That has never happened to you Who the fuck pays a cash you weirdo

 SPEAKER_04 [0:35:55.755 --> 0:35:56.481]: 
  Bro, it's okay.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:01.493 --> 0:36:01.577]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:04.260 --> 0:36:05.003]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:05.003 --> 0:36:05.644]: 
  But he'll like

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:07.281 --> 0:36:07.635]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:07.551 --> 0:36:07.669]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:12.799 --> 0:36:14.706]: 
  no other one

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:17.895 --> 0:36:19.110]: 
  That's not bad. That's not bad at all. That's not bad at all. Like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:21.220 --> 0:36:23.076]: 
  Yeah, yeah. And he edits it too.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:23.076 --> 0:36:24.730]: 
  I wonder does Rob like do anything? I think.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:29.573 --> 0:36:30.940]: 
  So that one with the billboard.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:30.940 --> 0:36:31.750]: 
  Word. Yes!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:56.995 --> 0:37:01.450]: 
  It's almost like the opposite. Do you ever see extras?

  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like one of the guests from X-rays.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:08.301 --> 0:37:29.496]: 
  adding like white noise to something. It's kind of like when people take the big bank theory and remove all the laughing. So it's just like these creepy people fighting each other. But there's another one that's really bizarre that Lexi showed me. She showed me Full House without that. What's that little girl's name? The Olson twins? Yeah, there's two of them. Mary Kay and Ashley. Which one was the one that was the most popular? Mary Kay. Mary Kay.

  They're like, they're like, they're one character in the show. Yeah, yeah, there was like one girl on it. Is that really, is that fucking weird? There were one choice for them, they just alternated babies. But the little one that like, oh, I didn't know that. Yeah, it's fucking up.

  It'll work.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:34.491 --> 0:38:05.389]: 
  But the little one that like oh, I didn't know that but the little one that the humor revolved around Yeah, they made an episode where they completely cut her out and he's just like talking to like nothing He's like I think are saying Mary or Mary or Kate. I'll be here. Like hey Kate What do you have to say about this? I think there's just like no audio He's like we'll have to talk to some people about it's just like the girl comes in like the one of the little older girls And she's just like she's just like I forget what his name is. He's like, um, what's his actual? So like do what you're saying is the

  I don't play it. I'm going so fast.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:02.504 --> 0:38:09.945]: 
  I'm going so black dude. What you're saying is that the whole show revolves around bouncing like humor off the little kids. Yes, and when you don't see it...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:08.393 --> 0:38:25.926]: 
  Yes, and when you don't see it, it's like there's this one creepy scene where he picks up like this invisible air That's like Photoshop moving around And he's like what do you gotta say about that? And she says some stuff and then like they're all laughing they're like, ah, she's funny that girl is funny But there's like nobody there. There's no audio or it's just complete silence.

  That girl is funny.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:24.930 --> 0:39:14.256]: 
  The only reason she was so like this cuz she was the sex object That was talking about Zach was saying that he'd like to see the raw footage where it's just like Rob will make a joke and be like oh blah blah blah and then like you'll hear the compressor of the auto Yeah, let's say let's say I would say I would see that I would get the camera just here be like yes Oh my wife is Mexican. Yeah, and then here like that's a dead silence. You hear that compressor go Yeah, here's to be like Here the real fucking audio But it's wife is the funniest part of the show she's like she's always her tits on every shot and she's like Rob, what are you want to do today? She talks like she's like from Mexico, Mexico I'm not being racist. I'm not being racist. The first shot of the first episode is damn it laying in bed And there's a large spotlight above them and she's like let me turn the light on she turns the lamp on like wait the light wasn't on

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:28.947 --> 0:38:30.347]: 
  That's what we're talking about.

  You hear the background noise cut in?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:49.500 --> 0:38:53.939]: 
  He would just hear him like coughing and then he would be like eating the joke like no no no. Hold on let me do that.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:38:53.939 --> 0:38:55.947]: 
  Yeah, okay, we're gonna do that one again.

  Thank you so much for the show.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:03.152 --> 0:39:05.582]: 
  I don't think it's interesting.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:14.189 --> 0:39:18.711]: 
  I was supposed to be the dark bro with a big fucking spotlight about it. I was like holy shit.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:16.399 --> 0:39:20.972]: 
  I was like holy shit, it's a perfect way to set the whole tour to the show.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:20.145 --> 0:39:21.934]: 
  Maybe they forgot to color correct me

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:21.816 --> 0:39:27.385]: 
  No, because they call it... Look at his eyes! His eyes are like... Like, this is the color that's a lot of on. Dude, sometimes he has like...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:39:25.714 --> 0:39:30.591]: 
  Sometimes he has like white stuff around his eyes. Yeah, he's like decaying

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:28.785 --> 0:40:53.414]: 
  Yeah, he's like the cake the worst thing is though the makeup you can see where the makeup cuts off at his neck Yes, it actually looks creepy. He looks like a corpse. He was Like bizarre scene where he makes fun of the retardic guy as a mind yes I think I get like a point in the face. There's no point that show I don't even get the joke of that ever get us come up in sir or no He's punchy web so it doesn't really matter But yeah, there's one see there's one seeds where you're like wait what what just happened you have to rewind you like Why did that happen? Yeah, what is the joke? We're like genuinely confused. He's gonna start making fun of a retarded guy for no reason. Yeah, he's Why did you do the guy the context is a retarded guy a mentally disabled guy walks up from he's never been this Before and Rob immediately starts making fun of him for no reason. That's pretty funny But you know, it's just weird. It's like wait it has no view of the plot Funny because it's like that makes him look really bad. Yeah, but I think it hits and he was like, oh, this would be like You see what his real side of his real stand-up that he does now all of the jokes are about how he goes out of sailor He has what wait what how he was How he knows him? Oh, how is it because that I'm saying there's one bit was like Adam sailor called me up and said I'll let you do a little part for me. He I was like what's the line?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:57.632 --> 0:41:06.154]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:04.635 --> 0:41:29.256]: 
  I'm seeing this rap again, but look at it, it's really funny this part. But the funniest part about all of this, the cherry on top, is that I talked about it on Twitter, I even tweeted a Rob Schneider. I tweeted about the show. I didn't type in Rob Schneider, type in real Rob, Rob Schneider, whatever. I think he, and I was blocked. So pretty sure he types his own name on Twitter and finds people to get mad at and blocks them. What did you say about it? I said the show is terrible. Oh. And I think he blocked me because of that. He seriously blocked you because of that? I was actually heartbroken.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:22.253 --> 0:41:23.704]:

I follow like that guy, TJ, the amazing atheist, sounds like that. And he tweeted someone that's like, I don't think I've ever met anyone not blocked by Steve Shives. I was like, who the fuck is Steve Shives? And I clicked on his profile and I was blocked.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:34.690 --> 0:41:35.162]: 
  That was the idea.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:41:40.191 --> 0:41:40.883]: 
  That was me too.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:47.954 --> 0:41:53.607]:

I don't know if this got popular, but people are taking fucking Hillary Clinton and putting her in videos where people are like, You're a fucking horrible piece of shit. You're a dumb, stupid fucking broad. And she's just like laughing and stuff. She's like, I agree with that. It's really funny. There was one picture I saw of Hillary Clinton.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:41.995 --> 0:43:53.942]: 
  There was one picture I saw of Hillary Clinton when I don't know if it was if somebody photoshopped it or if it was just the angle But there was somebody holding a sign that says like I'm with Trump or something and she's standing in front of the sign

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:44.982 --> 0:43:45.319]:

  I know that picture.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:00.827 --> 0:44:10.007]: 
  That is a photoshop. Because she sees this person and she's like HAAAAAA Is this just a new thing where you put her in a compilation where she's laughing and people like me

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:10.007 --> 0:44:14.580]: 
  I have recently heard about the Ursula. I noticed that I was watching.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:13.281 --> 0:45:05.189]: 
  I noticed that I was watching, I was watching some CNN, like Paul's some CNN thing and they like posted like some town hall It just clips up like 10 second clips of them and they showed her a clip of Stephen Colbert like yelling at her And she's trying to like act like she's being a sport. She goes Ah ha ha! She laughs, she laughs identically to Ursula from The Little Mermaid and I played it back to back She sounds, no she sounds the same. It's fucking disturbing. You know like those reptilian theories with her you almost want to believe it because she seems like an artificial human being She does it. She seems like a robot. Yeah like someone made her and thought that's what she was like. You know I think the best, she's the best thing that happened to like all political parties. Everyone hates the revolt political parties. Democrats, Republicans. Oh, I am. She's so hateable. I am so angry. But if she's a nominee for the Democrats and Trump is a nominee, Trump, Donald Trump, I see this right now on the podcast Donald Trump might be the president and there's a good chance of him having an aide. The idea that he's a candidate for the Democrats is that he's not a candidate for the Democrats. But he's not a candidate for the Democrats.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:32.063 --> 0:44:32.080]:

  He does it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:44.888 --> 0:44:48.415]: 
  Yeah, like someone made her and thought that's the only thing she'd be like.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:53.174 --> 0:44:55.384]: 
  She's so hate-able. I am so proud of her. Sit on Twitter, butt.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:05.189 --> 0:45:09.542]: 
  Donald J Trump will be the president! WOOOOO!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:09.542 --> 0:45:15.280]: 
  So you know, you know in South Park when they were talking about like if McCain wine or Obama wine we're gonna move

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:13.879 --> 0:45:22.789]:

Let me clear up why it's scary You know I get to get to fucking see it in here But the biggest things are Donald Trump gets a lot of the independent vote which is like what Bernie Sanders is stealing right now So if it's just her she loses a lot of the independent vote But also she he has all the Republican vote or the majority of it a lot of the independent vote and Democrats historically vote a lot less so it wouldn't take more votes It would take less votes for her like I'm a Democrat But I don't think I'd vote for her because I don't like her so it would just take less people voting for her and a lot of people supporting him That's all it's a I think it's scary enough just that he's this him on the his fucking face His only face on the ballot is scary alone What happened? He never like answers a question they're like what how would you defeat I see I would kill them so hard they wouldn't see it coming They'd be dead He doesn't believe you can do it I believe he really thinks he can do it because he was raised rich He like he did well for himself obviously, but he's also had a couple failures here No, he whenever he fails at anything is well documented.

  Why would you do that?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:16.815 --> 0:54:23.397]: 
  I love that. What surprises me more than the people making the videos is the fact that there are audiences for these videos.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:23.009 --> 0:54:31.935]: 
  I watch it out of morbid curiosity to see how somebody can do something like that. Like the cinnamon challenge sucks and watching someone try and actually and successfully swallow it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:31.935 --> 0:54:43.950]: 
  Cinnamon yeah, I see those again, but like watching somebody like 10 fucking chickens I'm not Donald's just said and not succeed. They don't see that in the house. You've got like yeah It's like that's the thing on top of everything else

 SPEAKER_04 [0:54:36.002 --> 0:54:37.504]: 
  I'm like, yeah, that's fucked up.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:36.492 --> 0:54:40.457]: 
  And not succeed.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:40.002 --> 0:54:40.373]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:43.950 --> 0:54:50.447]: 
  You all you did was watch somebody fail and stuff their face. It's like they embarrassed themselves

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:48.608 --> 0:54:58.969]: 
  It's like they embarrassed themselves. They still ate 7 chicken sandwiches for $1 but they did do anything right. All they did was eat 7 chicken sandwiches. I saw one of those videos years ago and I was laughing about it. Where's this the guy's like

 SPEAKER_04 [0:54:54.936 --> 0:54:55.155]: 
  first

 SPEAKER_04 [0:54:58.227 --> 0:54:58.345]: 
  First

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:58.345 --> 0:55:01.956]: 
  Is this the guy's like I want to do like 50 chicken puppercut like I see that

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:00.859 --> 0:55:06.175]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:04.994 --> 0:55:07.002]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:06.175 --> 0:55:06.327]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:07.002 --> 0:55:11.693]: 
  then there's like something crazy if they just admit defeat and turn off the camera

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:10.343 --> 0:55:23.860]: 
  This guy specifically that I thought all he does is he like breathes heavily a bucket readjusty shirt It's like the same as being like I'm gonna show you how to do this cheat in Super Mario

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:14.984 --> 0:55:16.941]: 
 ...chosen Chotis C Lead.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:55:16.452 --> 0:55:17.582]: 
  I mean, it's like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:20.215 --> 0:55:27.994]: 
  Yeah, and then it doesn't work. And then you're like, what did I just spend all this time doing? Yeah, it's like, and then he turns it off, and you're like, why is that on the internet? Yeah, it puts it in the foot-sucking list. Unless you puke.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:24.450 --> 0:55:25.446]: 
  tiny

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:26.020 --> 0:55:51.147]: 
  Yeah, unless you puke when he's showing you the code, at which point you know there's some value. If we're talking about Shunice, there's a video where he goes in the park with this homeless woman and he has two cheeseburgers and he gives her one cheeseburger and he's like, I'm Shunice. And then he eats the fucking burger in front of her and she just looks at him like he's disgusting to me. She's just looking at him like disgusted and then he's like, thank you, but she doesn't even want it. She's like holding it down lower.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:27.994 --> 0:55:31.437]: 
  from showing you the code, at which point the other sum value...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:50.117 --> 0:55:53.442]: 
  Why did he get her involved?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:52.632 --> 0:55:54.471]: 
  Das müsste vorher sehr protected werden.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:53.003 --> 0:56:03.465]: 
  He's just a freak dude. He has drug binges and then he tries to make terrible shows and he's like, I need your money and then he just openly says, I spent it all. It's weird, I was watching you say that.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:56.277 --> 0:55:56.834]: 
  because like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:01.947 --> 0:56:20.003]: 
  It's weird. I was watching his stuff because of course you looked back like in 2011 or 10 or something back when he was like He he has a wife and kid he used to live with them. Yeah, if you watch the news from the start He's like hey guys This is me shoe nice and he did his wife peaks and do that to the garage and he moves out and you can watch his life Degrade slowly. Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:06.435 --> 0:56:06.503]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:20.003 --> 0:56:49.500]: 
  There was this one point where he was so low in the barrel where he was like sitting there with like He was in a room where there was a blanket over his head Like he had a fucking like a child's fort was over him and he's like I want to make a show It's because he was like hi or something like I'm sorry. I'm high But it's gonna be a can of soda and a pastry dish. Don't want adventures or something like that He's like and I need your help I need three hundred dollars immediately It's such a modest number too $300

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:24.492 --> 0:56:25.504]: 
  He was in a room.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:56:25.504 --> 0:56:26.989]: 
  where there was a blanket over it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:42.734 --> 0:56:43.493]: 
  That was good.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:56:43.493 --> 0:56:46.497]: 
  and he was like, he was like, he was like, he was like, he was such a modest number too.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:46.497 --> 0:56:55.947]: 
  $300 Exactly the exact amount for like the fucking yeah the weekend

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:49.500 --> 0:56:52.049]: 
  More drugs. Exactly, the exact amount.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:53.939 --> 0:56:58.444]: 
  I'm not a fat and heroin infotainee. And at that point I was like, alright, bye. Sorry forever.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:55.947 --> 1:02:32.451]: 
  I was like, alright, bye, sorry forever. See you later. Oh, man. I have an interesting story that happened during- Oh, do you have a story? I've had a story. What's happened? Interesting story? We've told our fair share of drunk stories on the podcast, but I think this one even tops myself, which is fun to believe. So, about a week ago, you know, as we do, Nikki and I, it's one of the people, a few other artists, decided about drinking, not the bad part. You usually say as we do, I can say that. As we do, as we do drink. Not the bad part, but decided to have a few more drinks, and this is where things got bad. I'll cut the drinking part out because I'd be just drunk. Nikki was like, I'm gonna go back home. I feel tired. I was like, alright, give my keys to my apartment, which is this one here. She walks back, she leaves. I stay behind for a little bit longer with John. We drink a little bit more. We decide to leave, we go, we walk back to his place. Nikki is lost in it. So, she walked back, the other two people there, back to John's place, left, trying to find the bar that she left to come back to the bar, got lost one block from here. John's having a, he's like, okay, don't leave here, I'll be right back. This is the only part of Black down it, but I don't really have to say that. I came to, and I decided to walk back to my place. The fact that I got back at all is a miracle. I walked back from John's place to my place, I walked back. Those two go back to his place. They assume I'm gonna come back, they don't know that I was walking somewhere. I walked back here, I think Nikki's here, because I don't realize she was lost. She has my keys. I walked back to my lobby, like four, maybe six a.m. I buzzing my own fucking building, my own door, for playing, to me I thought it was 30 minutes, and then I realized the time was probably a little longer. Yeah, it was probably five minutes. No, I'm drunk, I'm very, very drunk. To the point where I did Black out for like 10 minutes, but I'm not wasting any more, I'm kind of coming to you a little bit. Buzzing, buzzing my door, I puked from a lack of water in the fucking lobby, everywhere I hurled. This is the hour people started to go to work. I don't remember seeing anybody, but I'm pretty sure somebody saw me, because the police came. I don't think I was, I would, I'd always be disturbing, I was being loud, but I think somebody saw me puke, and they're like, oh, this guy puked. This bald cop and his partner bring me out, they're like, sir, have you had some drinks tonight? And I was like, yeah, you know, I have. And my girlfriend's up there, she's sleeping. And she told me, I think she's sleeping. That's what I thought. She has my keys, and they're like, yeah, wear your keys. I was like, she has them. And they said, where's your phone? And I was like, oh, it's right, didn't have my phone. I was like, it sounds like a lie, but really, my phone's not with me, she has my phone and my keys. She has them, I live right here. Here's my address, here's my license, here it is, I live here. Please just let me in the building, I'll go from the room and go to sleep. I just want to sleep, I said that. And they said, sir, I don't believe you live here, because I haven't got my license updated yet, so I still have some Kansas Auditory. So I thought I was just some fucking crazy drunk who wanted to have puked at some lobby here. And I was like, fine, my friend's just right there, let me go there, I'm like, sir, I don't think you should. They're like, you're still here, by the way. Your girlfriend lives here, she's out on your way, she's pissed off at you. Did you hurt her? Did you guys have a fight? I was like, no, hold on, hold on. Did you rape her? Did you murder her? Did you murder her? Maybe she's not answering, because she's dead. They were, they were in the city, did you hit her, did you smack her? Did she say? That'd be the best Twitter drama ever. They were in the city, like rapes and murders. They fucking would say they beat her, or they'd kill her, I was like, I was like, kind of drunk, but I was like, hold on, hold on. And they're like, you know what we're gonna do, we're gonna call the ambulance, I was like, listen, I've been through this before, I do not have insurance. If you get an ambulance here, I will not go in it, not to be resisting, I respect police greatly. And I said, I swear to God, I'm not just, so you know what I mean? I'm not just saying this, I am not just saying this from my perspective to make myself look better, I will tell you everything that I did. I will pay myself, I will lick the holy Bible. Do you swear to crack little touch wood? I swear to Jesus on crackers, in toast. And so, I literally said, because I do believe genuinely that police, overall good police get a bad rap. And I said like, look, you guys have a hard job, I get it, you guys are just doing your job here, right? I'm some drunk guy, I'll be without my keys, and without my phone, I get it. Oh, here's the fucked up, I said, can you call my phone for me? Please, I gave my phone number, and they're like, we're not gonna do that, sir. We're not gonna, I was like, if you call my phone, you could probably, or if you could wait for my friend's house, like we could knock on the door or something. No, didn't do it. So I said like, I do not have insurance, if you take me to the hospital, I will not pay the insurance, I will not pay the bill because I cannot pay the bill. Please do not do that, I just wanna go to bed. And like I said, I said like, look, I get your resume, do your job, I respect you guys, I respect the police, represent NYPD. I think you said all of that too. I was going, I was going, I'm gonna be, wait, I'll be very courteous. And they said, sir, do not be, they started getting more students, they said, sir, do not be difficult, get in the goddamn ambulance. And I was like, you don't understand, I do not have insurance, they said, I don't care, get in the ambulance. Now, I talked to this on Twitter a little bit, I got, this is where things get complicated, get in the ambulance, that's right here, and the guy, the guy in the ambulance, I don't know if he was NYPD or if he was a medical worker. And I'll tell you why, I don't know, because of his behavior, if he was a fucking EMT, I would be baffled, and I'll tell you why. So I have to believe he's NYPD, who just works in the back of the ambulance. But he wasn't uniform. So I get the ambulance, and I was telling this to this guy, I was saying, listen, dude, I told this guy, I don't have insurance, and he said, please let me go. He said, sit down and shut the fuck up, sit right there. And I sat down and he said, move over, move over, move over, get to the back. And I was like, all right, I was like, don't be an asshole, dude. I said that, I was getting mad now. And he was like, don't be fucking difficult with me, don't get a fucking attitude with me. And I said, dude, there's a fucking attitude, I just wanna get out of this ambulance. And he stood up, he said, I wrote on Twitter, he said, don't be fucking difficult with me. And I said, oh, be difficult, if you don't listen to me, and let me tell you what I'm trying to say. And he said, if you don't shut the fuck up, I'm gonna bash your fucking skull in. And I said, do it. Now, you know what I mean, I'm not a tough guy. But I was thinking, this guy, okay, what are the chances, this guy caves my fucking face, and I go to the hospital. I don't know what happened. I have enough of a following online to cause a stroke, and this guy finds a lease. I said, do it. What's your name, by the way? He said, oh yeah, whatever, you're a fucking tough guy. And as we were driving, he was like, no, what's your name? What's your fucking name? He was like, yeah, whatever, whatever.

So right there already they had no legal proof of anything all they had was what they saw with their eyes right and so Hold on the fact that they would even this is already I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure it is not legal if somebody refuses medical service Yeah, and they're elucid enough to recognize if I was like fine. I'll tell you for sure. I know for a fact

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:52.448 --> 1:02]:

  Which is, I could draw myself.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:03:19.313 --> 1:03:21.507]: 
  Did they ever breathalyze you? No. All right.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:21.507 --> 1:03:21.743]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:45.992 --> 1:03:51.409]: 
  to at least have a medical record of how drunk you are to then justify you having to do something.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:50.447 --> 1:04:30.795]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:00.032 --> 1:04:00.707]: 
  Did you get there?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:01.585 --> 1:04:03.407]: 
  I was too drunk to get it. So here's the thing.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:07.575 --> 1:04:09.516]: 
  I only really started

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:22.864 --> 1:04:24.299]: 
  Yeah, I know. Yeah, but like, you know what the...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:28.129 --> 1:04:28.956]: 
  They would have probably t-

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:30.104 --> 1:04:32.483]: 
  Did the cops follow or was it just the guy in the middle?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:32.129 --> 1:05:35.798]: 
  They led me in by my arm, and I was like, I don't want to be the asshole who's like I have my rights They were literally on you to the door of the They weren't like guiding but they weren't like pushing me but they guided me the guy made the ambulance No, but they guided you to the ambulance the ambulance drove you to the hospital Then the door of the ambulance open walk could you not have ran it was like super far away from where I was I know but you could have like ran between buildings and lost them or something I did not want to avoid the police they would attack on me, but they weren't there my point Well, that somebody was actually I'm pretty sure the idea why I did why the bashing space I do If I run away, then they have a reason to be to fucking hurt me and be rough then they can slip past my face to the concrete Be assholes so and I told the nurse I said nurse I will not pay the bill I told the people that when I pay the bill not gonna pay the bill I'll turn up. I'm not gonna pay the bill really good because I cannot afford it. I said I could afford it I don't want to be here. She's just drinking ginger ale sir And she said I tried to sleep because it was like 7 a.m. At this point I would love 8 a.m. I just wanted to fucking leave it gets me sleep and they're like if you fall asleep Be here the whole day. I was like, alright, whatever. Drake my ginger ale. They let me get dressed before I got dressed I wiped my fucking ass on the bed sheets because I was so mad

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:35.537 --> 1:04:37.444]: 
  I have my rights!

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:37.444 --> 1:04:39.942]: 
  They were literally on you to the door of the house

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:42.254 --> 1:04:43.840]: 
  No, but they got you just...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:45.865 --> 1:04:48.919]: 
  Then right or the ambulance open walk could you not have ran it was like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:50.370 --> 1:04:51.164]: 
  I know but you could have like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:52.632 --> 1:04:53.054]: 
 好 已经到了

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:54.488 --> 1:04:55.956]: 
  But they weren't there.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:57.863 --> 1:05:02.284]: 
  Why do you want to bash his face? I do I do I was fucking chasing if I run away

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:36.743 --> 1:06:08.080]: 
  It was that beautiful yellow shit too. It was the brown. It was yellow. I got dressed. I got dressed. I, with the most fucking sour expression in my face ever, I took a cab from the fucking upper east side, holding my belt, fucking stumbling around, all the way to John's place. I buzzed the door. I walked in and screamed for probably like 15 minutes. Screamed straight. They're like, where were you? I pulled my sleeve down and I showed the fucking fuck. They put a fall risk on Badger. Like, you know, it said fall risk. I give a fucking fall risk. Like, I give a turtle.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:41.097 --> 1:05:41.738]: 
  Margell?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:05.920 --> 1:06:09.784]: 
  forward like a toddler and fucking break his face he said we're really

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:09.075 --> 1:06:19.960]: 
  They said, what do I really like? Pull the net, I started screaming about what happened. And I fucking, I still have the little, the little suction cup marks on my, on my fucking chest with the little notes they put on. And so that was my fucking night.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:18.222 --> 1:06:32.852]: 
  So that was my fucking guide. It feels like at some point they have to have a code at that time of night for drunk people that they think are gonna be trouble. The cops call it in. The cops call it into the EMT like, hey we got a 347 which is like asshole.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:26.777 --> 1:06:29.494]: 
  The cops call it in. The cops call it into the EMT like...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:29.494 --> 1:06:30.507]: 
  Hey, we got a 346.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:31.249 --> 1:06:34.506]: 
  like asshole. Yeah. And everyone from the every, you know,

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:34.506 --> 1:06:39.889]: 
  from the fucking door of the building to the bed in the hospital, everyone's just gonna treat you like you're a crazy asshole.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:39.822 --> 1:07:16.947]: 
  But here's the- Oh, oh, here's the thing too, but the guy in the back of the- I was looking at the guy in the back of the ambulance. I was like, what's your fucking name? He was like, keep this up and put you in the psych ward. I was like, dude, I fucking deal you, such a pussy. Fucking- I'm not a tough guy. I'm not- I seriously might try to set- tell this to like, run your spec like it was tough. But I know if he did anything, he's a professional, he can get fired. I'm so important, who the fuck is gonna fire me? I guess I'm the one I want, you know? And that sounds weird, but I mean, in this context. So I was like, fucking do it, throw me in the psych ward for two weeks, I'll deal you. On what- on what ground? Like, they took a bash with Fasin? Go ahead. So here's a huge asshole. He looked like the fucking gay dad from American Beauty. The fucking big military guy who beats on his son. He had that kind of haircut and face. He was a big, sour asshole.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:16.947 --> 1:07:20.507]: 
  So did you end up getting a bill? I... Whenever they gave it, I ripped it up. I have to get the bill, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:18.482 --> 1:08:20.447]: 
  I, whenever they gave me a ripped it up I haven't got a bill yet. I'm gonna, I told like, if they really would pay the bill. Yeah, it might take like a month. I'll take it up to, I'll take it up to the same. Wait, did they ever get your address? I don't think so. Right, because they technically didn't even believe that you- If they bill me for whatever it is, I will take it up to the same. They can't. They didn't even believe you lived here. Yeah. But wouldn't they even get your address? Can's or something. Yeah, I'm not gonna pay it. They have no evidence of you being drunk at all. I mean, I puked, but that was not because I was so drunk. It was because I was locked in the lobby for fucking three hours of no water. You didn't know what to do about puking? Well, I puked because I was there for like two hours. I just got tired of it. I was like, dude, I wanna go, I wanna go inside. What's the puking for? Because you couldn't just walk outside and puk in the road? I was just sick. I was just sick. So, so here's what I was saying, right? I was not completely innocent. I was not some pedestrian walking tree gum. I puked in a lobby of a building. I was in the lobby for hours. I wasn't being loud. I get why the police came. That part's fine. The part that gets shitty is when they did that, call my phone, which by the way, they had it. John and Nicky and what else had my phone. They took it out of my pocket. See, this is the thing is that it could have been resolved at any few points. It's almost like they wanted to waste their time. They wanted to know me. They wanted something to do. I think so. They were bored and they were like, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:49.499 --> 1:07:50.697]: 
  Because you couldn't walk outside.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:11.234 --> 1:08:15.874]: 
  They took it out of my pocket. See, this is the thing is that it could have been resolved at any few points. It's almost like they wanted to

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:16.937 --> 1:08:17.950]: 
  They wanted to know me.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:17.950 --> 1:08:18.270]:

  bored and they were like, you know, we got eight hours to kill today.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:23.535 --> 1:08:42.621]: 
  But I should clarify that I'm not this like fuck the pigs guy. I'm not either. No. I'm not like I respect the state, I respect the police doing their job, I was drunk. But the way the EMT or whatever the guy that the ambulance was, I don't believe he was an EMT. There's no way that guy was a fucking health professional if he threatened to bash my face. So there was no one else, usually they had...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:27.636 --> 1:08:28.919]: 
  I'm not either. No.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:41.254 --> 1:08:44.444]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:48.747 --> 1:09:00.154]: 
  As soon as you get in the back, the very first thing they're doing is taking your temperature and They do that. And they take your blood pressure and especially if you've been puking or if you look sick, they will have water as well. Hey, just wait for me to be in the hospital to get my ticket bill.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:52.189 --> 1:08:54.450]: 
  They do it at that. I never had any pressure.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:57.926 --> 1:09:07.107]:

I want to go home to eat the razor brand. You're lucky you have this I'm really scared of like scammy places because like it's not like you have to be dumped to fall for a scam Like in Thailand there's a scam where you can rent a car or a bike and then they'll have someone from that building that works There follow you and rob you know I'm like key your car. So when you bring it back you got to pay for it

  During Halloween there's a lot of stories about like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:57.310 --> 1:10]: 
  Back when I was in college there were some stories about guys dressed as firemen who'd come to like, Halloween. They'd be going around knocking on doors, and because a lot of people have Halloween parties, they're not home.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10 --> 1:10:22.994]: 
  But then, you know, there's people running around in Costa Mac and stuff, but if you open the door and you're like a single female and you weren't at a party or whatever, they come and say that there was like a smoke thing or a gas thing, and they come into the apartment, they look around because they come in as a duo of guys, and they come in and look around the apartment, and if they notice that there was nobody to, you know,

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:22.994 --> 1:12:22.232]:

  Yeah, this is a vaccine. Thank you, artistic.

  Thank you, artistic. That's not fucking idiot.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:17.460 --> 1:26:30.032]: 
  That's what it's about to say. He's like, hey guys. I'd be like, the only way I would do that is if my character could be a living vaccination. But I would be like, and he's like, no, that causes autism. I can't spread the word. There's a little part happening to the movie.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:18.220 --> 1:26:19.992]: 
  He's like, hey guys.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:26:25.122 --> 1:26:25.999]: 
  that I would be like.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:25.999 --> 1:26:48.949]: 
  No, that causes autism. I can't spread the word. There's a weird part happening in the movie where Norman the North gets a vaccine and he turns autistic and clearly fucked up. And Rob Schuetter walks on the screen like black and white. He's like, listen, you will get autism if you vaccinate your kids. If you're making a show about yourself and you're painting yourself in such a great light, like you've clearly lost all humanity at that point. He's not human being anymore. He's just like a fucking robot.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:26:34.926 --> 1:26:36.782]: 
  A rough shadow walks on screen like this.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:37.238 --> 1:26:37.694]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [1:26:39.195 --> 1:26:40.866]: 
  I'm an藍 heroizer, convectionator kid

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:46.047 --> 1:26:47.447]: 
  He's like human being.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:48.949 --> 1:26:51.497]: 
  And that's why it's like the real Rob.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:51.497 --> 1:26:53.100]: 
  It's more like Reptile Loom.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:52.139 --> 1:26:56.897]: 
  rap loons what you're saying is that spares

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:53.995 --> 1:27:03.597]: 
  It's like yes. So whatever the rule is. What you're saying is the fact that he's anti-vaq and clearly has autism proves these points wrong. No, it's points of truth is right. You get vaccines. It's not normal.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:07.579]: 
  No, it was points of proof he's right, he could vaccines. He could vaccines. No, but that's what he's against. Oh, is it because he's against the vaccine?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:27:05.672 --> 1:27:23.526]: 
  Oh, is it because of the revan? He thinks they give you oxes. You know, people are like, I took my 5 year old baby and she was fine, I took her to get a vaccine, she got autism. Maybe that's what happened to the rupture later, like 15 years ago. Oh, you think just told him. He got like a flu vaccine, he just became autistic. Every vaccine. The doctor was like, don't be a thousand dollars.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:27:07.579 --> 1:27:07.900]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:27:09.030 --> 1:27:10.262]: 
  You know, people are like...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:27:15.966 --> 1:27:18.447]: 
  You think that oh

 SPEAKER_04 [1:27:20.387 --> 1:27:21.501]: 
  Every vaccine.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:27:21.501 --> 1:27:27.188]: 
  The doctor said there'll be a thousand dollars. He was like, what's wrong with all this? Just not what assistant people do.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:27:24.893 --> 1:27:35.440]: 
  What's wrong little tis- It's not what autistic people do. What's wrong? You autistic little bitch? Yeah, that vaccine was one of those blood tests. We felt for it. No, it's because Adam Sandler convinced him that let's get a fucking vaccination back today.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:27:30.495 --> 1:27:30.951]: 
 ิsnss

 SPEAKER_00 [1:27:33.229 --> 1:27:40.047]: 
  and give him a fucking vaccination back in the day and then he turned autistic and Adam Sandler's been trying to make up for his mistakes ever since but put it in front of him.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:27:35.440 --> 1:27:36.452]: 
  and then he turned on his

 SPEAKER_01 [1:27:37.482 --> 1:27:48.687]: 
  to make up for his mistakes ever since by putting all his problems.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:27:44.097 --> 1:27:45.987]: 
  Those were also running.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:27:44.502 --> 1:27:45.497]: 
  budget

 SPEAKER_02 [1:27:47.657 --> 1:28:07.047]: 
  The word autism lost all meaning. The blood clot is... It doesn't mean what people say it means anymore. I imagine we're all probably thinks about it. Yeah, it's really... Yeah, like, doesn't it just mean that you can't read social cues and that's... Is that it? Pretty much. From what I understand, it's like visually... There are levels of it though. Which kind of makes me feel like...

 SPEAKER_04 [1:27:50.492 --> 1:27:52.500]: 
  The blood clotting.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:27:51.960 --> 1:27:52.517]: 
  It doesn't mean it's not.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:27:54.374 --> 1:27:58.879]: 
  I imagine we're all probably things from... Yeah, it's really... yeah, like...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:28:00.398 --> 1:28:01.005]: 
  Is that it?

 SPEAKER_04 [1:28:01.005 --> 1:28:03.503]: 
  Pretty much, but what it's like it's officially

 SPEAKER_00 [1:28:03.503 --> 1:28:12.514]: 
  There are levels of it though. Which kind of makes me feel like everyone is autistic in some way. If you want to talk about social cues. Because there's plenty of situations.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:28:10.506 --> 1:28:29.997]: 
  Yeah, I think it's social cues and like emotional like like sympathy like levels of sympathy levels of like understanding basically So it's like you see like a dead dog. You're like you still understand Sociopathal like a 99.9% of the time on the internet when you see the word autistic They're not meaning it in that way. You're just saying you're stupid. Yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [1:28:15.130 --> 1:28:15.332]: 
  All right.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:28:17.357 --> 1:28:19.112]: 
  So it's like if you see like a dead

 SPEAKER_00 [1:28:20.344 --> 1:28:22.875]: 
  Yeah, well, yeah. So, is he a pathologist? 99.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:28:26.554 --> 1:28:27.499]: 
  You're just saying you're stupid.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:28:27.499 --> 1:28:29.237]: 
  Yeah, it's just easier.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:28:29.237 --> 1:28]: 
  But it's interesting because in some ways if you want to talk about like, oh you can't read social...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:28 --> 1:28:41.809]: 
  or whatever it's like if I don't like somebody it's rare but if I don't like somebody and I see them getting upset on film or something I literally will just deadpan it I will my heart

 SPEAKER_00 [1:28:34.485 --> 1:28:36.747]: 
  I don't like somebody, it's rare, but if I don't like somebody...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:28:39.464 --> 1:28:54.786]: 
  I literally will just deadpan it. I will, my heart, it's just like fucking static, you know, going through my head. If you were to gauge me at that moment, you'd be like, you have a problem. You were watching somebody confess their greatest fears and showcase their heart, and you do not give a shit. Yeah, that's what it's like. I think, I think it's like,

 SPEAKER_02 [1:28:53.385 --> 1:29:12.522]: 
  Yeah, that's funny. I think it's like on different levels. Like a lot of people who watch My Little Pony are like, I like it because people with who are autistic, they say they like it because... Oh, they're really good at animation. No, but they also say they like learn morals. Like, I didn't realize you weren't supposed to be on your mom. They don't just learn morals. They learn like social cues and stuff. That's what I'm saying. It's like when you spit on your friend, they might not like you anymore. It's like, oh! Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:29:00.085 --> 1:29:01.958]: 
  It's a really good animation.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:29:04.995 --> 1:29:07.020]:

There are people who are mature when they're like 13. They're like, oh you never show up your age. That person's probably gonna be like a fucking professor or something.
