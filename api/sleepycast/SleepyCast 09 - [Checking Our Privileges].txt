Nobody knows what we're talking about, so summarize from the start. Okay. Fuck the entire house over now. Alright, okay, about two months ago, alright, someone downloaded Workaholics, right? YOU! Wait, I was gonna see you. Download is going to get to that. That person was me. I admitted to that. I downloaded an episode of Workaholics to show Zach how bad it was, okay? Then, suddenly, He's pissed off all the Workaholics fans. About three weeks ago, No, well, like, some episodes- Somebody downloaded Frozen if you're a different dude. Yeah, you downloaded an entire season plus because you wanted to show somebody some bad- No, I did not. I downloaded episode 11-12 and like, the finale or whatever, right? Of season 3, which is a year old. Then, someone like, two weeks ago downloaded Agent Cody Banks. Saving Mr. Banks. Oh. The Tom- What was that? The Tom Hanks movie. Wait, did you really think it was Agent Cody Banks? I was confused. It's Saving Mr. Banks with Tom Hanks, dude. I thought it was Agent Cody Banks. Oh, there. Well, sorry. They're related. Well, someone downloaded what's called Mr. Banks. Saving Mr. Banks. Saving Mr. Banks. And that got us the second strike, right? Then, recently, our internet got cut off because they said that someone keeps downloading Torrance. I'm so bad. But today- Yeah, well, today, our internet got cut off so like- Explain why you feel partially guilty. I feel partially guilty because first, I committed the first strike. Third of all, I was seeding some Torrance so I think it might have been me this way. Who seeds Torrance? I accidentally forgot to- Exactly. A few weeks ago, I forgot to disable it. When you finished downloading it- I know. I didn't have a prompt and it's like, oh, that's selfish. That's selfish, though. Now when 15,000 people are seeding it, you don't have to worry about it. It's morning. Yeah, but if everyone has that- Guys, I grew up- This is illegal activity. I use, I use- Oh, fuck you! Don't- Just-

  topic go Zach when I talk about dogs versus cats right Zach dogs versus

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:40.727 --> 0:09:47.477]: 
  Dogs vs. Cats Well, if you put a dog in a cat in a big box, you mean dogs? Let's hear it. Let's hear it. You want to talk about dogs vs. cats?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:44.355 --> 0:09:50.110]: 
  Let's hear it. Let's hear it. You're talking about dogs versus cats. Dogs and cats or dogs versus cats? What?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:49.671 --> 0:11:18.450]: 
  What? It's exciting how we're right while the roosters are a little cat. No, no, no, you know, like, which is better. I've always thought cats are pretty fucking water-less. Myself, they're cute, but they're water-less. Yeah, they are. They are. That's true. Stamper, you said something that always stuck with me. You said cats are like house plants. And I never forgot that because it's exactly what they're like. They're like, house plants that are alive. They just walk around. It's true. Like, house plants are alive, but they just walk around. The difference between dogs and cats. I said that? Yeah. I drink a lot. I know. When you have a cat like house plants, it doesn't make sense. It does. When you sit there that you look at it like, oh, there's my fucking cat. You walk away. You can't pick up a cat and like... I'm probably going to offend a lot of people here, but like cats, they seem to like, they want what they'll suit themselves like they want food. So they'll come over to you and give you affection just so you'll get them food or pet them or whatever. It's not, they don't show you like love like dogs do. They're little manipulators. Yeah, they're like, oh, this human is here to serve me. Well, that's the thing. They're not smart enough to be little manipulators. They got little walnut brains. Yeah. The thing that bothers me the most about cats is when they come up to people and they say, my cat is really in tune with how I am right now. And she always comes up to me when I have a headache. I feel that we have a really good connect. Your cat is fucking retarded. They just sit through this black dead eye. Yeah. We have this. We have this. We have this. Are absolutely worthless animal. We have this cat called Sushi and if you look in her eyes at any given time, there's nothing. You can see there's nothing going on in her brain. Like nothing going on in her brain. Yeah. It's like they're both kind of looking to the side a little bit and they're just like, what? They don't have, they have no clue. They just want to shit and eat.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:50.768 --> 0:09:53.434]: 
  We're right while the roosters are a little kid.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:59.070 --> 0:10:00.505]: 
  They are, they are.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:00.505 --> 0:10:00.792]: 
  That's true.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:10.140 --> 0:10:12.469]: 
  The difference between dogs and cats. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:13.397 --> 0:10:15.861]: 
  I know. When you have a chance... That's like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:37.529 --> 0:10:38.001]: 
  That's what

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:42.372 --> 0:10:44.346]: 
  The things that bothered me the most about

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:51.467 --> 0:10:53.205]: 
  She always comes up to me when I have a headache.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:59.939 --> 0:11:02.048]: 
  Yeah, we have this. We have this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:10.182 --> 0:11:11.447]: 
  Like nothing going on.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:11.447 --> 0:11:13.118]: 
  Yeah, it's like there's

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:18.450 --> 0:11:27.765]: 
  Eat and fuck, that's it. I don't mind seeing another person's pet, or petting another person's pet, but yeah, I don't know. I can't see myself, besides being allergic, I can't see myself owning one because. Yeah, Jeff.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:27.209 --> 0:11:30.550]: 
  Yeah, Jeff is fucked up. He's allergic to anything. Yeah, I mean, if you...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:29.588 --> 0:11:35.140]: 
  Yeah, I mean if you if anybody out there wants to murder me lock me in the room the cat for 24 hours I'll be dead the next morning wait your dogs

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:34.364 --> 0:11:37.266]: 
  Wait, you're dogs, however. Are you literally dogs too? Dogs.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:36.287 --> 0:11:57.179]: 
  I think so yeah just Adam Dander in general. Oh man that sucks makes my fucking eyeballs swell up They like pop out of your head. It's it's a weird thing. I have contacts So like something happens or like my eye almost swells when my contact starts like shifting off my eye because my eyeball changes Shape or something I can't explain it really yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:39.645 --> 0:11:40.017]: 
  Man.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:55.812 --> 0:12:00.807]: 
  Really? Yeah, even like with sushi like if she's around it just happens or like is it

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:00.385 --> 0:12:02.595]: 
  No, I mean it takes a while. I have to like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:02.444 --> 0:12:09.902]: 
  Yeah, he'll come over for dinner or something and then he'll leave early. Yeah. It's just because he's around.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:08.991 --> 0:12:17.445]: 
  If I touch the cat and touch my eye, it's immediate, but if I if I breathe in the dander for a few hours If I go over to somebody's house with a cat then then it's what is that?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:16.922 --> 0:12:20.804]: 
  What is that? Is it like bacteria that lives on cats like fur or whatever? Or is it like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:20.550 --> 0:12:24.195]: 
  No, I think it's like the skin cells or something. The banner.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:23.335 --> 0:12:25.461]: 
  That's really weird. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:25.073 --> 0:12:26.271]: 
  Yeah, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:26.153 --> 0:12:55.364]: 
  A lot of people are allergic to that. It's a fiber they put out. There's a lot of cats that you could own. There's a couple of breeds of cats that you could own. If you're allergic to cats, you could own a Bangal cat. You had the hairless ones, right? You could own a Russian blue. Because their skin doesn't produce the... Those cats are good, but they're a little fucking... Causes allergic reactions. Their assholes, they bite you and stuff. Bangal cats are a pain in the ass, and they're expensive as fuck too. But if you really want a cat, then go for it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:37.898 --> 0:12:38.505]: 
  Parallel.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:38.505 --> 0:12:38.843]: 
  Okay?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:42.269 --> 0:12:43.517]: 
  I have skin doesn't.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:45.509 --> 0:12:46.437]: 
  Those cats are good for you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:46.437 --> 0:12:48.141]: 
  But they're a little fucking allergic reaction.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:52.242 --> 0:12:52.697]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:55.364 --> 0:13:10.062]: 
  I kind of wish I could just the only thing I'd want as a pet is a little robot that's smarter than me I want to be around something smarter than me I don't want to be around something that just eats and sleeps all day and I just got a chance it's a burden it is kind of like a retarded kid I would have talked about this

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:04.965 --> 0:13:07.176]: 
  It's a Buddha.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:09.572 --> 0:13:17.723]: 
  I would have thought because Jeff you're like a kind of cynical in like in general like yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't thought it was an allergic thing. I thought it was just it's both. Yeah, it's wonderful

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:13.487 --> 0:13:13.977]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:16.356 --> 0:13:22.499]: 
  It's both. It could have been one or the other, but luckily I'm both. I'm cynical and allergic.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:22.499 --> 0:13:27.443]: 
  So in that regard, you don't really care about having pets or not? No. Yeah, well that's good. I don't really...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:25.688 --> 0:13:32.067]: 
  No. I don't really feel lonely not having an animal sleeping on the floor in front of me. I have to say that...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:26.937 --> 0:13:27.510]: 
  I don't really

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:30.987 --> 0:13:39.694]: 
  I'm just cynical shit, all right. No, he's just cynical. He's cynical. Oh, he's better. Oh, I get it. No, I get it. I don't want to say it. I understand you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:34.176 --> 0:13:47.136]: 
  He's critical. Oh, he's better. No, I get it. No, I get it. I don't want to say I'm not an animal hater. It's like if I see some of these dogs happily run up to me, I'll pet him and be like, ah, hey, boy, and you know, whatever.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:47.136 --> 0:13:55.962]: 
  No, I'm not saying you're like an asshole. All I was saying was like, I just don't have any need for, I just don't have any need. You don't seem like a guy who really cares about a lot of things, like in general.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:48.705 --> 0:13:52.941]: 
  A lot of what I was saying was like, I just don't have any need for, I just don't have any need.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:55.827 --> 0:13:57.936]: 
  Yeah, I gotta keep going. What I said!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:57.379 --> 0:14:03.134]: 
  What's that? I don't put the cynical shit. I'm not taking my s- You seem like you don't care about the human being. No, no, I'm serious. No, he does.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:00.585 --> 0:14:05.850]: 
  I'm curious how others perceive me

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:04.382 --> 0:14:42.840]: 
  Others perceive me. No like what I perceive you as is like you open this can of worms go out Not a bad kind of worms. Yeah, Jeff. Jeff's like really cool. Well, like why would it ever be bad kind of worms? Keep going. I'm a piece of shit. No, you're not. I just think I just think like you have the stick that you're a little bit like cynical But like I don't think that's a bad thing at all With like angry guy I'm just a realist style. Yeah realist and like Jeff Jeff they say if you if you scratch if you scratch a Disappointed idealist you'll find a cynic. That's what they say. Do they say that? You're just a disappointed idealist Jeff

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:07.960 --> 0:14:08.213]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:10.002 --> 0:14:11.993]: 
  It's a lot of bad kind of worms.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:10.947 --> 0:14:11.504]: 
  That kind of works.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:11.993 --> 0:14:12.584]: 
  Well

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:12.584 --> 0:14:12.617]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:17.224 --> 0:14:20.751]: 
  Keep going, I'm a piece of shit. Okay, no you're not. I just think.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:25.139 --> 0:14:26.624]: 
  I'm a real umber. The worst cynical is sitting on the table.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:27.906 --> 0:14:30.319]: 
  I'm a realist. I'm just a realist style.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:38.267 --> 0:14:38.942]: 
  That's what they say to you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:38.942 --> 0:14:40.714]: 
  Did they say that? That's a rule.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:42.840 --> 0:14:45.794]: 
  You have to like, like it's a lottery card to scratch off the circle.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:44.224 --> 0:15:00.947]: 
  Wait for my time on Twitter, Zach. I'm not with the point, my point is, I guarantee that I can find that on Twitter, care of George Carlin. So fuck me! George Carlin was the same, like in the way that Jeff is, the same way that George Carlin was. They say things how they are.

  That's all of the like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:08.862 --> 0:15:41.852]: 
  I was trying to find a word for it. What I don't get about these dog guys, or cat guys, they buy an animal, and they're like, it's gonna die way before they will. That's what I don't get. It's like, you get temporary happiness and attachment just to be super fucking bummed out and sad later. And then you get it all. And then you get it all in rats because they're really smart and you grow attached to them. They die in a year. Right around the time that you're, you're such a real like them. They die. Yeah, they fucking shrimp up and die through black. People like cats, cause they, what? What's the last time they've met? 15, 15 years. Yeah, maybe 20 if you're lucky.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:44.950 --> 0:23:50.670]: 
  They use all the parts of the pig and they grind it together and then they mix it with filler.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:50.384 --> 0:23:52.139]: 
  Like corn meal or filler, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:51.683 --> 0:23:56.982]: 
  They put it into a block and up here in the northeast they slice it and they fry it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:56.982 --> 0:24:08.693]: 
  It's like this horrendous gray color, but once it's fried, it's not bad. It looks normal and it tastes alright, but you just gotta get over thinking about what it is. Yeah, that's what I'm about to ask.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:06.989 --> 0:24:11.984]: 
  about what it is. Yeah, never ask me. People bitch about hot dogs, but then they're scrapplin'.

  Yeah. I mean, full use of his death. And anytime I go to a diner with somebody I've never, he's never had it before, I always order it. I just want to watch them cringe in front of me. But the taste is OK. It's always worth it. Yeah, it tastes good.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:36.503 --> 0:25:02.744]: 
  It's always I think I think I have no problem with like with with psychology or fear I leave somebody says this is like a cow eyeball be like I'll try it out But it tastes gross it tastes gross a lot of people like like like muscles like clam muscles like muscles are delicious But a lot of people don't like them because they sound gross, but it's fucking tasty You have to feed somebody something first. Yeah, and then tell them what it is later. Yeah What about one of those been only believe it when you get a muscle? Yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:47.944 --> 0:24:48.906]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:33.186 --> 0:25:39.818]: 
  Has anybody ever snuck blue cheese into something that you ate that you thought was phenomenal? Maybe as a kid.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:05.637 --> 0:26:10.058]:

  No, no, no, no, dick cheese. Oh, no, you're confusing with dick cheese. We're talking about dick cheese. It's a French I went to a Mexican restaurant in San Diego and It was one of those places where it's kind of like a poor man's Chipotle where you go up and you pick the meat You want in and so forth and so on. Yeah, and then one of them was cow tongue Oh, and they were really serious about it So when I got up to the counter, they prepare everything right in front of you and they pulled this big-ass Cow tongue out put it on the table like was a tongue like they actually chopped it like this Oh my god, really? Yeah, and it was still connected to the the back of the back of the throat And when I got it I looked inside the taco and I could still see the taste buds in the cows tongue Oh my god, really? It was such an odd pattern little chunks They like they chopped it up so perfectly where every little cow tongue part was in a perfect little cube and at the top of every Little cube it was just dotted with this geometrical pattern of like holy fuck I was I will say that it was absolutely delicious really, but you taste their taste buds I well I tried everything they had like some bullshit pork and then they had the cow tongue But they also had this other one called a cow head which I know is was it the full head just yeah Just in a little burger But I knew that I was like a delicacy like what when you have like when you do like cookouts in Mexico and South America like you Do the underground roasts where you bury and then like the head is where all the best parts are and I guess Essentially what they do is like after the roasting process they do all the skin and the shit on the face They pull it all off and they chop that all up and it was fucking horrible I couldn't stomach it. It was just like this mix of shit that I did that sounds fucking But at the same time I've had beef cheek and it was one of the best meals I was at the cheek of a cow look quite literally yes They go and it was like pot roast which is so nice at the left one. I don't fucking don't know I mean like top and bottom. Oh, you mean the butt cheek or the face cheek like I don't know what what is it? That's a good point. Yeah, you don't know either

  Hey, you don't know?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:48.589 --> 0:29:58.512]: 
  I've seen some cooking shows where they actually take the cow head Yeah And they like, they slice it, they slice I don't know what they do, but they slice the meat off it They, uh I mean, you know It's a little disturbing

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:51.424 --> 0:29:51.711]: 
 也

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:56.976 --> 0:30:26.845]: 
  I mean, you know, it's a little disturbing. Well, there's still muscle there. So it's gonna taste like the rest of the muscle I mean, I assume would you eat a cow head or something like that? Where the emotion is or something like I mean, we're just we're just as happy to eat a piece of meat Cut out of a cow's rib cage, but then when it comes to their face, we're like, oh I'm thinking it's because oh, that's what that's like. I could eat a huge torso with no problem But it's not gonna see human head human. I could freak down human. It's supposed to taste like pork You know, it was the shows what you actually

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:03.237 --> 0:30:03.490]:

  I could eat a human's...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:23.470 --> 0:30:43.095]: 
  It's supposed to taste like pork you know as the shows that actually take the cow they peel all the meat off the face Yes, and then they roll it like into a thing and then they slice it down It's not it's yeah, it's like it's a combination of like skin muscle and fat But they slice it down like it's like a sandwich meat or something. Yeah, it's

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:33.612 --> 0:30:34.742]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:50.504 --> 0:31:26.464]: 
  You guys find it really weird that we still like, we're this far advanced that we still kill animals like that. You have to eat other animals? No, but they're actually growing. That's not even, I was gonna say, it's not even like a vegetarian thing. I just think it's weird that we're these really advanced things that can go to like space. And we still have to like make other animals and fucking eat them. We still push our animals and we're gonna win them. You think we'd invent a way to like not have to eat or eat something like, cause we're gonna have to paste or something. I think it's weird. No, but Zach, they're actually. Fuck, this is coming from a guy by the way who fucking loves meat. There's a big industry starting right now. I think it would be weird if I was like, hey Zach, you wanna go to lunch and you were like, no, I got my paste tube. Yeah. And you squeeze it in your mouth. I just had a bunch of fucking paste. Thank you though.

Yeah I thought that I think a vegan food if they didn't saturate it with salt because they're so lacking in flavor I would kill a big as we're fucking yellow. Yeah, there's skeletons were showing yellow. They're fucking great They're great translucent. You're fucking aliens. They're like these disgusting baby monsters. You're like, I'm so healthy.

I would eat a vegetarian diet all day You're the best meals I've ever had It has to be vegan are a whole But Jeff does you know there's a type of vegan who won't eat anything unless it's fallen to the ground naturally Like if a banana falls to the ground, that's they'll only eat that

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:26.940 --> 0:37:13.988]: 
  No, I can't remember what it was called, but I saw a username that really impressed me on that website. What was it? She was last. It was called... Like, this is racist, but this is me. I was just doing out of curiosity, but the username that really impressed me was called Lynch Jamal. But if you say it really fast, it's Lynch Jamal. And I thought that it was just a very clever username. Wow, I think you just applied that and gave him credit for that. You just gave an extreme racist credit for being really creatively racist. No, I'm giving... You're inventing a new way to hate black people. No, no, no, because there's like three levels to that pun that I thought was pretty clever, but I don't agree with what he's doing. I'm not racist at all. I'm just saying that that was a pretty... Why were you on a website with that guy as a username? Because it's funny. I just think it's fascinating to see the insight of what racists think.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:45.250 --> 0:36:46.701]:

It's like I hate niggers.org I wasn't gonna say the name cuz I didn't want to I like that's not the name But I wasn't gonna say a name because I didn't want to give those pieces of shit credit

  They hate people. The whole thing isn't actually just hate. It's they have all these subsections like movies, home cooking, like furnishing. And then it's like the top, the top part is like nigger hating, sci-fi movies. You go into the section, like they're discussing a movie like Inception. And it's like, it seems like a normal conversation, a relatively normal conversation. Then you look at the user names and it's like Obama banana eater and like, the icon is Obama eating a banana. And it's like all like that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:37.452 --> 0:38:55.542]: 
  Yeah, he's like, I wasn't a fan of Exceptio, the directing was really poor. Yeah. Why are you on here, dude? But, like, our point here is like, it's the absurdity of these sites. Yeah, it's absurd.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:15.915 --> 0:42:20.219]: 
  How black? Do you like them like they're purple black or like light light brown black?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:22.564 --> 0:42:24.184]: 
  No, no, that's not how it is at all, no?

  The only thing I hate is when I get a little too chummy with one and then he throws out like the fancy black eye handshake. Every region has like 23 special black eye handshakes and then like the first move is like your signal to like what handshake it is but I don't know. It's like the fastest way to make a white guy feel stupid is to throw out these handshakes at him. And he's like doing all his moves and I'm like struggling to keep up.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:36.992 --> 0:42:37.144]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42 --> 0:42:43.253]: 
  Like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:43.118 --> 0:42:45.244]: 
  Like, he's like, the slap, slap, slap.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:01.917 --> 0:43:04.853]: 
  You was like high five and he's like, oh, fucking white crag. You know.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:03.925 --> 0:43:06.777]: 
  I'm just saying and I apologize after I'm like I'm sorry

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:06.540 --> 0:43:09.494]: 
  I'm so sorry I'm white, forgive me. I didn't realize.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:09.494 --> 0:43:11.299]: 
  I'm so sorry for being a white guy.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:10.759 --> 0:43:18.994]: 
  Your biggest mistake is holding your hand away from your face. You have to hold your hand at a 45 degree angle with all your fingers pointing...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:18.994 --> 0:43:22.437]: 
  force him into a white guy handshake.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:20.665 --> 0:43:21.104]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:22.437 --> 0:43:35.684]: 
  I see but if you actually if you do it right if you lock the right way You're like this suits the overwhelming research to turn lighter if you if you open up a hand Slap somebody in the face and bad things are gonna happen. You have to cut it. What if he admits?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:24.023 --> 0:43:24.310]: 
  If you would.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:29.153 --> 0:43:30.402]: 
  Do you open up a handshake?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:34.722 --> 0:43:37.169]: 
  What if he init- So what if he initiates it?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:36.510 --> 0:43:39.194]: 
  Somebody needs to animate this because it's really difficult.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:39.278 --> 0:43:51.698]: 
  So if a black guy initiates a handshake where he, I don't know, maybe I could force a white guy handshake on him. He's like, you can't deviate, you just have to push your hand out really hard. Straight, straight. At a 45 degree angle.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:45.809 --> 0:43:46.500]: 
  What, yeah, what

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:46.500 --> 0:43:48.239]: 
  He's just like, hello, sir.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:50.280 --> 0:43:55.832]: 
  Straight straight all your fingers pointed forward from your chest out with a big white light face

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:55.292 --> 0:43:59.916]: 
  You have to overpower him with your whiteness. What if like just before they get in there with their handshake?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:57.807 --> 0:44:03.190]: 
  What if like just before they get in there with their handshake you get in there with your 90 degrees straight ahead fucking robotic handshake

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:02.869 --> 0:44:07.358]: 
  I'm gonna have to remember this. This is a good this is a good

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:05.552 --> 0:44:24.014]: 
  Jeff, have you seen? Do you think it's a good idea to overpower a black guy with your whiteness? I think that's been a couple times, you know, been done a couple of times before. Have you seen? Zack. Zack, have you seen the video of Obama? He was a hero, Hitler. I think it was every... He didn't hate the blacks, he hated the Jews, alright. Have you ever heard of the phenomenon called cook-olding?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:12.184 --> 0:44:14.040]: 
  Listen, Zach.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:17.685 --> 0:44:18.563]: 
  I think it was...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:24.014 --> 0:44:25.566]: 
  Yes. Cuckolding?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:25.279 --> 0:44:38.745]: 
  What do you think the psychology behind that is? That was a phenomenon. Can someone explain this to me? I don't know if this is a question. Cupholding is when a white guy wants his wife to fuck a huge black dude. That's not... You say, how's nothing to do with a black guy? You don't think boys are... Your spread lies on this topic!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:26.933 --> 0:44:28.047]: 
  That was a phenomenal game.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:28.924 --> 0:44:29.346]: 
  Thanks.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:33.666 --> 0:44:42.104]: 
  That's not... There's nothing to do with the black guy. That's not... You don't think... Your spread lies, and it's not accurate. That is not accurate. That is not exactly... That is not... Chuck, you could use... You could use...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:34.949 --> 0:44:35.505]: 
  with the black

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:40.855 --> 0:44:45.377]: 
  Jeff, you, can you, can you enlighten us? Why is it always a big, it doesn't even have to be sexual really.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:44.280 --> 0:44:52.954]: 
  It's basically a married guy who's sort of letting, his wife is all fucking another guy and he's just letting it happen.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:52.785 --> 0:45:10.572]: 
  Yeah, and he kind of gets off to a pretty he Why'd you add a black guy to that? What the hell? It really doesn't do with a black guy I thought it was always the dude. I thought it was a black guy Yeah, because you spent too much time on porno sites It just, it just is Well, that may be true. That's not where I got my information from I'm not sure if he wants it to happen, but it's a spot in this white guy Did you throw it in yourself?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:54.675 --> 0:44:58.455]: 
  Why did you add a black guy into that? What the hell really does nothing to do with a black guy?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:59.080 --> 0:44:59.822]: 
  I thought of the block.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:00.852 --> 0:45:01.442]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:02.522 --> 0:45:04.159]: 
  It's just this. I do spend...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:07.129 --> 0:45:09.458]: 
  I'm not sure if he wants it to happen, but it's a spineless one.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:10.690 --> 0:45:14.402]: 
  Well, listen. You call him a cuckold if he's married and his wife's all fucking over. Wait, he is a cuckold.

  You could just change the subject.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:08.511 --> 0:49:20.001]: 
  Here's a simple and really good point because I felt I felt guilty because I under tipped the delivery guy about two weeks ago It was like um, I the total for the bill was I thought it was $30. So I gave him 36 That's a good tip, but it was 33 40. Oh, I was there for that $34. I gave it I still gave him 36 so you had like a $2 tip and I felt horrible Yeah, I remember that you were saying like I shouldn't feel bad because he's just the driver Well, that's a thing driver to right? I think you have a bit of black blood in you when you what's that? Like when you when you deliver pizza, it's not like tipping 15% for a waitress or a waiter Which is what usually do I you 15 or 15 comes back consistently when I delivered pizza I got they would just give me two bucks. Is that fair do you think two three dollars? And that was completely acceptable for delivery driver. See I I do 20% on on whatever I go to restaurants or whatever they're not coming back to your table and refilling your water Yeah, coming back and attending to all they're coming here once I I did something stupid Undertip that guy and I felt so I was wrecked with guilt you can ask now I was a wrecked with guilt. Yeah, I was eating really sad We're sitting down watching and Zach was just kind of looking at the ground for the rest of the and then what did you do? To compensate it makes no sense. It's completely fucking stupid. I felt so horrible, but I were just a different guy Thanks for bring a punchline now. Is that it? I haven't heard the punchline though. No, was it? Yeah No, no say it again. We cut my bit out I felt so horrible about under tipping it that the one guy that I overtook the different I completely different guy for a different Restaurant and my overtip you mean I it was a $15 thing and I gave him $25 cuz I felt so horrible I know I know I felt that guilt written And it was a Chinese dude, and I'm not joking. He was like, oh, thank you. Thank you And now every that's why that was not really that's exactly how he said it He literally bowed to me like put his hands together. Oh, oh It is a triangle hat fall off Yes No sense cuz like the dude I under tip is just pissed off of me and I do that over tip Like they're gonna talk to each other But now every time I order food from the Chinese place that dude always comes and super stoked every time he comes Cuz you think some good over tip them again. Zack whenever we order food

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:23.007 --> 0:47:23.749]:

And we used to go about like five times each summer for years. And we never once caught a fish between us. But like, I was so bad at it that once I pissed my pants. And my dad was so disappointed that we didn't catch a fish and that I pissed my pants. You pissed your pants because you didn't catch a fish in the river? What did you piss your pants for? I just pissed my pants.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:49.489 --> 0:50:50.114]:

It's like to say, I don't know what it is about these stories you got. You and Chris are like, there's one time I was running down the road and there was a bug and I stepped on it and then somebody spit my eye.

You pissing your pants has nothing to do with this! William Andrew Stamper will you let me finish? I'll let you finish! Look, I pissed my pants and my dad was already disappointed that I could never catch a fish and then he got even more disappointed that I pissed my pants and we just hauled it a day Why did you piss your pants? and we never went fishing again That's the end of your story! You already finished it! That was your story to begin with! My story was that he didn't know You know, your dad caught disappointment that day The whole point is you have to summarize why you pissed your pants Oh, like, okay, I'll give you the context He was like this man could be a doctor someday He's my son and ever since then he just let me do what I want because he realized that I was just one of the rest If I was born in the medieval times I would have died at the age of four He knows that now He knows that I'm not a strong one Oh my god, dude, Nile, if you were a hit man you would be like, alright, so I went up to the top and fell down and I had the guy in my sight and then I put my gun down and I ate a chocolate bar and then I went back and it's like, what does this chocolate bar have to do with you killing somebody? Those are Irish stories! Okay, well, stop it! Irish stories! I didn't catch a fish so you don't have that part of the story so I just supplemented it with pissing my pants That's instead of catching me That's Irish honesty! He came out with the time I'm trying to tell you here what happened that day when I went fishing

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:15.936 --> 0:56:16.206]: 
  Thank you for watching.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:16.847 --> 0:57:26.524]: 
  I'll start. Sure. I had three grandfathers. One died before I was born. One was a step-grandfather. He's cool. He's still alive. He'll be dead soon. Oh, is he? I don't know. Like fucking 900. And then uh... Because you're up in all the people. My grandfather's like 88. Last time I saw my other grandpa, he was in a wheelchair smoking cigarettes even though he had cancer. I remember when I was growing up, my father was always a pretty good artist. Really? And he drew a picture of my grandpa. And half of my grandpa's face in the picture was melted. Why? And I thought my dad was a bad artist. And it turns out that my grandpa was in a submarine and a steam pipe blew up in his face and melted half of his... So my dad's drawing was completely... It's just accurate. It looked like... Damn. Oh man, that's fucking sad. That's pretty much all I know about my grandpa. But you had a half-melted face. You had a half-melted face. World War II must have been right. I don't fucking know. What about your other grandpa? CNN.com? World War II is... You look spaced up. I don't know what I hear from you. Hey, uh, Zach, what about your grandpa? Yeah, tell me about your grandpa. Well, listen to me about my grandpa. Before I say anything...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:17.691 --> 0:56:18.147]: 
  Sure.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:42.717 --> 0:56:43.240]: 
  Really.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:50.192 --> 0:56:50.800]: 
  Why?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:04.485 --> 0:57:05.076]: 
  Oh man

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:08.282 --> 0:57:09.497]: 
  D bags doen niet mevrouw te rib nominees in zsa.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:09.497 --> 0:57:10.307]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:27.435 --> 0:58:41.989]: 
  Being a mom is one of the hardest jobs out there, and you wouldn't want to make that any more difficult, right? So why use a paper towel that just isn't up to the challenge? Try rodeo brand paper towels with patented lasso pockets that wrangle up the biggest of messes with ease, leaving you with more time for the kids, or whatever the fuck you want to do. Maybe you can start a workout plan and actually stick to it this time, your fat, greasy bee, yeah, that's rodeo brand paper towels for messes as big as Texas. Now back to the show. Yeah, my grandfather, I have two, but one passed away, gosh rest his soul, you know what I mean? But the other one is alive. He's 88 now, he's still fucking alive, and he was rodeo, it was kind of like a really rough military kind of, not military, but you know, kind of a rodeo, it was Ruff-Stern, 50s, 60s kind of dads, but all he does now is like, cause he's 88, he was born in 1926, that's so fucking long ago, but I think now all he does now is like sit on, you know, watch Leave It To Beaver and Mash, and shit his pants, he still drinks like Scott, he just sits there and watches it. Oh yeah, he's totally done. He doesn't give a fuck dude, he was, I can't believe he's coherent. He's a veteran? Yeah, World War II of Korea. What did he do exactly in World War II? He flew, he flew planes and fucking bomb the gooks.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:25.013 --> 0:58:26.464]: 
  Thanks dude. Thank you old man.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:43.896 --> 0:59:22.337]: 
  Which is what he'd say to me. Yeah, you're just paraphrasing here. Yeah, paraphrasing what my grandfather would say. He called, this is a true story. I don't know if I can tell you can believe it, but this shows his age and his time. He looked on Martin Luther King Day. He looked at me and he said, yeah, it's Martin Luther Nigger Day. It laughed really hard. And I was like, damn, dude. And my grandpa was like, don't say that, Ed. And he was like, it's funny. And she was like trying to salvage you. But I'm like, oh, you know, he's just... Your grandpa was just you in the future. Yeah, it's me right now. But she was trying to salvage you. And be like, no, he doesn't think that way. It's funny. It's, you know, he's still, he's still the same as you, right? He has no filter. He doesn't give a shit. He sits there all day, doesn't care. I would either lose.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:46.984 --> 0:58:47.305]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:07.386 --> 0:59:07.403]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:21.494 --> 0:59:56.695]:

He gave me the samurai swords really have a yeah He brought back a ton of stuff from the war actually he brought back that he brought back some of those um What do you call one of those? Those knives Japanese people stab themselves in the stomach. Yeah, like you brought back some of them hand-carved though knives those two of those

  All the ritual ceremony knives.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:58.855 --> 1:00:48.434]: 
  You know, for being a doctor, I think him and his friends were kinda a little fucked up. I don't know. What do you mean? I keep hearing these stories about, like my grandfather and his other friend, he'd call, I think all I, I don't know if it was his first or last name, I just knew him as Morris and he'd uh, this guy was like, you know, I think as he died when he was 90, but he was the craziest fucking old man I've ever known. He was a surgeon, he used to be a surgeon, and he would, I'd hear all these stories about shit, like my grandfather had a goldfish and then his friend Morris came over and he ate, he ate my grandfather's goldfish. For no reason, just cause he thought it'd be funny. He pulled out the- That was pretty funny though. I don't know, I don't know where this story goes, but yeah, then there's this- Yeah, he shouldn't have been a surgeon. There's this story, there's this story that's in my family, this guy, Morris, he's long dead, he's long dead, but there was a story that he uh, he came back from the war with a skeleton. I thought you were gonna say he came back?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:03.833 --> 1:00:04.305]: 
  What do you mean?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:29.297 --> 1:00:30.344]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:47.708 --> 1:00:49.294]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:58.120 --> 1:01:02.457]:

  Here's the thing with my grandfather

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:28.529 --> 1:01:30.807]: 
  I have infinite patience for old people.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:30.807 --> 1:01:43.615]: 
  As I get older, I'm starting to understand this more and more that he just wants to be left in peace to do something, not fucking be bothered. To slowly rot. He wants to tell his racist jokes and do his crossword puzzle and just be left alone.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:37.439 --> 1:01:38.755]: 
  Fucking be bothered.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:43.379 --> 1:01:47.783]: 
  It fit, so I think my grandpa there's more Luther King joke, it's not really a joke, it was more just like a...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:47.867 --> 1:01:52.812]: 
  Oh, no, my grandfather would drop the N-word jokes all the time.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:52.542 --> 1:01:56.305]: 
  Oh, no, you can't you can't leave me in the cold with the animals. He was...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:55.259 --> 1:02:02.346]: 
  He was every every dinner every I look at every even Christmas dinner. He'd be telling them at the Christmas day

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:01.604 --> 1:02:06.936]: 
  What's the best what he told you? So, by best I mean one that you were like damn I can't believe you said that a dinner time

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:03.190 --> 1:02:04.557]: 
  inspired about me, I got in touch with him. So, why would we- Say my best advice to you all is to miss prominently the guest because Owen when heaud starts the selv intensifies. How you're so strong to war Hopefully you guys give it our highest self-esteem and power. I guess that's gonna you people here with this episode. It's gonna be you and I but right now it's gonna be chunk maker get it- Emhmm Why didn't you JEZ

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:04.557 --> 1:02:04.607]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:06.936 --> 1:02:21.854]: 
  He'd crack himself and he'd always tell these jokes and then let out a huge laugh at the end like he just couldn't wait I don't think he was an inherent racist. Yeah, I know he's like the jokes I know he had some black friends. Yeah, I guess he just liked the jokes. He just he just didn't care

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:15.947 --> 1:02:17.432]: 
  He's like the jokes he's...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:21.904 --> 1:02:56.700]: 
  I grew up in the Midwest, people like a lot of adults there still say colored, like a lot of adults. Yeah, colored. Like my uncle, my dad said that, I was like, dad. It's 20 whatever the year was. What's not what's saying colored? It's like like he's 50. No, there's really nothing wrong with saying colored. It's weird, it's weird. It's like the equivalent of saying you're oriental friend. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a real question though, because like, is the offense in saying that they're the ones who's colored and white is also a color, so saying that they're colored. Well, the thing is people are people, you shouldn't have to sit and point. It just feels weird. It reminds people of an age of segregation.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:26.629 --> 1:02:26.663]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:33.379 --> 1:02:36.383]: 
  No, but there's really not... But what are we saying? Hawaii is just weird shit.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:36.383 --> 1:02:37.935]: 
  Cê já entendeu, tá?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:37.935 --> 1:02:38.256]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:40.551 --> 1:02:41.496]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:48.229]: 
  Well the thing is

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:56.700 --> 1:03:04.851]: 
  I don't even know, I don't know. This whole language thing is just weird to me. Everybody keeps, every generation they come up with a new euphemism. A new word.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:04.480 --> 1:04:00.572]: 
  Or they like they change they take the good words to make a bad they take the bad words to make them good It's always weird. It's always like I don't know I think that's weird like like previous slurs are now good to say but previous ones that were okay to say now example The word faggot's example that's changing it's there was never like everyone says the word faggot now faggot does not mean gay Not me has a man gay. Yeah, but I know men gay for like five months in the 1970s my point is like people are now trying to take the word faggot back It's like they were gay gave it like like happy and like then I'm in homosexual It's it's going through all these different changes if I call you a fag and I'm not calling you a gay guy Do you think soon like another regular word will turn into like to mean gay like just saying like a fucking Even even the word queer before the word queer bit fag which meant gay which means homosexual That word used to be like that was a descriptive or like the word gay it used to be like your peculiar I think like that's a queer observation or whatever

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:23.684 --> 1:03:25.439]: 
  It hasn't been gay, but...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:25.439 --> 1:03:25.709]: 
  No!

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:00.572 --> 1:04:28.500]: 
  There's, when I'm talking about like words that are acceptable and all of a sudden they slowly become unacceptable and they come up with a new software word to take its place like like the most recent one is Calling straight guys Sys guys. Oh, yeah, you can't say straight. Yeah straight is now an offensive word. Oh, he's straight that that implies You know, I bet that's good. Yeah, so he's cis like what is cis is just in another 20 years cis is gonna be offensive

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:14.258 --> 1:04:14.680]: 
  Oh, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:19.523 --> 1:04:21.126]: 
  My bed's good. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:26.745 --> 1:05:11.498]: 
  No matter what title you give the group, somebody's gonna hate that group and be like, oh those fucking blacks, you can say that without heavy a word. Do you know what that is? Do you know what this is about to be in people? Jesus Christ. But do you know what like cis makes it? Do you know what cis actually means? Straight guy. No, no, no, cis. No, it means you're the sexual orientation that you were born with. No, no, no, but in science, if there's fats, right, there's trans fats and then there's cis fats and cis is the opposite of trans and that's why they're saying cis. They're just joking? No, no, I'm dead. You just mean the original word. Yeah, no, I'm deadly serious. It's the opposite of trans. So cis is like, they're saying, oh so there's trans fats, there's trans people. So there's cis fats and cis people, that's how they do it. Straight guy.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:36.314 --> 1:04:37.765]: 
  Do you know what else? It's actually...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:38.406 --> 1:04:38.777]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:39.486 --> 1:04:41.427]: 
  But do you know what like it's just makes it simple?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:43.350 --> 1:04:43.367]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:43.367 --> 1:04:45.375]: 
  No, no, no, sis, like...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:57.509 --> 1:05:01.508]: 
  No, no, I'm dead. You just mean that's the original word.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:10.469 --> 1:05:13.945]: 
  Straight person isn't the opposite of a trans exactly

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:13.067 --> 1:05:20.054]: 
  Exactly, exactly. That's why it makes no sense, but they're trying to make it they're trying to give logic into it and it's a

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:19.649 --> 1:05:24.019]: 
  And they even use sys as an insult. Yeah, you fucking sys. Oh, check your privilege.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:21.859 --> 1:05:45.957]: 
  Yeah, you fucking sys. Oh, check your privilege. I know that check your privilege thing has become a meme now, but like, people say that unironically. People say check your privilege before you insult someone. Yeah, they're just bad. Like, people tell us to check our privilege. Whatever white you got headed, everything you fucking white. You fucking... Yeah, oh, as if our life is fucking easy, cause we're white. No way. The lot of us are fucking miserable, you serious? Oh, I'm sorry. I-I star. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:29.588 --> 1:05:32.035]:

  Black people like them all. Because the fact that no one else is a feminist, I'm the geek.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:11.961 --> 1:06:40.682]: 
  But when you like, like, I'm a feminist and you, it's like you're almost saying other people It's a new buzzword, yeah, I'm better But there's some, it's a trend It's a weird feeling that they, they, they have this moral high ground There were people like, somehow other people aren't for equal rights for everybody, but they are I don't even like bringing it up, fucking, because I, you know, there's enough of this bullshit going around on the internet But it's, these people, there's such a fucking lack of common sense going on on the internet It's mind blowing, like Jeff I don't even know, uh Jeff, do you, do you think?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:10.332 --> 1:07:10.517]: 
  Jeff

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:11.766 --> 1:07:35.661]:

There's these white girls who are like I have a presence like well How are you a press a guy? Well? I looked at my ass. It's like fuck They get off on it. They it's almost like a fetish.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:14.753 --> 1:07:15.074]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:28.658 --> 1:07:32.050]: 
  is like fuck they're all they're off on it

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:33.754 --> 1:07:43.272]: 
  They don't want to have any inner strength. They don't want to be able to solve problems on their own. They want to blame others. They want to feel bad for them.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:43.339 --> 1:07:48.402]: 
  Stanford, do you think it's almost like a fetish or it's something that like they really just want like desire kind of

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:47.659 --> 1:08:11.436]: 
  No, no. The problem is human beings, human beings have evolved over fucking tens of thousands of years They need a certain human beings need a certain amount of shit to do shit and difficulty and challenges in their life to Grow up mentally healthy. You have these spoiled fucking brats who've grown up with no challenge Yeah, nothing to do

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:00.214 --> 1:08:00.518]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:11.436 --> 1:08:16.801]: 
  It fucks them up. And if there's no legitimate problems, people create problems for themselves.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:16.094 --> 1:08:23.029]: 
  Yeah, they start their their mentality starts getting all fucking twisted like oh my god. I I have everything too good. I

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:23.029 --> 1:09:29.652]: 
  That's it! That's what I've been trying to say. It's everything. It's like they don't have any real oppression So they try to build it for themselves. What is like that in your head? Why is that like a human thing? It's like it's like people it's like it's intrinsic in the human brain and like people just need to feel oppressed like why what is that? What were the yeah, you know, I don't get it. Human beings are human beings. They need to feel oppressed or they need to have somebody to point the finger at. Humans evolved to problem-solve. When we stopped like having to run from other animals and like weather and stuff And to stop having to starve. We just said oh fuck That's so good. We start to look at our problems and we start to point out other people's problems. For a time for like a hundred years or so like around the 17th and 1800s We started to actually like you know fix real problems like in hundreds we started to do a thing We need food and water. We gave women the right to vote. Great. We helped other people. We freed we stopped slavery. We did segregation That's great, but now we're gonna put what it's like. I don't think it's too good. I don't think it's too fucking good. It is too good. That's why I'm saying we need another 9-11. I We need a nuclear strike to happen. We do all this shake you stamper

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:38.790 --> 1:08:39.819]: 
  But what were the- Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:45.692 --> 1:08:45.895]: 
  Please.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:55.497 --> 1:08:56.712]: 
  That sucks over there.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:21.754 --> 1:09:23.340]: 
  I would say

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:28.604 --> 1:09:34.714]: 
  This is why- As fucked up as that is to say, it would reset a bunch of people's brains.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:34.647 --> 1:10:22.943]: 
  When 9-11 was going on, everybody was focused on that. On anthrax and shit. Yeah, everything else. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, anthrax. I honestly want to take one of these white, these fat little white guys with glasses and put them in Iraq and be like, dude, complain. Complain to these fucking people. We would not think about. Oh, that would be. We need a huge earthquake to put people's morals back into order. Like, what? Do you think if I put you in Iraq, would you give a shit about Game of the Game? Or would you worry about the guy screaming, I'll act upon the distance. We're in to read and draw these fucking kids. Who gives a shit? Did you guys hear Jennifer Lawrence's titties on the internet going to the fucking desert? Run from tigers, dude. The weird thing about that is it's just titties. I didn't give a fuck because it was Jennifer Lawrence. Like, it's literally just a naked body. You just look porn. It looks exactly the same. You're a scab.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:41.987 --> 1:09:42.224]: 
  And...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:42.899 --> 1:09:43.944]: 
 我太噁心了

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:43.944 --> 1:09:44.332]: 
  That was a great day.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:51.993 --> 1:09:53.209]: 
  Hayt Fr fever

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:22.943 --> 1:10:24.411]: 
  That brain is fucked tonight. Jeff!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:24.057 --> 1:10:31.667]: 
  Jeff, do you think that if we lived in a complete utopia, like a complete, beautiful, like humans would just find a way? Human beings are not meant to live.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:29.507 --> 1:10:46.079]: 
  Find a way things are not my way. It's it's like it's like the fucking matrix when they're talking about Just they're like yeah, we made a perfect world and it fucking fell apart We need to give you guys you need to give humans like a struggle to keep you mentally healthy. That is it That is the truth. I know

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:31.667 --> 1:10:32.747]: 
  It's like that.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:44.340 --> 1:11:06.177]: 
  That is it. That is the truth. Humans are inherently greedy. We need to find... Humans will never be world peace ever. Ever. Ever. Because if everyone decides to be peaceful, there's one guy who will want to take advantage of that. Yeah, there's one ass who's like, Fuck you guys, it's like, Oh, he's peaceful. I can actually just like, you serp this throne now or whatever.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:55.934 --> 1:10:56.980]: 
  Jaever!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:56.440 --> 1:10:56.946]: 
  Never!

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:00.473 --> 1:11:01.232]: 
  e é dos bonessos...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:05.704 --> 1:11:22.866]: 
  People are naturally going to take sides no matter what. They're going to auto-balance out each side one way or another. Like if there's some struggle going on, there's a bunch of people that are neutral and one side is way bigger than the other, I guarantee a bunch of people will join the smaller side just because instinctually that's what they're going to do.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:08.877 --> 1:11:09.299]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:22.579 --> 1:11:35.742]: 
  Yep. I agree. Completely. It seems to be just an inherent thing that we like look for a balance. Like if we're too happy we need to balance it down to being like unhappy or look for a way to be unhappy. I don't know. I think it's an equilibrium kind of thing.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:35.725 --> 1:11:44.939]: 
  This century is just fascinating in that you're starting to see what happens when human brains aren't given what they need. They start to go fucking crazy.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:44.939 --> 1:12:05.492]: 
  Yeah, and a hundred years they're gonna look back at this generation and think we were fucking bar back. It could be worse, I don't know. If we're around in a hundred years to think about shit, we're fucking walking around the ruins of humanity. You don't think we're gonna be around in a hundred years? Do you? Human beings are fucking cockroaches, dude. There's no way we're... We're gonna be around... Like, is this gonna be... Are we gonna be around enough to think about, like, wow?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:49.191 --> 1:11:51.250]: 
  It could be worse, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:58.354 --> 1:11:58.945]: 
  Do you?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:00.869 --> 1:12:01.442]: 
  You know what?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:01.442 --> 1:12:02.303]: 
  We're gonna be around the-

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:05.492 --> 1:12:11.449]: 
  Human Engineuit is the funny thing about human ingenuity is once the shit starts to hit the wall, we'll figure it out.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:11.449 --> 1:12:31.193]: 
  No we will, but I like imagine if all our destruction happens. Everyone's worried about Fallout, are you serious? Human beings really? We are so fucking stubborn, there's no way. It's like we're a parasite. Like we do look for ways to evolve all the time. Yeah a lot of us are. The internet is actually a step in evolution because we can communicate with everyone now. It's honestly, it's all just like evolving into the...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:13.491 --> 1:12:14.706]: 
  Old andiva 2 short Looks like a ooze Nah That was nice

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:19.988 --> 1:12:20.579]: 
  It's it we

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:24.426 --> 1:12:25.979]: 
  Yeah, a lot of us are- The internet is-

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:31.193 --> 1:12:36.407]: 
  That's it. Once the billionaires start having to breathe in smog every day, ill things will get fixed.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:36.340 --> 1:12:41.436]: 
  Yeah, yep once they don't have their fucking fucking jets and shit. What if there's a cab at shut up now?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:39.563 --> 1:12:43.056]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:56.100 --> 1:13:04.099]: 
  They do tie themselves. I noticed that earlier. If they were gray, they would be Marty McFly sneakers, self-lacing and all that. Well, it is Velcro.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:57.754 --> 1:12:58.919]: 
  I noticed that earlier.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:01.821 --> 1:13:24.450]:

What oh when you cross the crosswalk it was it wouldn't shut the fuck up I would I stopped and it's like it's like warning an emergency vehicle is approaching warning And really the second it got through the intersection warning a train is approaching warning within another ambulance It just kept talking for five minutes

  I just think women are stupid, unfunny, only good for rape.

  What's wrong with hating a woman just cuz she's a fucking asshole? Why do you why can't I just hate a woman for being an asshole? Do you think people who miss out on it? It doesn't mean you hate all women.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:59.601 --> 1:14:01.609]: 
  Do you think people who must not need to-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:03.921 --> 1:14:22.534]: 
  This is the one thing that liberals did. I have a liberal myself. I'm serious. I'm a liberal myself so I can say this. The one thing liberals did that pissed me off a couple years ago was when anybody ever criticized Obama, it was like, you're a racist. It's like, no, dude, you can hate Obama and not be a racist. People hated Clinton. People hated Carter. You're liberal.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:14:21.724 --> 1:14:24.880]:

  The furthest left is they give- They've gone fucking crazy. The furthest left is they give like pigs equal rights to humans, that kind of thing. It's like we're not that fucking fire gone, but like we want everything to be fair. I've said like the left is- the far left is- that was so far left to go to the far right now.

  What the hell are you guys talking about? Like these guys who are so far politically left. No, no, Zach, seriously. Sorry. Zach has a point here because like he's saying like you're going so far left that you love women so much that you want them to all have equal rights and then you're like... Yeah, women can't like wear this. Yeah, they can't. You're liberal, you're anti-liberal. I'm not anti-liberal. No, I'm not anti-liberal. You know what I am?

  You know Jeff, Jeff, you pull it off. You would stamp her. You do the sideburns going in your face and I like that. No, because I am a man. I'm a boy. I'm a big boy. Whaaaaa. So what's with no- So but the hipsters don't shave for the month. Yeah, but your 19 year old neck feels so growth of neck feels for a month because they would help cancer out. But the thing I was- That's what I was waiting for? Yeah. The thing I don't understand is it's for cancer awareness and everybody knows about cancer, which is what's called a sample. What kind of cancer? Prostate cancer because it's from- It's doing cancer. It's like breast cancer. It's like the opposite of breast cancer. Not the opposite of breast cancer.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:32.562 --> 1:19:36.089]: 
  How does growing your beard out do anything?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:36.004 --> 1:19:43.868]: 
  Because you, you set up a page on movember.com or whatever and you get people to sponsor your fucking you growing KQ live. So you said it's for cancer?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:42.366 --> 1:19:51.158]: 
  You said it's cancer. Yeah, this is a you said say you feel connected like all these people in their cancer Don't you out their beards because they can't well they can't they got

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:45.117 --> 1:19:48.509]: 
  so you can feel connected to all these people in their cancer beds.

  It's like all these

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:50.415 --> 1:19:52.879]: 
  Well they can't because they got chemo, they can't grow hair.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:51.900 --> 1:19:57.047]:

  I'm guessing. I'm just guessing. It's more like taunting. I have no idea what that means. It's like taunting that looks like that. I understand it. I got a lot of knows.
