 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:00.497 --> 0:00:20.275]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense. A world enveloped by a seemingly unending ocean of forests. Buried deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little cabin. And in that cabin...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:20.275 --> 0:00:42.854]:

  I forgot to take your cocaine. Let's get some questions. We can all come as a team. Where do these questions come from, Stamper? I actually don't know where you got these fucking things. I know either. It's fun. Is this from Reddit? This is from reddit.org. Backslashreddit.com. From the show Sleepy Cabin subreddit. It's from the awesome fans of Sleepy Cabin who had amazing, intriguing, introspective questions. I think it's easy to make it. That's a little bit. I give them all a B minus. Stamper, what do you get asked constantly? Oh, what happened to garbage and rubbish? The two foxes, if you don't know. The two foxes. Yeah, if you don't know, just go to my channel and you'll see a couple of videos. So. And.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:46.566 --> 0:00:47.241]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:10.991 --> 0:02:33.233]: 
  I'm on to you Chinese people could be gay. Absolutely. That's insane. You know what they kind of have to if you think about the population of China They have guys and girls absolutely do like five girls and all the China there's like 18 billion I also heard that they're getting tired of like relationships and having to deal with that was Japan

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:17.235 --> 0:02:19.412]: 
  Yeah, there's both guys and girls, right?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:19.412 --> 0:02:19.868]:

  18 billion Chinese people. You're gonna have to find your way to.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:24.441 --> 0:02:26.618]: 
  It also makes sense too because like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:30.398 --> 0:02:34.752]: 
  That was Japan. That was in Japan where none of them wanted to have sex.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:33.942 --> 0:02:50.952]: 
  But yeah, like this is same thing just take it but in China like if you go in tinder There's like five girls and then the rest of them are dudes the rut The one you think Chinese guys get like really stoker. They say like the small time they're the click it It's just a girl looking guy like oh god. Yeah, yeah, they do clear. I say gay and Mandarin. I say homosexual

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:35.865 --> 0:02:36.962]:

You'd reach down for your keys, and you'd just pull up a handful of juice. And Stanford would be standing behind you, snicker. Why is he going to the bank with his costume on? He's like, oh, where's my fucking coat? He's hungry. It's a functional outfit. It's a functional pocket that I stick my keys and my important stuff, like my wallet in. It is. Fucking dirty wrappers. That's where you store it. But that's where Sleepy Cabin came from. It worked out well. Yeah, it was beautiful. It came from Cory's cumb powders.

Asks, which sleepy cabin member gave you the worst first impression? And you know what, we'll do best first impression as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, alright, Kory, you start. My best first impression. Well, I guess it would have to be based on who I was more worried to meet. That would kind of like outweigh the person I really wanted to meet. Well, mistakes are the highest. Don't you mean the best first impression was the person you released? Yes, I think when they say worst impression, they might like you. Not even like an asshole, but just like, ooh, okay. You met somebody and you're like, what the fuck's wrong with that guy? And then you meet him twice, you're like, oh, he's just a weird first experience or whatever. Yeah, okay.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:05:25.527 --> 0:05:25.695]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:17.147 --> 0:07:06.304]: 
  I never had any I know what was everybody that you kind of scared to meet that wasn't you big yeah me yeah Because of my group of like horrible people I thought you had like a bad impression of what I would be like if we ever met I was afraid to meet you Well, you need to say names man. They don't see you pointing. I was afraid to meet stamper I was I was I wasn't really afraid to meet Zach because I was gonna be meeting Zach and riding on a plane to Philly, so I feel like once we met I wouldn't be but I was also really afraid to meet Chris Yeah, um like meeting Chris was probably like the easiest one because after you meet him Okay, I know exactly how he's gonna be really afraid, but I was really afraid to meet me I was really afraid to meet me. I really I was so tell you I was a man. He's I swear I came out and I was like he's the nicest guy ever I came up to make like um yeah like a Innocent schoolgirl like meeting her first hair.

But with Stamper, I met Stamper and we hung out for a little bit and I was kind of nervous but by the end of the day I kind of knew what I was in for. But I would say you were probably... Sounded like your worst and best impressions were kind of like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:25.997 --> 0:07:28.326]: 
  impressions were kind of smashed together.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:27.617 --> 0:07:58.009]: 
  Yeah, I would say my first impression was good. You caught it because it was like we met at the airport and then we started drawing. It was natural. It was my best. Yeah. I don't know. I'd say it was worse. I was a little afraid to be a Sam, but I just didn't really know that well. Same thing with Jeff too. I thought Jeff was Jose, my chamber from New Brunswick. I saw Jeff and I was like, because I talked to Jeff for a little bit before that online, but I never actually saw before. Keep forgetting that people think that faggot's part of sleepy cabin.

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:00.799 --> 0:11:01.508]: 
  He looked at me and he was like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:12.696 --> 0:11:24.441]: 
  And I'm like, fuck you, dude. But yeah, that was another best impression. I would say that my worst impression was probably from Chris. Yeah, it did owes. Because I got a lot of love from him.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:11:16.510 --> 0:11:17.505]: 
  So that was a...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:17.505 --> 0:11:18.855]: 
  Another best question.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:22.450 --> 0:11:35.342]: 
  Yeah, it did owes because I did this dot dot dot video and it got way too overexposed and Tom left it on the front page New grounds for like a year and I was getting so fucking tired of it, but whatever I guess there was it was getting

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:26.922 --> 0:11:27.006]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:35.342 --> 0:11:41.451]: 
  views and stuff but I felt terrible because all these other people were making like legitimate cartoons and shit and then there was this typography.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:41.451 --> 0:11:44.404]: 
  that was just fucking sitting there. Um, anyways, I remember

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:43.645 --> 0:12:00.942]: 
  Anyways, I remember reading the review from Chris. Oh my god. He was like... What was the score? Do you remember what it was? It was like a three or... Oh, was it? I think... I don't know. We can always go back. It was probably a two or something. Yeah, it was like, you know what? This is fine for what it is, but this is like out of control and it shouldn't be getting the attention it deserves.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:47.003 --> 0:11:50.074]: 
  He was like what was the score?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:52.470 --> 0:11:52.960]: 
  We'll see you in the next one.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:53.753 --> 0:11:55.204]: 
  Yeah, it was like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:00.942 --> 0:12:03.507]: 
  deserves or whatever and I think I commented back and it was

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:03.507 --> 0:12:19.943]: 
  Dude, I totally agree, but I was like wow Chris is really harsh But obviously I don't know how I don't know how you gathered so much hatred in the early days I don't know. I mean I try to be as friendly as I could about you I think that even pissed people off Be real like

 SPEAKER_04 [0:12:08.215 --> 0:12:08.772]: 
  I don't know how

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:11.522 --> 0:12:11.607]: 
  I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:13.834 --> 0:12:14.779]: 
  That's what it was.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:15.707 --> 0:12:23.588]: 
  Oh fuck this guy, he's so... It can't be real, like you can't actually be real. Oh yeah, he's a little... There's something lying about it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:19.943 --> 0:12:19.994]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:12:19.994 --> 0:12:20.567]: 
  He's a little...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:20.567 --> 0:12:24.533]: 
  Yes, there's something lying about it. I don't think I ever had a bad experience with you, I can say.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:24.432 --> 0:12:28.161]: 
  No, you reached out to me for the cartoon stuff and I just started voicing.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:27.081 --> 0:12:37.409]: 
  Yeah, what was the first video? It was before Skyrim. It was the Skyrim game. Yeah, that was 2011.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:31.013 --> 0:12:31.452]: 
  Ta-da!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:34.472 --> 0:12:35.502]: 
  Why is it with you?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:36.885 --> 0:12:39.839]: 
  Yeah, and then right after that we did the two-block one and then yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:38.505 --> 0:13:12.694]: 
  one and then we also did the Pokemon one. That's right. I think the best one was probably Stamper only because it was so unexpected because I've been talking to Joy like on the forums and stuff or whatever and we've been talking a little bit so I didn't really know a whole lot of people when I showed up to Pico Day for the first time but when I did show up Joy came over and she was like hey someone wants to meet you and I was like oh who's that? It's like Stamper and I was like oh Stamper like you know I hadn't read too much. Oh Cosmic Death. Yeah. Yeah phenomenal artist but anyways so she had mentioned that Stamper wanted to meet and I was like oh what does that mean?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:40.497 --> 0:12:41.661]: 
  That's right. That's right.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:02.232 --> 0:13:04.695]: 
  You know, I hadn't read too much of it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:05.792 --> 0:13:05.843]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:12.492 --> 0:13:16.896]: 
  It's like, yeah, he's out in the parking lot. And I was like, oh, okay.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:16.137 --> 0:13:36.032]: 
  Okay, but then I went over and literally he just like I walked over it And he just like he was leaning up against his card and he stood up and he stuck his arms out for a hug And I was like, okay, and that was it. That's literally it. Yeah, this is the same way for me only I was more Introverse when I went up to you intro verse. Mm-hmm intro verse

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:35.492 --> 0:13:39.829]: 
  your your lexicon of words

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:39.407 --> 0:15:21.940]: 
  He said something yesterday was like evidence or so he said he said he wasn't it was amazing No, I love it I you throw it out with so much confidence like this is what this word Well, you can't crack down on because you always understand it right anyways, that was my best and worst. What are you Chris? My worst first impression draws with Mick and stamper because first time I met you Mick you were drunk off your tits, right? Yeah, and you know it's not bad, right? I just didn't I didn't know right, but basically Mick came up to me a peek of days like Man he'd like grab me and started hanging off of me and swinging me around Jack Matthews is the I'm making a fan animation. I was like, oh cool, dude I didn't know what to say to him because he was fucking screaming in my ear Anyways, you swinging me around the room screaming and I was like, yeah But I know you now you're the nice man I've ever met but Me too Also stamper was weird because he said that hole. Yeah, you know that whole spiel like yeah, I don't like you and I was like Oh like big inspiration I fucking shat my pants and When I first impression was Corey. Yeah, because you were a fucking cyber bully maniac asshole that scared the shit I don't get this. Cory. This is not a joke, right? The only reason I was ever nice to you was because I was afraid You bully me People no Corey and his little gang they were fucking scary they would ruin people on like with their cartoons and shit So I don't know but I'm not gonna go do all of it But I met Corey because I made a video of making your death Chris I think you're dead and Corey I remember when Corey said he one of my people on the video and said why all these faggots say you hate only I was like Oh, who's this guy? Yeah, he's like at me on Skype. I'm doing I'm doing this big controversial cartoon or whatever and the second I started

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:42.681 --> 0:13:44.031]: 
  It's amazing. No, I love it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:47.069 --> 0:13:47.879]: 
  Well, you can't cry.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:49.583 --> 0:13:50.022]: 
  Right.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:51.608 --> 0:13:51.625]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:51.625 --> 0:13:52.384]: 
  What are you, Chris?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:20.835 --> 0:14:21.949]: 
  Yeah, this is a fucking fucking book.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:29.273 --> 0:14:29.509]: 
  I did.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:49.506 --> 0:14:50.890]: 
  That scared the shit out of me

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:50.232 --> 0:14:50.367]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:50.367 --> 0:14:51.160]: 
  You're the shit.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:57.285 --> 0:14:57.319]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:57.319 --> 0:14:58.770]: 
  And put it really good.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:05.250 --> 0:15:05.301]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:24.994 --> 0:15:51.488]: 
  I'm saying I'm the outlier because a lot of people had that vibe where like man this guy is like an asshole I will say that Corey with Corey's abilities He he does kind of have a superpower and when he was on the dark side It was such a date like you just didn't want to be on his bad side. I'm glad you smile more I mean stamper you even had the kind of thing like you're a juxtapose something like man, Corey This is like a fucking big whole video about you if you get all his bad stuff over Corey gets information about people

 SPEAKER_04 [0:15:29.314 --> 0:15:29.685]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:29.685 --> 0:15:30.597]: 
  I will say

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:30.040 --> 0:15:30.445]: 
  I will say

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:41.329 --> 0:15:41.751]: 
  Orange.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:53.429 --> 0:16:05.039]: 
  You don't even know how he gets it either. It's like yeah when you were 7 you had your diaper or whatever. You wore a diaper until you were 7 and Corrine's like makes a video about that and you're crying your diaper. He just calls up this guy and he gets a manila envelope.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:53.952 --> 0:15:57.799]: 
  You don't even know how he gets it either. It's like yeah, when you were seven, you should have a guy.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:00.887 --> 0:16:03.334]: 
  You're playing your diaper. He just calls up this guy.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:01.495 --> 0:16:02.001]: 
  diaper

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:04.988 --> 0:16:11.080]: 
  like a photo with a paperclip on it. Yeah, yeah, he put the visor. I guess all this confidential information. I'm not brainless.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:06.490 --> 0:17:01.519]: 
  Yeah, yeah, he put the visor. But he has all this confidential information. I'm not going to bring that. Like, you were a dick or anything. I was just afraid because you were already making troll videos about people, right? And I knew that much. And I was like, OK, this guy and his friends, they seem like they would fuck you if you fuck with them. So I'm going to be nice. That's the only reason that I was nice, right? Oh, dude, that whole group I was with, they were all like. Sorry, let me clarify for you. I'm not saying I was only nice to you because I'm nice to most people, like everyone almost, right? But I was extra nice. And you were actually nice to your group. I was going to say, the moral of the story is, I'm like a mob bully. And no, the moral is that, yes, a bit the bully is a beater. The moral of the story is, Corey bullied, or he was mean to people who usually kind of warranted it. Yeah, that's about it. You're so nice. That's the reason I brought it up. You got fucking Oscar for bullying people. I wouldn't do it anymore. I have to put my time toward things that actually came on it. Everyone's growing up since. We're all big boys, though. But yeah, it's weird, though, because that group, it's almost like being in like a,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:26.959 --> 0:16:27.465]: 
  He's rolling.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:32.562 --> 0:16:38.350]: 
  Yeah, but I was like you asked you nice to go to say the moral of the story is I'm like a mom please I know that

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:38.350 --> 0:16:39.109]: 
  Yes

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:48.441 --> 0:16:49.403]: 
  Yeah, you can go fucking...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:48.998 --> 0:16:49.319]: 
  Fuck

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:54.955 --> 0:16:57.891]: 
  Everyone's grown up since. We're all big boys now. But.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:02.734 --> 0:17:05.771]: 
  I was about to use another word for my thesaurus that makes no fucking sense.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:06.210 --> 0:17:11.002]: 
  Alright, I don't want you to censor yourself. I didn't mean to say that. It literally makes no sense what I was saying.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:08.387 --> 0:17:09.518]: 
  It's cool like that.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:10.175 --> 0:19:25.125]: 
  No sense what I was gonna say. It was almost gonna slip out of my mouth. Say the word. I wanna hear it now. All right, I was gonna be like it was almost like I was stuck in my own fraternal Twilight Zone episode. See, with every opening of out it's never bad. It can never be bad. That's what I was going to say. And it's because like all these guys had this facade. I had no idea who the fuck they were. One guy's identity probably is non-existent and he either faked his own death or he just Like I'm not even joking. This is like some shit that like people and another one was like completely the exact opposite It would be like what's a movie where a guy Says he's something like an identity theft who says he's somebody but he's like the exact opposite of that somebody like a serial killer Who's like I'm this and he describes himself and then when you meet it He's the exact opposite of what he was describing. I'm sure they exist. Yeah One comedian yeah, they got like five percent wrong tomato That's literally like my Existence like in that group was I was with these guys and they were just horrible like they would just spend their whole time on new Grounds boasting about how impressive their Whistle status was and how many cool how many like thoughtful reviews they leave how much of a thumbs up And they would just they would did yeah, and they would just shit on everyone they shit on Mick They would shit on you they would shit on Aaron. They should on Chris really. Yeah They were fans of you the kind of guys who when like if there's ten of you in a Skype call and one guy leaves They're all like they all like that guy's a fag and he's a piece of shit Yeah, when that guy comes back and a different guy leaves there all the rest of the guys like that guy's a piece of shit Yeah, they're all the colors were like one of the guys would leave it They don't shit talk of the second cup like really shit talk him. Yeah, really shit talk. It was like super toxic It was like the second they came back in that they would like be quiet shit talk somebody else Yeah, exactly I remember like I never had anything against Mick and I was kind of getting tired of them like shitting on Mick and then like There was that time I was trying to set up API or whatever for a flash cartoon And I was like I'm gonna ask Mick since he's smart and he knows this kind of stuff and I asked him Then he was very helpful and then it made me realize like it's like why am I this kind of like you you if you're in like that Perfect world and then suddenly you start like scraping at the wall and you realize outside the world is like this dark gray area Where everything is the opposite and horrible and you're like wait, I'm living in a lot

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:11.002 --> 0:17:13.872]: 
  But it was almost gonna slip out of my mouth.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:14.867 --> 0:17:15.964]: 
  I wanna hear it now.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:17:21.567 --> 0:17:24.942]: 
  See, Carl, whatever you're mad at, it's never bad. It can never be bad.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:58.860 --> 0:18:00.919]: 
  Yeah, and it's like a little bit of like talentedness.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:03.687 --> 0:18:04.007]: 
  That's what I'm talking about.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:04.007 --> 0:18:04.682]: 
  That's literally...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:07.905 --> 0:18:08.952]: 
  Oh, you're saying you're just...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:08.952 --> 0:18:09.576]: 
  horrible like this.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:18:26.400 --> 0:18:30.636]: 
  They shit on Chris really? Yeah they shit on all the other ones. I thought they were fans of you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:40.778 --> 0:18:41.453]: 
  I don't know what you're talking about.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:48.186 --> 0:18:48.591]: 
  In the second...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:18:52.084 --> 0:18:53.502]: 
  Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:53.502 --> 0:18:53.991]: 
  I remember

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:24.940 --> 0:19:30.525]: 
  Wow, that's really, that's some pretty deep imagery for it. I think that's basically what it was.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:27.707 --> 0:19:49.999]: 
  I think it's basically what it was. I was surrounding myself with so much people who were assholes, yet I realized like it's like, poisonous. Yeah, it's toxic. Look, I think there's like an appropriate amount of like self-awareness and honesty and criticism, but then there's like, then there's taking it too far and just being a bitter human being. My favorite part. It relates to everything no matter what it is, how it is, whatever. My favorite part, and we don't need to keep going on about it. Yeah. But, my favorite part is like,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:34.019 --> 0:19:34.997]: 
  Poisonous as well.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:34.997 --> 0:19:35.909]: 
  Yeah, it's look like a

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:46.607 --> 0:19:46.776]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:49.999 --> 0:20:05.018]: 
  My favorite part though was you were saying that at the end of the- I didn't even know until later until you told me Corey that one of the main reasons you- you would ask like dude what- why are you being so mean and then it ended up boiling down to I don't like his face. Yeah oh no yeah. He was like look at him he looks like a born-nickle.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:03.482 --> 0:20:32.997]: 
  Like look at him. He looks like he's born next to a radiation. I know people like that where I'm like I hate your face Oh my god, it was like it was like eight-year-old schoolyard insults like What are these guys were fucking Brad? Yeah, I was like why don't you like Mick? He's like have you seen him? He looks ugly And I'm like oh my god And then I had to like I'll tell you if you're fucking a different model with a six-pack Yeah, like a ten inch dick you could really good. Okay.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:32.997 --> 0:20:37.384]: 
  Hey, I don't think I'm the prettiest, but I just thought that was the funniest reason to be like, I hate this guy.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:37.485 --> 0:20:46.902]: 
  Is that what they hated you? Yeah, that's what it was. That's what it was. That's what it was. Apparently, that's what it boiled down to. You're a chiseled man. No. Have you ever seen someone that I've been like, I don't like their face? I'm gonna stay right here.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:39.899 --> 0:20:39.949]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:35.215 --> 0:21:51.060]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:59.639 --> 0:25:00.854]: 
  Seven Chris.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:05.174 --> 0:25:29.879]: 
  We'll forgive you for that. It's a big, it's a big where. We'll put a Mario, like, hang on. What makes you burn out and what do you do to regain motivation? What makes you burn out? What makes you burn out? So what makes you, when you look, you're like, you're like, it's right on hold. What gets you in a rut? Okay, how do you get out of it? I feel like that's a multifaceted response. Yeah. Because I feel like a lot of people get burnt out because they're doing work that they don't want to be doing. Oh, I see what you're saying. They're working for other people.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:13.915 --> 0:25:14.894]: 
  makes you burn out.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:14.134 --> 0:25:14.219]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:14.151 --> 0:25:14.725]: 
  So, Burnout!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:17.138 --> 0:25:18.437]: 
  What gets you in a rut?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:18.437 --> 0:25:19.450]: 
  How do you get out of this?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:19.450 --> 0:25:19.754]: 
  out of it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:22.521 --> 0:25:22.639]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:27.212 --> 0:25:28.815]: 
  Don't want to be doing, they're working on it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:29.575 --> 0:25:32.899]: 
  You're saying that you're saying what makes you burn out wouldn't necessarily be what?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:32.899 --> 0:26:06.666]: 
  what makes you burn out during a project? You're talking about what makes you burn out in general? I think we should answer like, what makes each individual person come out and get out of it? I think Stanford's going to do this. I think maybe the answer is not how to regate from burning out, but how to not burn out. Is that what you're going to say for them? Yeah, why not both? Well, yeah. I can tell you what I do. There's that too, yeah. Like for example, we all like what we do. And if most people worked in the same fashion that we worked, they would easily get burned out. Cause like we all work like 12, 14 hour days because we like what we're doing. Now eventually over the years, it'll catch up to me and I'll be like, dude, you need to fucking stop for a second. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:34.587 --> 0:25:36.949]: 
  I would need you to burn out in general.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:36.949 --> 0:25:38.164]: 
  It's a good should answer like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:39.734 --> 0:25:41.370]: 
  I can also, I think...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:45.707 --> 0:25:47.496]: 
  Well, I thought you were gonna say something.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:47.496 --> 0:25:50.567]: 
  Yeah, why not both? Well, yeah. Tell you what I do.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:59.359 --> 0:25:59.511]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:05.654 --> 0:26:12.150]: 
  I think that's why we party so hard too sometimes not all of us but some of us they're like mini vacations. Yeah, it's like you work

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:08.472 --> 0:26:45.479]: 
  Not all of us, but some of us. They're like mini vacations. Yeah, it's like you work for 14 hours for a week and then you just need to get blessed. I'll tell you a golden rule that might solve everybody's problems is to fucking get out more. Like if you're a comedian and you keep hitting brick walls and writer's block, go to the fucking store and observe people. You need to go out and like talk to people. You're not gonna generate ideas for being stuck in your apartment. From your own mind that's already hit a cap. Like the biggest thing is take it, do it for yourself. Just take stuff and use that. Yeah, they go for a court. Whenever I get burned out, another thing that also really helps keep motivation is strength.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:16.015 --> 0:26:16.386]: 
 好 這裡

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:21.010 --> 0:26:21.432]: 
  Like if you're...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:28.435 --> 0:26:29.937]: 
  I might as well talk to you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:29.937 --> 0:26:30.426]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:32.805 --> 0:26:33.700]: 
  from your own.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:33.700 --> 0:26:33.767]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:35.505 --> 0:26:35.522]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:35.522 --> 0:26:37.446]: 
  The biggest thing is it's taken with...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:37.446 --> 0:26:37.632]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:37.632 --> 0:26:40.011]: 
  It takes up and use that.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:39.437 --> 0:26:39.944]: 
  Go for it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:45.090 --> 0:26:47.267]: 
  Pussy!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:46.424 --> 0:27:54.936]: 
  Pussy dick pussy balls tits the whole nine yards. No fucking cool. What bird you out? Yeah, but what how would you get to that? Burnout yeah, what burns you at first um? Either like you know when you're in flash and you're trying to get something and like the brushes aren't working right? So you're getting like you're redoing this line over and you can be in these clunks of shit like yeah fucking clunks I call it shells. Yeah, they're just fucking annoying you have to erase and do it that does it and then you're like It's also like that take much to get you burn out It's when that happens enough times like you can't get the line that you want or let's say you animate something for like six hours And then it doesn't look good or can I delete everything? Can I say this yeah, I don't you work for like a day like this looks all excuse me do it or you look for a day and the file Crubs, it's all gone. Yeah, like well, I'll just do a better tomorrow I just don't give a fuck but for me like this more frustration though I think they mean burn out in a sense where like your battery is drained and you don't want to work anymore That's more like when I go and core as long as I've known you you've never taken a day off you work every day And you've never come for me. I don't think I've ever seen you burn out That's what I mean. I think that's why when he's talking about what burns them out in

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:06.606 --> 0:27:08.800]: 
  They like closed snail shells. Yeah, they're just...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:24.747 --> 0:27:26.130]: 
  Can I delete everything?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:27:36.222 --> 0:27:36.306]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:27:38.297 --> 0:27:39.884]: 
  I think they mean burnout.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:42.752 --> 0:27:42.870]: 
  Thank you very much.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:27:48.422 --> 0:27:48.490]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:27:49.874 --> 0:27:50.869]: 
  I don't think I've ever seen

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:54.936 --> 0:28:01.804]: 
  It ends up being like more frustration like when my pen tool isn't working rather than like oh well my life is you know

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:55.780 --> 0:27:56.775]: 
  Yeah, it's true.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:01.450 --> 0:28:23.944]: 
  And then he went to fucking Wawa and there was no roast beef left. Yeah, and then he just fucking crumbled. So for me, like, what I usually do is I need a new scenery. That's why I stream getting people in talking to you keeps you motivated. Oh, streaming's good too. Streaming helps keep you like working new projects. Even though I don't do it, yeah. But after a while, that'll burn you out because getting online and having to talk to it and so you want to go back to doing your normal thing again.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:28:04.740 --> 0:28:05.230]: 
  I like it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:28:06.006 --> 0:28:06.546]: 
  World

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:14.241 --> 0:28:15.895]: 
  Oh streaming is good too.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:17.076 --> 0:28:18.342]: 
  Even though I don't do it, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:23.944 --> 0:28:27.066]: 
  you working now you're kind of also kind of entertaining to you also

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:24.855 --> 0:28:34.508]: 
  Yeah, it's so kind of entertaining to you also like setting mini goals each day for certain things like you're like today I'm gonna do this realistic ones. Yeah accomplish. So you feel like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:34.035 --> 0:28:35.689]: 
  feel like a big fat failure.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:35.352 --> 0:29:29.200]: 
  Yeah, like if I'm doing like a boss movement of something and then I do like I'm like okay So today I'm gonna do this hands-white movement. Yeah, and then I spent all day doing it and then by the end of the day It's like exactly how I set it up And then that's by the end of the day. I just do whatever like drink whatever to celebrate I actually got something to say on that I actually I feel that long-term goals are bad and that you should know not long-term goals mini goals Well, that's what I mean. You can also have long-term short-term goals You can have in five years. I want to get a small term goal done Well, what I mean is like what I mean is like let's say that you want to have like a TV show, right? Yeah, that's your long-term goal and you can get burned out working on that like I mean a long time ago I wanted to be like the world's best fucking web designer That's a long-term goal and then along the way, you know, I started doing more cartoons and now I'm doing more voice acting than anything I don't design websites anymore So I could see how somebody could get burned out by going for these long-term goals that they never reach or They don't see because they got this tunnel vision

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:37.664 --> 0:28:37.697]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:28:55.180 --> 0:28:55.855]: 
  You know, now the

 SPEAKER_04 [0:28:57.053 --> 0:28:57.930]: 
  Well that's what I mean.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:02.031 --> 0:29:03.027]: 
  Well, what I mean is like...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:29:28.829 --> 0:29:32.710]: 
  Well that could I think that's like that could be really nice right now

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:30.449 --> 0:29:55.997]: 
  That could be remedied by having short term goals comprise the long term goals. So that's the solution. So make your days and weeks and let's follow short term goals. But maybe you have a long term goal, but don't only have a long term goal, because that's going to be a long- And you never know where you're going to end up in the five years. You need little goals. Have a day where you go out and just drink and hang out with people. Yeah, I think especially with creatives, what's hard is like, if you're not necessarily creative, and you're not really creative, and you're not really creative, and you're

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:34.448 --> 0:29:34.650]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:29:36.507 --> 0:29:38.194]: 
  So that's the solution.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:50.462 --> 0:29:51.627]: 
  Yeah, I think so.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:55.997 --> 0:29:58.410]: 
  and I'm not trying to like drive a division between it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:58.410 --> 0:30:40.935]: 
  And it applies to everybody, I think, but when you do have long-term goals, sometimes while I think it's noble and that it's great to have something that you're working towards, you can't have tunnel vision and ignore the fact that your goal might change in route. And then you wasted all the time. And you have to keep your eyes open to the potential. Exactly. Because if you ignore those things, like I want to be the best web designer and all of a sudden you fall in love with animation or voice acting, you're like, no, no, no, no, I can't go that route. I'm going right for the web design. You're ignoring something at that point. And I think creatives kind of get that because we're constantly exploring different mediums, whether it's music or animation. And had I had that tunnel vision, I wouldn't be voice acting in Xbox. Right, exactly.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:13.041 --> 0:30:14.037]: 
  in route.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:30:14.037 --> 0:30:14.948]: 
  to what you thought you were.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:14.948 --> 0:30:16.011]: 
  All the time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:16.990 --> 0:30:17.175]: 
  That's right.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:35.451 --> 0:30:36.582]: 
  Yeah, the animator.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:40.395 --> 0:30:50.453]: 
  Exactly. I would have completely. So to keep your eyes open and follow, not sound cheesy, but follow your heart and follow your path. And that is, that is a daily goal, many goals.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:46.791 --> 0:32:17.494]: 
  That is Like even weekly goals is another thing also is there's two more things I guess like this is kind of how I come about it This is kind of what Chad does too is to like take breaks like take two hours play a game Set set mini goals inside the game as well like be like I'm gonna play to this point and then that's it Like he does that as well, and I that's a good idea, too, and I also think Experience new things. That's another thing. I was gonna say like what shows that you would never watch yeah Go to a fucking restaurant. You've never been yeah exactly like just do other things and another thing like I'm trying to do is I'm trying to perfect my art skill so on the side when I'm not doing animation I'm also trying to learn how to draw and learn art and stuff Exactly your work muscles what what loads of people don't realize when they get stuck in a road is that maybe they've got to a point Where they're plateauing almost in their head, but they're forgetting that you're supposed to constantly challenge yourself exactly If you ever have to be learning True because when I do you ever get to a point where you say I'm good. I know at all you don't yeah Yeah, that's when you'll get stuck in a right when I do art I'm not doing these like generic like see me poses I'm really trying to do like for shortening and like all these like really difficult poses that people don't normally do so you can Practice like neck angles and all this like crazy details. You will never know everything There's always something you know you'll be 70 years old all the years old I still have not perfected the art is good to have but but I'm still trying you're pretty good at it though. Yeah, I'm learning

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:11.294 --> 0:31:12.779]: 
  Experience new things.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:13.859 --> 0:31:14.618]: 
  What shows

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:29.890 --> 0:31:34.362]: 
  So you're changing it up. Exactly. You're working different muscles. Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:34.362 --> 0:31:34.379]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:45.027 --> 0:31:45.449]: 
  That's exactly what I'm talking about.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:31:45.449 --> 0:31:46.022]: 
  You need to stay in there.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:46.883 --> 0:31:47.322]: 
  so

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:47.001 --> 0:31:47.609]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:31:47.322 --> 0:31:47.727]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:50.157 --> 0:31:51.507]: 
  Yeah, and that's when you get started.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31 --> 0:31:52.367]: 
  That's when you'll get stuck in a road.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:04.804 --> 0:32:05.513]: 
  you will never

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:06.593 --> 0:32:07.859]: 
  There's always something you need.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:32:07.859 --> 0:32:09.411]: 
  He'll be 70 years old. He'll always be 70.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:11.065 --> 0:32:11.200]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:17.494 --> 0:32:20.059]: 
  I think when you learn other things too, and Chris, you're one of the best.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:20.059 --> 0:32:29.492]: 
  people that I think have touched and used damper as well as far as like the after effects and design and music and like there's just so many different things I can only assume that when you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:29.492 --> 0:32:35.770]: 
  learn all these different, you know, types of artistic expression that they influence the other shit. That's actually one...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:33.998 --> 0:32:55.142]: 
  The other that's actually one drawback for me is if I spent too much time on one thing I'll forget the other thing and I'll get me stuck in a rut and that thing so it's really If you spend a lot of time music you'll forget a little bit about it totally like oh I could be like doing art for two weeks straight now that I'll consider myself like I'm finally getting the hang of this And then I'll stop for like a week to do music. I'll come back. I'll forgotten like how no I feel that way when I can I can I?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:41.507 --> 0:32:41.524]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [0:32:41.524 --> 0:32:42.132]: 
  처�

 SPEAKER_04 [0:32:43.617 --> 0:32:45.254]: 
  Totally, like, like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:54.214 --> 0:32:56.003]: 
  Can I tell you what I do?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:56.003 --> 0:34:10.844]: 
  whatever I feel like I'm gonna run. Take one day off, don't turn your computer off, don't do anything. Or even leave your computer on, but don't open any kind of, don't do any work, just do nothing. It'll make you miss it. So you feel like, yeah, you'll feel like a big piece of shit, you'll feel lazy and the whole day you'll be idiot. So literally, do nothing. Don't do nothing for half the day, do nothing for all the day. Get take out, watch movies, purposely be a slob, and by the next day you'll fucking spray out of bed and start working. And it sounds like a scam for a nice yesterday. Yeah, no, but you feel, but you woke up today and you're like, I need to work. No, it's absolutely true. It's weird too, because people say, I get burned out, but it's like, really? I'm a workaholic. It's in my, like, my dad was a workaholic. He was obsessed with work. He used to actually go out, purchase things to work. Else, what are you doing on this planet? Everyone should be working. Yeah, he would go out and he would buy a building and he'd be like, this is gonna be my new gym. This is gonna be my new smoothie gym, bar, sauna, fucking everything. And then he'd be like, this is gonna be my new art studio. This is gonna be my so-and-so. This is gonna be my, and I would go out there and I would have to work. And he would just do it. Yeah. Because he always had to have work to do because he just cannot not work. I think there's like- Can I, can I, we talked to this a little bit, Mick. You and I talked about this. You brought up a good point though, about like everyone kind of wants to, like people who, this is our version of having kids in a way.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:06.432 --> 0:33:07.022]: 
  so you feel like you're...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:20.640 --> 0:33:22.598]: 
  It sounds like Stanford nice yesterday.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:22.598 --> 0:33:26.867]: 
  Yeah, no, but you feel but you woke up today like I need to walk you know exactly absolutely

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:56.955 --> 0:33:57.310]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:10.844 --> 0:34:11.772]: 
  Oh yeah, that's...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:11.620 --> 0:34:23.938]: 
  I thought that was a really interesting point. I never thought of it like that But like when people who have kids that's the way of living on and that's their dedication That's their goal so challenge. That's their challenge, but with us. It's like this is what? We're constantly leaving

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:22.487 --> 0:34:29.844]: 
  constantly leaving something behind. Yeah exactly that's what people do when they have kids. So that's what I think.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:24.529 --> 0:34:27.246]: 
  Yeah, exactly. That's what people do when they have kids.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:27.920 --> 0:34:46.737]: 
  So that's so I think I think I think if you're a really dedicated parent It's no different to be a really dedicated guy who is really dedicated to his work Right and that was kind of things like there was plenty of you know quote-unquote Uncreative people but you know not not in a derogatory term But the idea that a lot of these people have decided that children are a good way whether it's conscious or subconscious. Yeah

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:29.844 --> 0:34:30.047]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:34.502 --> 0:34:35.684]: 
  right and that was kind of things

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:46.737 --> 0:34:53.351]: 
  the children are their creation. It's the thing that they leave behind, it's the thing that they invest their time in and all that kind of stuff. But for us, for so many,

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:53.351 --> 0:34:58.634]: 
  some of us, we don't necessarily have that urge only because we've got a fan base that we love.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:57.114 --> 0:35:00.996]: 
  You know, we've got a fan base that we love to share our stories with or we have

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:00.996 --> 0:35:46.829]: 
  You know the work that we create that we're leaving behind but all the things I feel like I would do work You know if I had a child or the things that I feel like I like to do on a daily basis with everybody Yeah, you know I'm not saying it's black and white like that But I was gonna say as far as like the thing that kind of can burn me out and Stamper touch right at the very beginning and that's when you just have too many things going on So it's like whether you've got and you learn you need to learn how to say no to people that Child never yet that I have to learn that is true But the biggest thing is that for a stress is the thing and so I over the years. I think now I'm pretty good I feel like there's very few things that could literally max me out in terms of stress And just because you can do it doesn't mean you should be that's true too. It's just not healthy, but at the same time

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:11.138 --> 0:35:12.640]: 
  Yeah, you know, I'm not saying it's...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:15.002 --> 0:35:15.542]: 
  as far as

 SPEAKER_04 [0:35:23.102 --> 0:35:23.237]: 
  Hey

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:24.300 --> 0:35:24.486]: 
  God.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:27.102 --> 0:35:28.249]: 
  That's how their shit shut-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:46.829 --> 0:35:50.862]: 
  I've noticed that if I have too much stress and I'm not

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:49.495 --> 0:35:56.447]: 
  and I'm not just totally shut down you shut down. Yeah, literally just shut down you stare at your computer or you stare at your Cintiq

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:51.857 --> 0:35:52.499]: 
  You shut down.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:56.447 --> 0:35:59.755]: 
  You're like frozen, you're locked, and the only- It's like an evolution.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:59.097 --> 0:36:35.479]: 
  It's an evolutionary reaction. It is. It's overwhelmed. So you have to be able to find the way, whether it's you take breaks, or you do try a new thing, or whatever, and come back to it, or you do get trashed, or you do get lazy and become a slob and watch your favorite movies, you need to find a way to relieve that. I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, what I think is important. If you look at kind of like a boulder of work, you just get overwhelmed. But I think the best thing you do is break, again, mini goals. Break the big piece down and break it into little pieces. Okay, what can I do in five minutes? What can I do in one hour? What can I do with that? We segregated, separated. I think having the long.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:00.379 --> 0:36:00.447]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:02.252 --> 0:36:02.708]: 
  Cent vous Bud's

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:17.406 --> 0:36:21.186]: 
  I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, what do you think?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:19.937 --> 0:36:20.545]: 
  What the use of it?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:29.556 --> 0:36:30.957]: 
  Okay, what kind of good five minutes?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:34.484 --> 0:36:41.436]: 
  Having the long-term goal is nice, but I like we said you shouldn't be blind towards going towards it set a goal But you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:41.436 --> 0:36:44.946]: 
  as you're going towards it because look I I wish it doesn't get any

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:44.642 --> 0:36:46.431]: 
  anywhere without a fucking destiny

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:46.347 --> 0:37:16.671]: 
  I would say definitely, I wouldn't discourage setting long term goals, I would encourage setting short term goals within the long term goal. So that if you need to turn it into a turn, exactly. While you're moving forward. And that way you accomplish 20 short term goals and hey, the long term, because if you just have one long term goal, then if you can happily or you can't do it, then you didn't accomplish anything. But if you set a long term goal and have 20 short term goals between the start and the end, and you can have it over in some way, you got 10 short term goals, okay you did something. You always accomplish something so long as you're working. Yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:53.080 --> 0:36:53.485]: 
  great.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:53.434 --> 0:36:54.936]: 
  and then being receptive.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:54.447 --> 0:36:55.949]: 
  You need to turn anywhere you turn.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:37:10.444 --> 0:37:12.435]: 
  Move forward in some way.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:37:16.671 --> 0:37:20.940]: 
  Also, I'll say pay more attention to your artistic pals or get some

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:20.940 --> 0:37:35.048]: 
  if you don't have them. They're autistic pals too. If one of your pals makes a cartoon and it's really funny, then it's good for motivation as well because you can do it. It's healthy competition. You can be like, I could be funnier than that. And, yeah, yeah. And, I think that every time I watch your show. And, oh, oh.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:22.493 --> 0:37:22.949]: 
  should.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:37:30.863 --> 0:37:31.943]: 
  And...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:31.943 --> 0:37:34.407]: 
  And every time I watch you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:35.925 --> 0:37:41.899]: 
  And if one of your autistic friends writes a very good fanfic, you can also get encouraged.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:39.655 --> 0:37:45.274]: 
  Yeah, I'm also getting you know, I honestly think you are artistically good at the trombone. Thank you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:39.705 --> 0:37:40.077]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:44.498 --> 0:38:52.943]: 
  Thank you. I've never seen any like we just rip out It's like you're themes and you are just playing them and even if they're not perfect I can hear you reaching towards it just with this fucking piece of plastic It's amazing the funny story is with the trombone because I played for like 11 years And I was in a band at like one point and we tried that but I never knew how to read music I knew certain musical terms and I knew like but the trombone is a scale instrument It is just like Yeah it's just that easy Oh yeah And after a while like the more you hear it the easy it becomes to just sort of like kind of guess the note signatures And after a while like when I was in jazz band I would just go in and then they did do in their boring ass jazz songs like Holding whole notes and shit. I'm just like I don't want to fucking do this So I would like try and like harmonize with the trombones and stuff I wouldn't like you said I'd be fucking Lisa Simpsons You would would be running off out of class. I wouldn't do that because then I get a bad grudge I honestly believe I honestly believe this your skill this quote-unquote skill you have about random association is fucking stupid

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:47.957 --> 0:37:50.775]: 
  It's thank you. I am the stakes, I know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:16.257 --> 0:38:18.670]: 
  Yeah, it's just that easy. Yeah, it's just the slide. Oh, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:40.624 --> 0:38:40.995]: 
  He would.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:40.995 --> 0:38:41.603]: 
  and would you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:52.943 --> 0:38:55.491]: 
  stupid. Just wait. OK? No. It's the duck.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:55.491 --> 0:39:01.380]: 
  thing I fucking heard. Oh yeah do me do me give me a word. Give me a word. Banana. Fire truck. Nooooo!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:57.280 --> 0:38:57.904]: 
  Yeah, do me a word.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:01.380 --> 0:39:14.526]: 
  That's not what I was thinking. No, what I'm saying, I don't care what you were thinking. What I'm saying is, is that you should, I was thinking Daisy. Oh God, you should bring your trombone with you. I should, I should. That is an awesome skill. That's a good idea.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:39:04.519 --> 0:39:05.498]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:04.823 --> 0:39:05.852]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:35.449 --> 0:41:37.440]:

  Wait for him to sit down.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:44.157 --> 0:41:45.338]: 
  I was in the bathroom.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:41:44.984 --> 0:41:45.237]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:48.477 --> 0:41:56.999]: 
  I noticed that the other day. Alright, Boba Cooche says, What do you guys think about your younger audiences? Should they?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:56.999 --> 0:46:14.562]: 
  be watching slash listening to your stuff. Alright, so here's the deal. When I was 14, I was watching the most heinous shit ever, and I turned out just fine. It's like, you know what, here's the thing though, even when I was a kid, I still drew my own boundaries. Yeah, I watched like shit, but then there was places that I wouldn't go. Same thing. Like, cause I still had like this, I still had a trigger that, not a trigger, I still had a filter. Yeah, your limit. A threshold. For me, it was more like, I didn't want my parents seeing the history of my computer. Is he fucking 14 or a kid? That's another reason, but like, the other reason is I also didn't like certain things. I wasn't a fan of people getting mutilated and gore. I hated blood when I was a kid. So seeing that stuff, I avoided it at any chance I got. Once I, like, when I found out about rotten.com, that fucking scarred me, and I just remember that one thing, and I never looked at that kind of stuff. I always avoided it. At the same time, what kind of shitty question is that? Cause it's like, it's not like we're bad people doing it. It's an age old question. Like, should certain content be made or should, how can you make sure younger audience don't watch that? But I never got that question because I've always viewed kids. I mean, I think people are really underestimate how smart kids are. I remember being like five years old, my parents were like mouth out the word fuck, you know, F-U-C-K. It's like, kids aren't stupid. Kids are exactly as self aware and conscious as we are. The only difference between age five and like 15 is that you know a little bit more shit. 15 to 30. You get used slightly, and it's like being 30 to 80. It's like thinking a 30 year old is a stupid computer. But I feel like the internet is like, it's different. It's fair game. When you go on the internet. It's a wild west. Yeah, it's like. So, but I mean like a 14 year old knows he wants to watch something raw or whatever. And it's like this, it's like, there's people who censor themselves, but then there's also stuff on the internet. It's just straight fucking porn. Like there's no censors. And it's like, people will try to dictate it. It's like, oh, this is the internet, but it's fine. It's like, if you want your audience to be kids' audience, it's based entirely on what you mean. Cause like, if you give your kids internet access and don't like watch what they do, it's fair game. It's not up to the people. It's up to you to be a good fucking parent if you don't want your kids to watch some stuff. It's what, it's also like. I was still clever though when I was a kid, even though they didn't want me to watch it. Every kid is, I'm saying kids aren't stupid, dude. And often baffles me. What often baffles me is like, in a situation like this, where people will like get upset about that. This is another thing that always confused me. These mature games that come out, like Grand Theft Auto. It's like, my kid was playing Grand Theft Auto, and he was killing a hooker, and he's like 13 years old. And it's like, they're good. Where did he get the money to buy it? Yeah, it's like, why is your 13 year old kid? How can he bring this up to the court? And be like, my 13 year old son was playing a rated R basically game. And it's like, that's your own goddamn fault. That's the fact of people. He get a job and then money, and then went to the store to buy a kid. They won't even sell it to kids. A parent bought it for them. I remember my dad took me to an R rated movie, and got really mad when there was like, swear, and he swore down on the door. It's fucking, it's, it's 10 or 11 or more. I don't understand. Like it's like kids are dumbass. No, it's rated R. The guy who told us. What did you do to start on the internet anyways? 1996. No, like how old were you guys? 15. You were 15 when you got to the R. Wow, really? Okay, you? That was like 13 or 14. 13? Yeah, I was a bit, I was really at that point. Because I didn't understand it. I was at the door, as you look kind of sports kid. I played outside a lot until I was like probably 13. Yeah, we did too. I got it when I was 11. I just didn't understand what the internet was. I didn't, because I didn't have. I think it's probably a little bit different. My internet was fucking like black with white text. I didn't use it to get more of a comeback. It was all chat rooms, just when I... I wasn't allowed to use it until I was 13, right? But like, I'm just wondering like... There's chat rooms and floods. I used to go to YouTube and it's like I am 70 years old. Yeah, somebody like, somebody will be in a video, or a music video that came out like 2009, and they're like I was four or three when this came out. And they're like what? Oh, Charlie! You guys are saying right? Don't bite me! You guys are saying like, yeah, you should like, like smart kids on the internet, because they know what to do in any ways, right? But like, do you guys not think like, when the younger kid is, the more likely they're gonna make a complete ass to themselves on the internet and then stuff like that? I'm not saying... Look, look, look. All of us got lucky, because when we were kids, we did stupid shit, it got erased. Maybe we did some dinner, said some stupid shit, but it got erased because it was pretty early. Well now we're doing it on the podcast and it's gonna do history. I can't put that out there. That's a ruin from something I put on the internet. Yeah, that was like, now, dude, if you were born like 2010, good lord, your life's gonna be all over. You were joking about like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:16.169 --> 0:42:16.439]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:42:57.580 --> 0:42:58.390]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:38.440 --> 0:46:43.165]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:42.794 --> 0:46:55.450]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's like, my guy's worried about like taxes and you know fair game for everybody He's like, but he also did a video of like sticky He didn't need to say that, he just heard His rebuttal was literally just like yeah, that's

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:50.961 --> 0:47:02.234]: 
  He didn't even say that. His rebuttal was literally just like, yeah, that's a great point to make about taxes. But how about this? And he just presses play.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:55.450 --> 0:46:58.504]: 
  That's a good point you make about taxes. But how about this?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:58.504 --> 0:46:58.825]: 
  Please press the bell.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:01.491 --> 0:47:44.404]: 
  He's practicing, he's practicing his Naruto movements. He falls over and takes a lamb. I rushed my case and everyone's like, that's a good point. That's a good point. He pulls up him and he's like, whatever dude, I got dirt too. That's true. He's like, it's all scared and then he pops it up and it's like him. It's true. It's like him singing to his first girlfriend like a fucking backstreet boy song. He's like, I was just learning. I didn't understand what I was getting into. As far as the question though, like how I feel about our younger audiences listening to us, I'll say this. I think it kind of plays into what everyone said is that kids are going to find shit. They're going to find the dirtiest. They're going to find the nastiest. Humans are naturally draw to that. You'll be curious and they're growing up and whatever. But I will say that no matter how extreme it is,

 SPEAKER_04 [0:47:06.435 --> 0:47:12.409]: 
  He falls over and gets a lamb. I rest my case and everyone's like, that's a good point. That is a good point. He pulls up him.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:12.595 --> 0:47:12.949]: 
  And he's a

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:14.789 --> 0:47:15.244]: 
  Thank you guys for watching.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:36.794 --> 0:47:39.240]: 
  You would have naturally draw to that, man.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:44.404 --> 0:47:47.678]: 
  extreme we are at times. I think at the end of the day, you know, we

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:47.678 --> 0:47:57.077]: 
  we make jokes about race and we make jokes about all sorts of shit. But I think at the end of the day everyone knows that we do believe that you should treat people with respect.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:55.947 --> 0:48:09.497]: 
  Yeah, and that you you know, we're not fucking trolls and we're not here to know this is coming We're not bullies pushing people over and shit like that No, no, there's nothing you can see and be a good person But I think that's what they would get though is that they would get the fun wacky

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:59.457 --> 0:48:01.600]: 
  We're not bullies pushing bullies.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:03.102 --> 0:48:06.274]: 
  No, there's no way you can see that he's a good person.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:09.497 --> 0:48:25.461]: 
  rebellion side but at the same time don't be a fucking idiot like have fun and be crazy and be yourself but don't be a fucking asshole and I would even so I would even go so far and say hopefully some of the stupid stars we tell like oh man when I was 15 I did this hopefully that can make people learn and that like I don't think people would be encouraged but that was the one thing I did

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:24.533 --> 0:48:30.996]: 
  But that was the one thing I didn't have when I was younger like if I did see that rebellious shit I was always turned on by you know because I wasn't allowed to

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:26.575 --> 0:48:26.845]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:30.996 --> 0:48:39.214]: 
  to do that and seeing other people do it got me all psyched but I never got to see the other side of it which was you know yeah we're being crazy and raunchy.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:48:38.624 --> 0:48:41.661]: 
  but also do your taxes and make your bed.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:40.328 --> 0:49:01.945]: 
  We tell you can play don't be a dick to any situation. We should also tell you But so many people don't learn that especially with their kids. They can be delicious the fucking we should also be bold This also I think we should also tell people that if you have videos of like let's say you lip-syncing the cotton I Joe you should probably private that Run for president you dick. I'm trying to hold back myself

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:43.298 --> 0:48:43.315]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:59.751 --> 0:49:02.316]: 
  I'm trying to hold back myself especially.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:01.945 --> 0:49:02.384]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:16.255 --> 0:49:55.439]: 
  I was just spending like 16 times. I have nothing fucking on Also, I think it's cool like if you know like 12 14 whatever kids are listening and we tell stories about how school was hard You know, it's relatable. No, that's what I also like and that's another thing I really like it may sound weird to say but it's like make you and stamper and Jeff are older than us and But you're not that much older than us, but like we all know like our high school years So it's like kind of interesting in that way, you know, it's funny I don't think we ever run out of high school stores that that was literally the most like so much fucking shit happened Good and bad mostly weird and awkward, but I that that was literally like college was a

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:27.527 --> 0:49:29.333]: 
  You know it's relatable. No, it is.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:49 --> 0:49:28.506]: 
  It's relatable.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:55.439 --> 0:50:07.943]: 
  big drunken drug induced blur for me and then everything after that was work but high school was like this really bizarre time of of like betrayals

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:05.040 --> 0:50:16.448]:

  Throw the biscuit and they all just...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:39.767 --> 0:52:40.004]: 
  Let's go.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:40.004 --> 0:52:42.501]: 
  That's not a joke. The last guy you can't do is a biscuit head.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:42.501 --> 0:52:43.429]: 
  to eat the biscuit.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:43.429 --> 0:52:52.947]: 
  You can't do the soggy biscuits. You're like Chris, just eat the biscuit. You're just like, you're probably going to learn that. I'd rather you eat the biscuit than the stamp on your face. So thanks mom, thanks dad.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:46.990 --> 0:52:48.019]: 
  You just like...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:52:52.694 --> 0:52:53.993]: 
  He's great.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:53.554 --> 0:53:02.970]: 
  But then they're worried about you going on the internet and watching some fucking jackoff real slow It's like that's my face covered biscuit. Don't watch internet porn

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:59.950 --> 0:54:23.667]: 
  My biscuit. My covered biscuit, but don't watch internet porn. My dad was like, up until it was 17, he was like, you better not be watching what I think you're watching in there. It's like, fuck off. For me, 17. Soggy biscuit videos. For me, I was going to go to, I was talking about college with my crazy Christian aunt, and she's like, don't go to that. They're all gay. They all make you do gay hazing. And also, she went on a rant about how Pokemon is the devil. And she just had all these conspiracies. I saw that video. And my stepdad was writing in the back with her. And then when he got out, his face was so fucking red. And he was just like, don't listen to her. She's a fucking idiot. And we were walking into McDonald's. And then she started talking about all these conspiracies, like every conspiracy you've ever heard. She believes in the 240p reptilian quality faces. She was like bringing up the eye. The blinking eyes. The video compression. It's like aliens recording. She's bringing up these Windows movie maker videos from 2006. And she's like, I don't know what to say. To me, this is real evidence. And then my stepdad is just shaking his fucking head. Like, he doesn't know what to think. Why don't you just compress the video over and show her to her? Yeah, give it to her. Give her reptilian eyes. Like, have you ever looked at a fucking mirror? Yeah. You show her to her. You'd be like, look, you're one too. And she'd just jump off the bridge. But to summarize, oh no, I think if you're a good parent, you'll keep your kids from watching what you don't want them to watch. It's not up to us to do that. It's up to you, the parent, to do that. That's why, Zach. And on that, I'm going to go have diarrhea. I'll be right back. I'll keep you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:09.062 --> 0:53:10.041]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:29.455 --> 0:56:15.582]: 
  Pee fast, cause this poop's gonna leak out of my butt. Alright. Do you always have diarrhea? I don't. I just cooked a bunch of vegetables and I didn't eat rice with it and it was spicy vegetables. So that happens. You eat yours. Plus I drank too much. Oh yeah, that's right. Last night we drank. No wonder. I haven't hangover. I can't do shit. Yeah, it's such a waste of it. You're just gonna get water in your system? Yeah. Before you sleep, drink as much water as you can. That's something you taught me. Thanks, bro. Drink water after you drink a lot of alcohol. You guys can ask questions while I can work. Well, alright. What are you asking while you're reading? Captain Truth says, why is rice-pired mix such a bitch? There's a lot of reasons. Well, let's start from the beginning. He's worried about himself, I mean. I think one of the reasons is his dick is small and I think he kind of emits that constantly. Like every time you're around him, you just get this thing where he's like constantly letting you know he's a small dick and we're all totally fucking alpha males. So I like push out my chest. I show him I'm the top gorilla. Don't make a conjure with me. One time he did it, we fucking tell something. He got some teeth that came out, he got a black eye, but you know what? He fucking asked for it when he made that contact. It's so fucking weird. We were at a diner the other day and I was like, hey, can I have the Western omelet? And then because the waitress was standing there and then he was like, hey, I got a little dick. And I was like, why would you say that? No, I was thinking, you know. It's almost like he's proud of it. It's an internal thing I've read. Yeah, his dick is. You know what I'm saying? Totally internal. One time we went to a pussy bar. We went to a pussy bar. I got a steak. You know, I'm a fucking beef kick, as they say. He goes, oh, I'll get a salad. I'm like, hold on, hold on, he'll get a steak too. He's like, no, I want a salad. I'm a frail. I have a little picture. I'm like, hold on, hold on, bro. Listen, pussy babe. Look at this boy, a steak. He's one of me. He's a beef kick with me. She did it. Of course, he takes one bite and pukes. He's like, I'm one of the weak ones. I can't. All right, whatever. I take him into the parking lot. He's speaking that lung now. I take him into the parking lot. Oh, please.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:53.569 --> 0:54:54.109]: 
  Thanks, brother.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:55.493 --> 0:54:57.737]:

  June 8th, 05, time colon says, I take age, the industry side of creation is more than a little inviting. How do you guys keep your- Embittering! Embittering! Whatever! It's fucking nonsense. How do you guys keep your cynicism for becoming too harsh to remain humorous? He's basically asking, this industry is fucking- How does it keep you up a lot? Yeah, how does it keep you from being completely sick with them? Was this question specifically for Jeff or? I think it was for all of us.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:52.949 --> 0:59:53.438]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:55.328 --> 1:00:01.437]: 
  This question specifically for Jeff or for all of us. Yeah, you just could you have to have a little bit of

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:01.437 --> 1:00:49.328]: 
  You have to have you have to have a little bit of bitterness honestly like You can see when it's like when you can see when somebody comes like like straight out of college And they're going into business. They have no idea what the fuck they're talking about you can kind of read when someone doesn't get it You know, I think it's motivating dude. I think it's How do you keep her becoming so bitter by being motivated? Yeah, if you're gonna be cynical and you're gonna be bitter like how did that show get on television rather than You know, it is bitterness fucking turn it in all the tip. He'd be like, dude I could do better than that. Oh, don't focus on that and then do it. Yeah, all adult bitter This is to me is like a baby pounding. That's all it's like it's just pounding It's adult mature acceptable pounding for some reason. It's like question it at first and then you're like, oh, I know why that is

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:04.491 --> 1:00:06.364]: 
  You can see what's going on.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:16.253 --> 1:00:17.451]: 
  I think it's motivated.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:17.940 --> 1:00:18.514]: 
  Dude, I think it's...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:22.024 --> 1:00:24.488]: 
  motivated but that's another thing that's interesting

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:43.472 --> 1:00:43.590]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:00:46.139 --> 1:00:51.505]: 
  It's a fuck that, I don't like that. Unique couching. Oh you mean like how you sit around on the couch and hate on Seth MacFarlane?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:51.505 --> 1:01:47.378]: 
  That's not bitter that that's that's reasonable like like dislike There's plenty things that like He's like I got you know, but it is warranted sometimes like biatches. No, that's not the question though What what question is how do you keep them becoming better not what warrants being bitter? No, but it's like you say what what but all the same was sometimes it does warrant it But I never said it didn't heat the question said it wanted it I'm saying how do you keep from becoming over? How do you care? Do you keep from tipping a teeter? Yeah, that makes right? That's the only way I can see it like motivate yourself by it Yeah, no, no, I mean it I think if you can if you could notice the bad things that like in media entertainment That you don't like or the things that you don't like you could take that go okay I'm not gonna do that exactly But if you if you go if you stop if you take the second part out of that equation you just go this sucks This sucks it just it's a spiral it's a landslide and it's like noticing everything bad about everything Anybody can notice bad stuff. I anybody anybody can do that movies bomb in the theater. Yeah, anybody creative or not Yeah, and that's why any time like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:57.057 --> 1:00:58.154]: 
  for smile

 SPEAKER_04 [1:01:07.013 --> 1:01:07.755]: 
  No, but it's like...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:16.446 --> 1:01:17.087]: 
  Yeah, that was it.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:01:41.489 --> 1:01:42.940]: 
  Anybody can do it.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:42.940 --> 1:01:43.446]: 
  Guess why I moved.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:44.273 --> 1:01:52.255]: 
  Yeah, anybody creative or not. Yeah, and that's why anytime like Chris or something because Chris you're very critical about yeah But that's always my favorite question. No, but my favorite

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:49.403 --> 1:01:49.808]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:51.765 --> 1:04:01.872]: 
  Or my last critical stance. You were talking about how modern orchestral music all sounds the same. Because you asked me. Yeah, well whatever. Whether I ask it or not. I didn't say that either. I said I didn't like Hans Zimmer. Right, but what I like about it is that I can ask what it is that you don't like and then I can also ask what would need to change and what needs to be, what would make it better. And you're chock-full of- Yeah, no, it's the second part. If you don't have what can make it better, this is bad because of this, then you're just bitter. By the way, point to the reason this movie sucks because anybody can do that. But not a lot of people can go, I didn't like this, but here's the reason. Here's what could have made it better. Here's what could have made it interesting. I saw where they were going with it or I know why they made that. Yeah, yeah, exactly. But they shouldn't. Exactly. So it's like when I look at a show like Family Guy or like Stamper Bottom, Stamper Faro, and I'm not- I don't go, this shit sucks because of this and this and go, I don't like how they did this and this and here's what I would have done to make it better or here's what they would try to do or here's what they could have done to make it better. That's every online reviewer now. This sucks. You know, you do better and then they don't. They just make horrible shit. This sucks and okay, so what? What are you going to do? I don't even have to, you know, like a lot of comments, they're like, well this sucks and then the response is, oh, well you try to do better. I don't even think people need to do better. No, just say, just point it out. Yeah, say what you could do better. Right, be nice about it. So just say if I say something's bad, right, and if I go and I try and do it and I can't do it, then I respect it more and I'm like, okay. Right, exactly. It's easy. Like I said, I'll start, I'll only get redundant but- Not. It takes zero effort, zero skill, zero talent to be a critic. Yeah. It takes a lot of skill to be a critic and then apply that knowledge to making something better. And also, if you see a movie and like one little thing pisses you off and ruins the movie for you, like it happens to me sometimes where like one little thing will make me go, that was otherwise perfect, why is that thing there? Like there's so many people working on a movie, of course there's going to be little shit. I think also, it's also important to realize, my general rule is like, if nothing's perfect, I can't name one movie that I think is perfect, I can't name one song that I think is perfect, I can't name anything, I think it's 100% perfect. So I think there's also a level where it's like, if you just enjoyed it and you noticed flaws, then it's fine. I don't want to talk about two-way topical things, I just want to know real quick, what was one thing that you liked about Frozen?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:58.431 --> 1:01:58.566]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:52.650]: 
  This sucks! This is what you do about it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:53.376 --> 1:02]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:02 --> 1:02:54.895]: 
  This sucks.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:02:55.620 --> 1:02:55.924]: 
  So what?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:03.569 --> 1:03:03.940]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:03:03.940 --> 1:03:05.560]: 
  so much that you just pointed out.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:13.525 --> 1:03:14.250]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:14.250 --> 1:03:14.267]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [1:03:17.980 --> 1:03:19.009]: 
  There's a lot of things.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:55.662 --> 1:03:57.940]: 
  For me, for me it's different.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:57.940 --> 1:03:59.054]: 
  I just want to know real quick

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:02.192 --> 1:04:06.242]: 
  I thought it was very low-above. I love frozen. I thought it was visual.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:02.462 --> 1:04:14.612]: 
  I thought it was very well done. Okay, cool. I didn't want to go into it. I have a fucking laundry list of things I have wrong about phones and if you want to hear that, I'll tell you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:07.491 --> 1:04:07.896]: 
 おかえり

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:07.947 --> 1:04:08.132]: 
  Cool.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:08.487 --> 1:04:11.440]: 
  I didn't want to go in here.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:20.991]: 
  the things I have wrong about phones and if you want to hear that you are a grown man reviewing a movie for children for every man or adult.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:17.633 --> 1:04:41.072]: 
  Can I be mad? I don't want the adults. I just want to close my close thing. That's not cynicism. If you give me this point, I'd be like, that's a little girl's movie. You went to fucking Frozen, you came back and you're like, let me give you my honest opinion about a fucking movie for girls. About an Oscar-winning animated fucking movie that gets 65 million views and sells fucking millions of toys every five minutes. Shut your fucking mouth!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:20.991 --> 1:04:23.995]: 
  That's not cynicism.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:41.072 --> 1:04:47.265]: 
  The girls! No! You saw the trailer! You the fucking world! This isn't just for girls, motherf-

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:42.827 --> 1:04:43.890]: 
  You saw the train!

  It's just for girls motherfucker Fuck you the trailer is exactly like the movie you saw the trailer you Animated Oscar award-winning fucking movie for children for Fucking tell you something. Did you like tangled? Yeah, I loved it. You like tangled. Yeah, but I knew what I was getting into I was watching a movie when I talk to something if you saw tangled I like tangled and then I saw fucking frozen and I saw tangled as an award-winning movie And then I saw fucking frozen. Here's the difference if I here's the difference if I

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:54.218 --> 1:04:56.277]: 
  I'm disappointed! Let me fucking tie you! Really?!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:05.912 --> 1:05:06.216]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:08.022 --> 1:05:08.444]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:11.987 --> 1:05:12.578]: 
  Something!

 SPEAKER_04 [1:05:24.627 --> 1:05:25.437]: 
  I do!

 SPEAKER_04 [1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:38.059]: 
  I didn't like Tangled, I wouldn't sit at home fucking writing blog after blog, hating on it for years. I don't care! Because it's a fucking movie for girls! I'm telling you! I happen to like Tangled! I don't think anyone would.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:36.490 --> 1:05:44.505]: 
  I don't think anyone has ever asked the question, do you like Tangled with that much brain? Do you like Tangled?

 SPEAKER_04 [1:05:38.751 --> 1:05:39.764]: 
  It's your which whore.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:05:42.936 --> 1:05:46.227]: 
  Thank you!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:44.505 --> 1:05:48.994]: 
  Ice cream go maybe! Foil,이� normalmente!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:48.994 --> 1:06:16.230]: 
  Fuck you and capital letters. It is a movie for fucking children if you could still break a fucking movie down asshole I just told you why if I didn't like Tangled and I wouldn't go home and obsess over it for a fucking year You know why I'm talking tired of frozen because the fucking sequel is coming out and it's getting the same hype All right Like can I come fucking story that's a prime

 SPEAKER_04 [1:05:50.901 --> 1:05:53.196]: 
  It is a movie for fucking children if you-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:07.658 --> 1:06:11.539]: 
  Alright, alright. Okay, we're done with this one.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:14.408 --> 1:06:18.947]: 
  That's not a sentence! That's not a sentence!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:18.947 --> 1:06:55.887]: 
  You're just immediately like, oh it's a fucking little girls movie. Sinicism is a fucking poison. I'm critically looking at a fucking movie, okay? The first ten minutes of Tangled explains the fucking plot. Frozen does no such thing. The fucking next 45 minutes is a bunch of songs with this cooking cutter dumb bitch who wants to fall in love with an evil prince, ruined it for ya, and a fucking worthless character snowman that would just put in there- Don't talk bad about Olaf! Don't diss Olaf! The plot holds throughout this movie, and the truth- Don't have to be a little girl to fucking understand it. You can have no fucking brain cells, or you'll still see it. You'll be forced into it.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:06:25.124 --> 1:06:26.440]: 
  You're completely pooping out of it.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:06:44.260 --> 1:06:46.032]: 
 最接受我

 SPEAKER_04 [1:06:52.984 --> 1:06]: 
  Brainsail, the reel, the reel, the reel, what? Of course there's plot holes in it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06 --> 1:07:10.889]: 
  Man, look at what it is! You can't be critical about it! Okay, can I, can I read it? This is an award! Can I read it? Or an Oscar-winning animated thing that has done things that's never been said before. Can I, can I, can I read it? That's my fucking point!

 SPEAKER_04 [1:07:00.291 --> 1:07:01.439]: 
  Okay, can I can I can I

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:01.439 --> 1:07:02.130]: 
  This isn't a word.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:03.447 --> 1:07:03.970]: 
  Oh, it's-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:06.990 --> 1:07:07.395]: 
  I'll be

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:09.741 --> 1:07:14.449]: 
  That's my fucking point. Can I pick a little ground here so that you could try it?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:14.449 --> 1:07:59.050]: 
  I have two things. Don't be scared of me, please. No, I'm not. It was written by adults. That's adults doing bad writing. So that's, they're fairly curious as well. So I do agree with him. In a sense where it's like, if I watch like, Blue's Clues, I'm not gonna be like, this writing's awful. But I do think there's a middle ground where you walk in it and you go, okay, you lower your ball. No, that's, here's the thing. If Frozen wasn't this fucking critically acclaimed, like this movie, this expires so many things. It's such a creation. Zach, I can watch like old Disney movies that were in his first case, like it's still in June. This movie that came out in fucking like, like, September. I can still watch like, New York movies or Hutchback. Zach, this movie that came out in September, it won a fucking Oscar, like four months later. It's like, are you fucking kidding me? So Corey, when, when, when, when,

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:34.986 --> 1:07:36.775]: 
  No, that's, here's the thing, it froze it.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:07:43.170 --> 1:07:50.089]: 
  I can watch like old Disney movies that were in first case like still enjoy them. Do you like the movie? I can still watch like it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:57.464 --> 1:08:00.687]: 
  So Corey, when Frozen 2 comes out,

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:00.619 --> 1:08:35.348]: 
  I'm not gonna watch are we all going together no I hate you you're totally gonna watch I'm not gonna watch it no no it fucking if another set thing filing movie comes out guess what I'm not gonna watch you're not gonna watch 101 ways to die absolutely not I'm not watching it once I see a movie that fucking sucks like that and it generally upsets me that so many people defend it I'm not gonna see it again can I just say that frozen is a neat little adventure okay here's your it's fine if you like yeah sorry I'm talking about it was my fault I'm the question askers fault we go on

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:01.294 --> 1:08:02.948]: 
  Are we all going together? No!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:03.539 --> 1:08:05.918]: 
  You're totally gonna wash it. I'm not gonna wash it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:05.918 --> 1:08:06.593]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_04 [1:08:10.727 --> 1:08:10.744]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:12.702 --> 1:08:13.596]: 
  That's really nice.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:24.412 --> 1:08:28.952]: 
  That's all I see is. That's all I see is. No, it's always the question. It's fine if you're like...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:25.527 --> 1:08:25.999]: 
  Use...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:28.952 --> 1:08:29.948]: 
  Yeah, sorry.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:33.087 --> 1:08:33.104]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:35.314 --> 1:08:38.082]: 
  What, socialism? No, I was just calling it... Oh, it's KKK!

 SPEAKER_04 [1:08:37.002 --> 1:08:41.085]: 
  Can I please wrap this point up a bit? I'm not gonna say anything for the rest of the question.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:41.085 --> 1:10:02.440]: 
  I think, like I said, anybody can point out flaws. And I think the point is this. This is entertainment. If you could watch a movie and you notice flaws, anybody can, if you notice flaws, but you still enjoyed it, pointing out the flaws, well, you otherwise enjoyed it, is probably a little bit cynical. But if the flaws are what kept you from enjoying it, then pointing it out is very reasonable. But I can watch Breaking Bad or Really Good Show or Really Good Movie and notice flaws. But pointing those out might be nitpicking. I think that is the point. If you watch Back to the Future, go, no, this was, listen, listen, listen, this is again, of course, there's flaws. That's nitpicking, that's cynical, I think. Yeah. If you take that and you approve it, if you understand what flaws are, that's fine. But if those flaws prevented you from enjoying it, then it's very reasonable to prove it wrong. I went into the movie. That's all I wanted to say. I went in and I had high hopes. I didn't come in and I wasn't, I didn't have my fucking notebook ready. I wasn't a judge at a fucking, I don't know, American Idol thing. And I wasn't ready to write down my fucking long, I don't know, excerpt from why this movie fucking sucks. I went in because guess what? I like Disney. And I used to think that Disney had, like, they made movies for people. Tangled, I feel like you can watch, even if it's made for kids, I still feel like it's a movie you could watch with adults. And I still feel like we live in a time where even if it's made for kids, you should still understand that adults are cool kids. My only point is like, let's say you like action movies. Okay. You can't go to a Fast and the Furious movie, come home and rip it apart and say, there's too many fucking races and cars in it. It doesn't make any sense. But that's not what I'm mad. The movie sucks.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:19.020 --> 1:09:19.948]: 
  I went into the mall.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:09:19.999 --> 1:09:20.590]: 
  I don't know what to say.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:58.407 --> 1:09:59.166]: 
  But that's not what I'm saying.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:02.440 --> 1:10:07.452]: 
  He's not mad it's a little girl's movie, he's mad it's a fucking movie.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:04.482 --> 1:10:50.230]: 
  I'm not mad that it's a fucking movie. That's what I'm saying, but you know what you were getting into I didn't know! Well, it was always on the table. It could have been that way. What the fuck are you talking about? If you never watch this fucking like- I'm talking about the previous movie Then how the fuck can you make an opinion about it? No, I'm saying when people come back and they know what they were getting into I didn't know what I was getting into I was gonna get into a movie You didn't know you were going into a fucking musical movie I thought I was gonna go into a movie that had a good plot, interesting characters And it was written well Tangled is the same idea, but it was good Exactly! I still think Tangled is better than Frozen Tangled is really good Tangled is a hundred times better. If you want a fucking good movie to watch, it should have been a- I like Tangled a lot. We can end it on that. Also, side note, what was kind of fun with it

 SPEAKER_04 [1:10:07.452 --> 1:10:08.279]: 
  It's a movie that's so-

 SPEAKER_04 [1:10:13.257 --> 1:10:14.505]: 
  Well, it was always done.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:26.909 --> 1:10:28.647]: 
  I didn't know what I was getting into.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:36.392 --> 1:10:37.844]: 
  And it was written, though.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:39.025 --> 1:10:39.430]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:41.759 --> 1:10:42.670]: 
  The tackle's really good.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:45.859 --> 1:11:06.497]: 
  I like Tangled a lot. We can end it on that. Also, a side note, what was kind of fun was that the character design for the girl in Tangled, I believe, was recycled in Frozen. Yeah, like literally they just took the same character model and added in here. And Big Hero 6, the use of that girl. Yeah, Big Hero 6, the fucking launching. Alright, cool. What's the next question, Corey? Oh, sorry. Should it be Stanford now? Yeah, Stanford.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:54.060 --> 1:11:01.570]: 
  Yeah, like literally they just took the same character bottle and added hair. And Big Hero 6, they used the next drill. Yeah, Big Hero 6, they fucking launched it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:02.346 --> 1:11:17.213]: 
  What's the next question, Cory? Oh, sorry. Should we be stamper now? Yeah, stamper. Yeah, stamper. That one, 420, says... Nice lead, by the way. I spoke with YouTube, right? Really? I fucking... Hi, dude. I know what you're talking about with the 420 stuff. We'll get to that later. Can we talk about that in dubies?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:04.439 --> 1:11:05.940]: 
  Well, should we be stepping or should we be stepping?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:11.374 --> 1:11:11.442]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:11:11.442 --> 1:11:12.269]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_04 [1:11:15.137 --> 1:11:19.002]: 
  Can we talk about that? Smoking dubies! Can we talk about that? Can we hold up smoking weed?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:19.002 --> 1:11:20.993]: 
  I had no idea with what smoke.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:11:19.694 --> 1:11:25.887]: 
  I would hold up smoking weed

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:22.360 --> 1:11:23.339]: 
  I still don't know what it was for me.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:24.756 --> 1:12:23.262]: 
  Smoked weed dude! Smoked weed dude! For me it wasn't 420, the day where everyone smoked weed was 311. Because I was really into 311 and you know 311 is time to say. Was it the time that you smoked weed too? Yeah, everyone smoked weed. The day, like, isn't it like 420 at 420? Yeah, you fucking smoke that weed, Corey. You fucking light that joint up and get high. Is 420 only 420 p.m.? No, it's April 20th. Yeah, but you smoked it 420. That should have been a one-day though. If you told somebody who was like getting high at 420, like, dude you're actually supposed to get high at 420 a.m. He would have, his fucking brain would have been like... Dude, I've been hardcore smokers. I've been hardcore, they go at 420 a.m. and p.m. You know, if you fly around the world just before where the sun meets the end of the earth and you smoke, you could be smoking at a.m. and p.m. If you're an Australian, you can go back to the U.S. You could also smoke anytime you want.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:36.130 --> 1:11:36.180]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:38.037 --> 1:11:38.290]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:43.005 --> 1:13:02.547]:

  I didn't look up to a lot. This is two. I don't know, because I always kind of like to leave things as they are. And I feel like if I do meet people, like maybe it's kind of a soul or opinion of them. Because they're just people.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:13:12.942 --> 1:13:13.397]:

  Remember that thing you did remember that a cartoon you made?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:37.005 --> 1:14:07.718]:

I think I saw the thing you did. Yeah, cool. I think that's the only way to be cool. Yeah, the truth is you've watched their biographies. Oh god, you're obsessed with fucking maniac.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:31.819 --> 1:19:33.929]: 
  Stop injecting me.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:39.801 --> 1:19:41.438]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:48.762 --> 1:20:04.253]: 
  It's just like, even waiting that long. At the very center, they will have to actually dig into the steel for many years. It's just like a picture of how you draw girls, like these are the form hands. Or these guys. At the center of the cube, you will find a small, mummified girl dressed in snow white.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:49.487 --> 1:19:50.213]:

  Сист TS

 SPEAKER_04 [1:20:07.949 --> 1:20:07.982]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:09.569 --> 1:20:26.511]: 
  People twisted me. You have these like theorists who've been like in caves for years like trying to figure out what was in the cube the whole time. And so you have like those huge, the cube is also full of traps. Oh yeah, I feel like a huge pyramid had to have a little piece of paper in the middle that says LOL. I don't like mine anymore. Mine wasn't very creative.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:20:16.994 --> 1:20:20.318]: 
  You have like this huge cube is also full of traps

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:19.002 --> 1:20:20.183]: 
  I would do that too, I would do that.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:26.511 --> 1:20:28.722]: 
  Yeah, I don't even know what the fuck I do if I'm- President can't build-

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:27.861 --> 1:20:33.447]: 
  President can't build a cube in the center of New York. Yeah, he's the president. He can do it in a way. You know what I'm saying?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:31.793 --> 1:20:34.476]: 
  You don't know what I would do.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:33.447 --> 1:20:35.505]: 
  I would do and this is this is probably

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:35.505 --> 1:21:05.003]: 
  probably the most boring answer. So one of the biggest problems is that a lot of people that work for the government, they are supposed to be kind of servants of the state, of the people. And it's become this whole opposite thing where they are now at the top of the pyramid and they have their jobs set like tenure where they like stay, they can continue to have these jobs. So the one thing I would say is all people who work in the government have a limited run at their jobs. The other thing is, is I get rid of all

 SPEAKER_04 [1:20:45.124 --> 1:20:45.428]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:50.727 --> 1:20:51.773]: 
  their jobs and like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:05.003 --> 1:21:15.449]: 
  all of the golden parachutes. So all the rules that they set for everybody else, as far as healthcare, as far as retirement, as far as all of these fucking things, are the exact same rules that they set.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:21:15.449 --> 1:21:18.975]: 
  them and their families are gonna have to deal with when they get out of office.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:21:18.874 --> 1:21:20.460]: 
  Oh, so they don't get permanent help?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:21:20.224 --> 1:21:25.995]: 
  They don't get permanent healthcare, they don't get any of the shit, so when they make rules, they're making them with the...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:24.190 --> 1:21:25.118]: 
  Your big WebBlog!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:25.995 --> 1:21:36.087]: 
  idea that they're going to be out of a job in a few years and they're gonna have to join the normal Workforce and they're gonna have to follow the same fucking rules that they are setting for the rest of us

 SPEAKER_04 [1:21:35.361 --> 1:21:36.120]: 
  Why would I fall in love with you?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:21:35.496 --> 1:21:38.837]: 
  Why not our follow-up president that makes a bunch of far-jail cartoons?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:38.264 --> 1:21:42.094]: 
  Nick, Nick, why would you have a Chinese party president?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:21:39.597 --> 1:21:49.755]: 
  What if a Chinese party president? You're the president. You can like, you can like, create like the first ever dinosaur again and you just want to do good things? Yeah. Finally. Well, I don't want to be fair.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:48.203 --> 1:21:55.949]:

I've always had a really interesting idea for hell I think it's interesting it would be just like this because I think the idea like you if you burned if you If you burned it brimstone forever you get used to it But if it was exactly like except for there was like 10% more slightly annoying stuff Yeah, like you're you hit your foot like a door like a little bit more often Things like that where it's like life is slightly more annoying, but every time you start to adjust back right it would happen again That's exactly what I was gonna do. Yeah, yeah Because that sounds like an annoyance. Well, no because hell would every day though True hell like if you were in a dire situation for the rest of your life like boiling and hot oil or whatever the fuck It was you used to it. Yeah, so the true hell is a hell full of hope Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a way to escape it or that you you have you know, so what it's called current life Exactly Working on projects, but like you're never reaching your deadlines or like you're working on projects And you're almost done and then your file crashes and it's corrupted Like that happens like 10% No, and second you start adjusting back to stuff. It's like yours mine every time you want to reach something That would actually give you like something positive. It's always negative I guess the true hell though would be that you would in I or or it's good sometimes So it fools you like right right right well I was gonna say that it would almost be like you went to hell and you were tortured, but

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:00.452 --> 1:24:05.160]: 
  and you had no memory. So like you were constantly, it was always the first time and it was always,

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:05.110 --> 1:24:49.592]: 
  You understand a percentage of Twilight Zone where, I don't want to spoil it, but wait. Before we say that, that's technically like what it says in like, Oh does it? Like it actually says that when you go to hell and you burn forever, your flesh is reborn again with all senses, so you feel it over and over and over. So technically, hell is hell. You understand a percentage of Twilight Zone where the robber, like the thief, gets shot by police and he wakes up and he thinks he's in heaven? He asks the guy, the angel, whatever. Very end, turns out heaven was in him. No, no, no, no, because he's like, you know, he's like a criminal. He's like, you know, I want a gambling place and I want, I want, I want always win. I want women, I want money. And he gets all of it and he gets sick after a while. He's like, no, I want to lose. And then he's like, I want to go to the other place. And the guy's like, you are the other place. Right. He's in hell all along. You know, that reminds me a lot of- He gets everything he wants. Spoilers.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:11.674 --> 1:24:12.720]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:46.487 --> 1:24:52.292]: 
  You know that reminds me a lot of the one with the German the German colonel

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:51.685 --> 1:25:14.331]: 
  I love that it's got what is it called? It's like in season one. It's the you boat episode Yeah, and that one seemed like because he was I guess he was he's relieving it forever Yeah, but he was aware when he woke up a little bit. No, but he always starts off in that part Yeah, always with that exact same amount of type type in Twilight so this is to the audience type in Twilight Zone you boat German you boat. Yeah, no, that's not as well

 SPEAKER_04 [1:24:56.342 --> 1:24:56.359]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:56.393 --> 1:24:56.730]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:00.494 --> 1:25:00.780]: 
  Yeah, we can.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:02.451 --> 1:25:02.940]: 
  little bit.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:25:13.892 --> 1:25:14.145]: 
  non

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:13.926 --> 1:25:25.992]: 
  No, I think that would come up. Yeah. But that was a great episode. What was great about it though was that there was, it wasn't just that he was suffering from what he did, is that they put him in the seat of the other people. So he met the other people. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:25:15.630 --> 1:25:15.732]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:25:25.992 --> 1:25:29.063]: 
  So there was like a sense of compassion and empathy that you would never had.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:29.029 --> 1:25:32.826]: 
  Being on a submarine, watching missiles because he'd never met these people.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:25:32.421 --> 1:26:24.531]: 
  Yeah, that's a good episode. Yeah, no, it was cool. Out of those little daily annoyances, what do you think annoys you guys most? You? Fucking... I hate getting snagged on shit. Like, I'll be walking out of the bathroom, my belt will get snagged on the door handle. The only... I don't ever really get, like, furious that off. I would say, like, obviously, like, once every, like, three years I get furious. It's frustrating, you're trying to do all your own, you're always fucking up at. Like, one time I was trying to put the bench over my bed, and I get, like, three quarters on it, and the other time I was going to get the fourth one, and the other three quarters would come off. And I did it for, like, ten minutes, and I was like, gosh, I snapped because I was getting so fucking... Wait a shit, your bed, dumbass. I could do it, it was pissing me off. So things like that really annoy me. Let me tell you something. Just because I'm trying to shit where you can't get it right. My own personal hell is taking off a lady's pants. Guess what? It's blank. No pussy. A world without pussy. Oh wow. Right here. A world without pussy and weed. She can still pull you though. Oh yeah. Sam, that's dumb. She has a butt.

  She has no butt. She has no butt? No butt crack, it's just flat. No titties? It's like a canvas. It's like a Barbie doll. That's terrible. And you're like, what's happening?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:26:27.282 --> 1:26:28.885]: 
  She has no butt. No butt.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:31.180 --> 1:26:31.770]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:26:40.984 --> 1:26:41.001]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:41.001 --> 1:26:41.507]:

  different I'd be like she smacks your boner as hard as you can a little springboard

 SPEAKER_03 [1:26:46.232 --> 1:27:03.884]: 
  I would tell her I would still I'm gonna have to work with this put your like non-cracked Barbie ass on my face and fucking suffocate me So the next morning I wake up and experience the same thing. This would be beating off in the shower every night crying

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:48.797 --> 1:26:49.506]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:57.724 --> 1:26:57.741]:

You only told us Irish stories. Bullshit. No, I don't know if I told this you could just cut it out or whatever, but yeah, when I was like 12 or 13, I had a friend called Seth.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:28:41.134 --> 1:30:24.443]: 
  No! Seth Link-Farland, he was the one that was driving the boat. He was like, I drew a really funny character. You talked about it. We're not boat. We're not boat. This is the scariest story ever. Exactly. You're starting a gunning story again. It's not a really scary story, but it's pretty fucked up. It's pretty scary. Yeah, it's one of those real kind of scary stories where it really happened. I was like 12 when my friend said that we had this apartment complex that had a lake in the middle of it. It was like a pod, a lake, whatever. They kind of thought apartment complex wrapped around it. We went in the lake one time because it was like the summertime. We were just fucking around going in this lake. There was this tall grass, or this tall, not bamboo, but it was one of those things called... Reeds or... Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was in the shallow parts of it. We were kind of in the middle of this place. This old guy with the big fucking scary rock, or rottweiler, walked up and he was like, hey kids, what are you doing in there? We were like, just hanging out. He was like, yeah, what are you doing in there? Come to my place. You can dry off. We were like, no dude. He was like, no, come on over. We were like, no. He was like, no, no, no, come on out. You guys are going to catch a cold in there. Come on out. We made up some lie about that we threw a baseball in the lake and we were trying to find it, which was a true. We said it was a valuable baseball. This guy, we tried to go low and go behind the tall grass inside the lake and he kind of walked around and kind of prevented us from getting out. We were like, what the fuck? We were like, what are we going to do, man? Because he usually wouldn't leave us alone. We were like, we're fine, man. I leave you alone. He's like, no, come out. You got more and more persistent. And we were there for 45 minutes. Eventually we got some play where one of us was going to run out and escape and get for help. But luckily one of our other friends, the third friend who was much older came over and was like, hey, what are you guys doing? And that scared the guy immediately. He just walked up and got scared.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:28:46.045 --> 1:28:47.007]: 
  Talk about it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:28:47.007 --> 1:28:47.783]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:30:24.055 --> 1:30:31.784]:

 SPEAKER_04 [1:30:25.962 --> 1:30:27.126]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:30:31.345 --> 1:30:51.443]:

  That was a scary story.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:30:53.215 --> 1:31:24.957]: 
  That was a scary story and it happened so long ago. I don't have any details, but that was the gist of it. My story, I mean, it's from my childhood. I actually, a lot scarier things have happened, but I think because I was older, I was able to kind of navigate them with a little bit more. Caution? Yeah, caution and a little bit more confidence that I'd be able to deal with the situation. But the one that I remember that kind of left like a mark was also when I was a kid. I'm assuming a lot of these happened when you were a kid.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:30:59.897 --> 1:30:59.914]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:31:24.450 --> 1:31:26.442]: 
  I'm your kid. You got booked. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:31:25.615 --> 1:31:27.066]: 
  Yeah! You like work?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:31:27.066 --> 1:31:27.944]: 
  Dude.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:31:27.944 --> 1:31:38.018]: 
  man with a rat wallet in a lake. Wait hold on you were safe. I was safe. No what happened was is I was with my friends Nate and then his

 SPEAKER_02 [1:31:38.018 --> 1:31:41.950]: 
  sister Aaron, she's a little bit older than us and then Nate was my age.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:31:41.494 --> 1:31:46.506]: 
  and we were about seven years old and we had a sleepover and all three of us were at the house.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:31:46.506 --> 1:31:51.940]: 
  I forgot who mentioned it. It was nighttime and you know I was in a Chinese household so rule

 SPEAKER_03 [1:31:51.940 --> 1:32:04.917]: 
  were a little bit lax. It wasn't like it was like hey go to bed you know like they were just kind of like you know whatever. Anyways so um I don't know who like dared the other. I don't exactly remember how it happened but we decided that we were gonna go out.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:32:04.917 --> 1:32:09.945]: 
  to the bent tree. The bent tree is this tree that is near my friend Nate

 SPEAKER_03 [1:32:09.912 --> 1:32:19.311]: 
  place and during this period of time when we were in this neighborhood a lot of the neighborhood wasn't developed it was in Washington so it was just a lot of woods a very lumberie lumber town yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [1:32:19.041 --> 1:32:24.441]: 
  And so there's just woods everywhere, thus, Woodenville. And there was this bent tree, which is by his house.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:32:24.441 --> 1:32:34.971]: 
  and it was kind of like a landmark. We'd meet at the bent tree, we'd hang out there, one time Nate was up in the tree and tried to poop on me from the tree, and then wiped his butt with stinging nettle leaf, and then, you know, there was...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:32:34.971 --> 1:32:38.937]: 
  some fun stories about the Bentree too but so we went out it was late at night and we

 SPEAKER_03 [1:32:38.937 --> 1:32:47.948]: 
  We dared each other to go into the woods.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:32:47.948 --> 1:32:58.005]: 
  because we were with your friends. And then all of a sudden we heard a sound behind us and we weren't quite sure so we stopped and there was nothing. And then we kept going and it was fine. And we went deep.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:32:58.005 --> 1:33:02.444]: 
  deeper and deeper into the woods and then all of a sudden we definitely heard a sound.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:33:02.039 --> 1:33:34.945]: 
  Then we stopped and you could just hear like a foot going through ferns because it was woods You know what I mean like there's a bunch of trees trees leaves. Oh, yeah It wasn't like crunching dry leaves It was like you could hear like the brush Yeah, so we were like then what I just remember looking at them And it was so dark and there was a little bit of moonlight coming down through the trees But you could kind of see each other's faces a little bit But what you could really see was like the glint of light in the reflection of people's eyes So we're looking at each other in the dark our eyes are a little bit acclimated and I remember all three of us just looking each other

 SPEAKER_03 [1:33:08.316 --> 1:33:10.425]: 
  She tabbed me, told me, Hold She's Street.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:33:13.649 --> 1:33:15.201]: 
  for watching.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:33:34.945 --> 1:33:40.952]: 
  they're like what what do we do? So then we waited and we kept hearing it and it was getting closer and closer so we all fucking

 SPEAKER_02 [1:33:40.952 --> 1:33:50.267]: 
  and hit the deck and it was kind of like a dirt path that ran right up the middle of the woods. And when I say a path, I mean, it's like a foot wide. I mean, it wasn't really a path. It was like a bike path or a jogging path. It was either a path or a jogging path.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:33:48.563 --> 1:33:53.339]: 
  It was like a bike. It was either a bike or like, you know, water was running down it or something. Okay, okay.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:33:51.499 --> 1:34:08.442]: 
  was running down it or something. Okay, okay. It was right in the middle of the thing. So we're both on both sides of the ferns and we're lying down. I was with Nate and Aaron was on the other side and we just laid there for a while and we could hear the sound, right? Just like this coming closer and closer and then it stopped for a little bit and then we weren't sure what to do like whether or not we're going to do it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:34:08.442 --> 1:34:26.447]: 
  we should get up.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:34:22.431 --> 1:34:22.752]: 
  Bien mehr. Umрипre

 SPEAKER_02 [1:34:26.447 --> 1:34:34.497]: 
  And I'll get to the other question too, the thing that freaked me out when I was older. But anyways, so we're lying there and I remember staring right at Aaron's like I could just

 SPEAKER_03 [1:34:34.497 --> 1:34:46.697]: 
  see the glint in her eyes through the ferns right and all of a sudden a boot just went right in front of my fucking face and then kept going and I just remember seeing her eyes

 SPEAKER_02 [1:34:46.697 --> 1:34:51.439]: 
  Like in that moment. And I'm sure I look the exact same way. But like that will never leave my mind.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:34:51.439 --> 1:35:07.268]: 
  mind just like staring at her and we waited and we waited and we were just like locked eyes as long as we could and just waited and waited until finally we didn't hear it and then we all it was like we never said anything we weren't like one two three we just fucking I don't know if it's because one of us got up so everyone just got up and then we fucking

 SPEAKER_02 [1:35:07.268 --> 1:35:08.702]: 
  and ran back.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:35:08.702 --> 1:35:22.540]: 
  We ran back to the bent tree and I remember that there was a shovel next to the tree. It wasn't an axe or a machete, but there was a shovel by there. We went back to our house, we went into the, you know, back to the bunk bed and we didn't really talk about it, went to sleep.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:35:22.540 --> 1:35:25.037]: 
  Next morning we went back up.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:35:25.037 --> 1:35:32.952]: 
  shovel wasn't by the bent tree but you can see muddy footprints, like really big footprints that were there. So in retrospect, I think it's a good idea to go and see the whole thing.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:35:32.952 --> 1:35:36.445]: 
  There's a lot of things that it could have been. It could have been an adult that hurt.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:35:36.445 --> 1:36:08.997]: 
  kids out in the woods and was like what the you know why are they why do I why do I hear kids how far away were these woods from the house you were at? maybe I mean by the furthest we went probably like I don't know like a hundred yards 80 yards I mean it was a distance it was a distance and it was into the woods regardless yeah but the thing is that that always weirded me out when I thought back to it was if it was genuinely someone looking at a phone they would have said something yeah they would have been like hey kids is there somebody back here what are you kids doing out here it's late it would have been something but there wasn't that

 SPEAKER_02 [1:35:40.664 --> 1:35:41.676]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:36:08.997 --> 1:36:10.988]: 
  this dude was dead silent.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:36:10.988 --> 1:36:23.610]: 
  and clearly following us. And there's no way he didn't hear you. No, no, no, absolutely not. I mean, we walked straight up the same path we did. And he stopped too. Yeah. I mean, we were talking while we were like walking as well. So it wasn't like, we were clearly making noise.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:36:11.123 --> 1:36:11.325]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:36:16.118 --> 1:36:17.299]: 
  the same way we did.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:36:23.610 --> 1:36:28.994]: 
  As far as like an actual scariest moment that I felt like my heart kind of go

 SPEAKER_03 [1:36:28.994 --> 1:36:32.385]: 
  going crazy and left like an impression, that would be it. I mean, there's plenty of others.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:36:32.385 --> 1:36:33.449]: 
  of scary things almost getting

 SPEAKER_03 [1:36:33.449 --> 1:36:35.102]: 
  hit by cars or whatever but

 SPEAKER_02 [1:36:35.102 --> 1:36:38.055]: 
  That that's the one that definitely left him

 SPEAKER_03 [1:36:37.195 --> 1:36:37.937]: 
  left and right.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:36:38.055 --> 1:36:40.469]: 
  Damn. Chris, have you said?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:36:40.469 --> 1:36:41.987]: 
  Oh igual...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:36:41.987 --> 1:36:42.173]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:36:43.152 --> 1:38:53.916]: 
  I farted really hard and blood came out of my underwear. That is not scary. You said you like ran into tinkers that were like assholes. What was this? You said there was like tinkers who like shoved you down or something? That's probably not a lie to you. This sounds weird. What's a tinker? It's an Irish gypsy. Oh, OK. An Irish gypsy is like a scumbag. But the scariest thing I can recall is... Like snatch. Yeah, exactly like snatch. Exactly like snatch. But when I went home for Christmas this year, I was staying at my mom and dad's house. And one night my mom came home and she was like bawling her eyes out. And I was like, what the fuck happened? Oh god. Because like she's had a rough year and shit. So it was like someone probably fucking died. Like more than likely. Last thing she needed. Yeah, exactly right. So I was like fucking died. And she was like, I just saw a dog get hit by a car. And I was just like, oh, that's horrible. But it's not as bad as I thought. I like at least it's no one's dead. Yeah. But she's like, but I saw him like get hit. And then I saw him twitching. And I saw him like going, grrr. And like like spasming out and shit. And I was like, that's horrible mom. Sorry. And she's like, I don't know if anyone stopped to help him. And I was just like, oh, I don't want to make you go back and look at it. But maybe we should go back and see if it's OK. She said it was like close by. So she's like, I don't want to do that. I can't. I was like, just fucking park across the road and just close your eyes. And I'll go over and see if it's OK. Sure. She was like, OK. And then she. You brave boy. She pulled over on the side of the road, which was busy at the time because it was rush hour. And it was like pitch black. I got out of the car and her headlights were facing this dog. It was like just breathing. And it was lying there. And I was like, this is fucking shitty. But I went over to it. And I was alive. And I was like, oh, shit. I went over to it. And I was about to put my hand on it. And then a fucking black pit bull jumped out of the ditch. And it was just going, argh, argh, argh. And I was just like, oh, my fucking god. It's like frozen space with my hands out at it. Like, just remember, don't make any sudden movements back. Slowly as you can. It was just barking at me the whole time. I was just worried that my mom would see her son get her throat ripped out right before Christmas. That's all she fucking needed. Merry Christmas. Yeah, right? And I was just like back. And the dog was barking. I just like look over and see her in the car going like, And I was like, oh, shitting my absolute pants because Pipples are fucking scary. Chris, your story is a lot like the scary situation for me. Because the reason why I don't like big dogs is it actually happened to my sister. Wait, let me finish. OK, go ahead. Long story short, dog died at the end. OK, go. OK.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:36:43.169 --> 1:36:43.439]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_02 [1:36:46.493 --> 1:36:47.404]: 
  Not scary.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:36:54.880 --> 1:36:55.605]: 
  Yeah, probably.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:36:58.845 --> 1:36:58.862]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:37:30.959 --> 1:37:31.009]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:37:31.009 --> 1:37:31.026]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:38:42.492 --> 1:38:43.082]: 
  Gary.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:38:55.080 --> 1:40:21.582]: 
  Well, my sister actually like at a young youngest age she got bit by a dog like a dog like latched on to her and fucked up her arm Like when she was young Apparently the dog hat was like jealous because my dad would give attention to her and like he was obviously like he was nursing the dog So when the dog saw that he was giving affection because they can do that Yeah, no they do yeah And it got jealous and like bitter and then he like fucking kicked the dog and like put it down or whatever because of that because he Was taking care of it because he was gonna give it somebody's like this dog is not stable For me like after that I was always afraid of dogs and I was never really into a dog situation But this is this is almost crazy. I had heard that like at some point There was a there was an attack and a dog was free and I was like walking down a block and It was like one of these like huge like dogs I don't really know what kind of dog it was But it was right there and then it was like gnawing its teeth and I had come in close to it And I didn't know what the fuck to do in a situation like that I thought I was gonna be like maul because a person had already gotten his like arm ripped apart from the dog And I thought it was the same dog and it probably was so From there the first thing I did was I ran because like I mean what else am I gonna do just stand there and wait for the dog Just come around sniff me and then let me go. Yeah, so I ran and I jumped over Something and the dog jumped over something so it was still following me even though I had jumped over dogs

 SPEAKER_00 [1:40:13.330 --> 1:40:13.634]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:40:20.805 --> 1:40:29.462]: 
  Oh, dogs, the worst thing you can do is run away from a dog. It's natural instinct is to chase anything that's running away. Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:40:28.855 --> 1:41:32.440]: 
  Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, so it was chasing me until like um and then I ran into this other person's backyard and at this time I had like crazy adrenaline and I had set it up so when the dog had came in I Turned around and I grabbed the fence and I slammed it as hard as I could right when the dog came So the dog hit the fence and then I took that opportunity to run because the dog was like it hit its fucking nose And it was confused, but that was probably the scariest fucking situation. I've ever been in I can't really like vividly I've never really been in a truly like terrifying situation like that except like that like I thought I was going to die in Stanford Do you have any? um, I was trying to think but uh there was there was one time that really that was just it was really just me and fucking stupidity When I was younger I was every weekend I used to race and What would you race? Just um, you know fucking broken fast in the furious style And we used to be really into you know like tuning up our cars and shit like that I wasn't sure if it was like some kind of like back alley Sprint race where you're like you all got your shorts on

 SPEAKER_02 [1:41:32.440 --> 1:41:34.161]: 
  You're like, yeah, it's cool.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:41:33.351 --> 1:43:36.994]: 
  Mario Kurtz. No, yeah, this is back when, yeah, I was more than familiar with the back of a police car, but there's this one time, right after we were done racing, I guess we weren't done yet. So you start with like 100 people, and then eventually you do the cops break you up, and then you split into like 50, and then you get broken up again, you split into like 25. And then the end of the night came around, and we were still kind of like, we still wanted to fuck around. And there's a guy there, he's like, let's do one last race. And I was like, all right, so I wanted to like really go for it. And my friend Bob was in the car, and we took off. It was kind of like we're going to do the race and just wave each other and then go our own ways, like whatever. And then there was an off ramp that actually went up into a bridge, into an overhang. And we whipped around the corner, and he beat me, but I was really frustrated, and it had rained earlier. So when he whipped around the corner, I just kept going straight, and I flew off a bridge. And it was so weird because it was that everything went silent, and like Bob went silent, and there was like no noise anymore. I was convinced that we were going to die, because we fell so high, I could have landed from so high, I could have landed on top of a McDonald's, that's how high I felt. And what was really fucked up is when I landed, I landed in the middle of a four or six lane highway right in the middle of it, and I just spun down it for fucking forever. And if it wasn't three o'clock in the morning, I would have landed on traffic and carried everybody. And you definitely were directly in the line of traffic. Yeah, that was awful. That's how fucking stupid a reckless I was. And when I landed, I shattered my axles and all my rims, my car was fucking destroyed. Thankfully I landed flat like that. Yeah, instead of going forward. Oh yeah, and then fucking like rolling like a domino. Yeah. Were you wearing seatbelts? I'm pretty sure I was wearing a seatbelt. I had to have been because it's so fucking jarred. It is interesting like in those moments.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:43:11.564 --> 1:43:13.352]: 
  And care for the rest of the week.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:43:26.380 --> 1:43:27.949]: 
  Yeah. It's sort of going forward.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:43:27.949 --> 1:43:28.455]: 
  And then

 SPEAKER_00 [1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:30.953]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:43:33.484 --> 1:43:34.007]: 
  Ja, du...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:43:33.552 --> 1:43:40.437]: 
  I had to have been because it's so fucking jar. It is interesting like in those moments though, when like, cause I almost hit a car once too and it was,

 SPEAKER_03 [1:43:40.437 --> 1:43:48.942]: 
  What happened was is we were going down the freeway and it was very icy, but you could just tell. Like the two people in front of me, we're all going in the...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:43:48.942 --> 1:43:53.295]: 
  maybe like 50 miles an hour on the freeway because it was icy so everyone's going slow but

 SPEAKER_03 [1:43:53.262 --> 1:43:56.940]: 
  You could see like one of the cars are just not quite with it. They were going for it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:43:56.940 --> 1:44:00.434]: 
  back and forth just a little bit and then clearly they tried to

 SPEAKER_03 [1:44:00.434 --> 1:44:05.952]: 
  overcompensate or something and you can see it was almost slow motion they went wide and then they came right back in

 SPEAKER_02 [1:44:05.952 --> 1:44:12.702]: 
  and they T-Bone the car right in front of me. Yeah. And then I had to drive, you know, there's some choices you make. If you put on the emergency brake, there's a good chance.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:44:12.702 --> 1:44:17.494]: 
  you're gonna spin out and run into it yet. So I just I just waited as we're going.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:13.799]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:44:17.494 --> 1:44:21.021]: 
  And it all happened within a matter of seconds. I mean, we're going 50 miles an hour.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:44:21.021 --> 1:44:26.370]: 
  not a hundred but it's still fast enough and these cars, these cars By the time your reaction kicks in it's already too late.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:44:23.485 --> 1:44:24.801]: 
  You're by the time your reaction

 SPEAKER_02 [1:44:23.502 --> 1:44:23.620]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:44:24.801 --> 1:44:25.392]: 
  kick ten

 SPEAKER_02 [1:44:26.134 --> 1:44:36.445]: 
  And so as soon as I saw that, the only thing I could think was, as soon as he t-boned him, he started backing up and I was like, please clear this, please clear this. Because when he hit him, he went back a little bit and so there was

 SPEAKER_03 [1:44:36.445 --> 1:44:44.005]: 
  was just a little gap and I just went straight. You were straight, you sped through it. Right through it. No, I didn't speed through it. I literally at the same pace without tapping on the break.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:44:39.179 --> 1:44:39.297]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:44:44.005 --> 1:44:50.940]: 
  just went whoop right through that did you but in that moment it was dead silence yeah hard there was no like oh shit

 SPEAKER_03 [1:44:45.591 --> 1:44:45.962]: 
  Did you?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:44:50.940 --> 1:45:03.951]: 
  you just oh fuck dude just movies get it right it's just yep and it's just like dump pump yeah and nobody says anything because every you're in your head you're in that moment you're just like that's that's holding your breath and you're just

 SPEAKER_02 [1:44:57.437 --> 1:44:58.889]: 
  and nobody says anything.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:45:01.842 --> 1:45:10.499]: 
  That's that's supporting your breath here. You're not gonna say it as soon as you pass through it. You're like

 SPEAKER_04 [1:45:07.326 --> 1:45:08.440]: 
 囉···

 SPEAKER_03 [1:45:09.992 --> 1:45:14.245]: 
  Yeah. Did you stop after you went off the thing? Did that not supposed to do?

 SPEAKER_04 [1:45:14.245 --> 1:45:15.814]: 
  Oh, after I did that, well...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:45:15.814 --> 1:45:41.920]: 
  What not sense into me was like after all my friends were like fucking we were like really reckless every last one of my friends Totaled their cars and it was like weird There's like this thing that happened where we just we thought we were cursed because my friend mark totaled his car He totaled it and then um the next weekend or the weekend after that mark was in the Car with my friend John. Yeah, and we just installed the short shifter and then John totaled his car with Mark and this is like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:45:41.093 --> 1:45:44.839]: 
  This is like the PG-13 version of race. Yeah, I guess

 SPEAKER_03 [1:45:43.860 --> 1:46:30.925]: 
  Yeah, I guess. And then after John totaled his car, he was in the car with Aaron. And then we were following Aaron, I get around the bend and he, he barrel rolled down the road. And the first thing I saw was him crawling out of their back window through glass. Geez. So it was just a cycle of whoever lost their car last was in the car that got. And I was like, fuck that, I'm moving to Florida. For, I guess if we're talking about like car things, because I was in like a car situation like that, but I've never actually been in a situation where it's like I was like, I'm going to die. But maybe I was, I would. Yeah, I was convinced that we were going to fucking die. As a matter of fact, after we hit and we came to stop, I was just kind of rolling off to the side of the road and we just sat there for like 30 minutes. We didn't say fucking any.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:46:28.005 --> 1:46:29.423]: 
  30 minutes if we didn't

 SPEAKER_02 [1:46:30.503 --> 1:46:39.953]: 
  It was um that was your final destination. No, we we a fucking ladder is gonna drop off of a fucking building Firescape and crush your head

 SPEAKER_03 [1:46:39.734 --> 1:47:38.357]: 
  I remember he was like, stop the fucking car. And I was like, dude, I'm not doing anything. I don't know what's wrong, but we're just rolling. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. So we had just went to Hardys in order to like a big, like we have like these like huge like sandwich burgers with like fries and stuff and we were eating it. And he was, it was snowing out obviously. And there was no cars because it's snowing and we needed to get to a destination. So we were like, I guess we're gonna eat Hardys first before we get there. I think it was like a Contra, Risposco, and we slept on the black ice and like when your car's like losing control in the road, it's the scariest fucking thing. And the car was spinning and it's funny too because you know in movies, whenever it's like slow motion, we're shit, but we were holding the burgers and the fucking like shit was flying everywhere, like hitting the windows, like ketchup and mustard was splashing on everything. And when it was all over, the whole, the fucking car just smelled like Hardys and it was just like, yeah, it was just like ketchup. Yeah, Hardys is good.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:46:48.492 --> 1:46:48.542]: 
  So, that's it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:47:34.662 --> 1:47:41.462]: 
  It smells yummy. Yeah, it's just like kitchen lettuce. I'm at a Hardee's in a lunch. Yeah, Hardee's is good. It's also called Carl's Jr., right? Yeah. That's the other name for it. Yeah, they know.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:47:40.484 --> 1:47:43.369]: 
  for it. They used to have good ass milkshakes there.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:47:43.369 --> 1:47:44.500]: 
  Yeah, their whole motto is like...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:47:44.500 --> 1:49:35.183]: 
  like if the burger isn't messy, it's not a good burger or something. What's funny too is there's like one friend I had, Andrew, and anytime I rode in his car, I swear we crashed like three fucking times when I rode in a car with him. And he thought it was me. Like he thought he's like, you fucking jinxed me. Because the first time we got- He's driving! I know, the first time we got in a car, we went to Sam's Club and he was pulling out of Sam's Club and he hit a car. And that was the first time. It was like, it was a light hit. The second time, we went to this place that was like this old like 80s diner that was abandoned and we were driving around drunk and he was like, I'm gonna order some food. And he fucking pulled up and he hit a fucking street light and we went up the fucking street light, the cords and shit, and it was like this whiplash of blue and green colors. Then all the fucking lights in the entire neighborhood went out and we were like, oh holy shit. And then he pulled the car in and he parked it and he looked like he had just seen a ghost and he went to the house and then the cops pulled up and immediately knew it was him for some reason. So after that, he was like terrified. He's like, you're a fucking jinx. He's like, you causing a crash car. And I'm like, dude, the first time was this bitch that wasn't even paying attention. The second time was you trying to order food at three in the morning at a place that didn't have a fucking drive-through. So it's like, don't say shit to me. And then we got in an accident again. But this time, he was completely parked. This is where it's really funny. He was talking about how I was a fucking jinx. And he's like, anytime I'm in a car with you, we get hit and I swear to fucking God, like five minutes later, a car nicked the back of his car while he was driving and he fucking like spanned out. So he got hit while he was telling me that I'm a fucking jinx until like getting in a car accident. So he got like three times. So he was right basically. You are fucking jinx.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:49:32.753 --> 1:49:40.937]: 
  So you was right basically, you are fucking crazy. Don't ever drive in my car about that. Stamper and I almost fucking died the other day, but I tried to laugh it off, but it was...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:49:40.937 --> 1:49:45.494]: 
  was pretty close call that we were just driving down to the intersection and I forgot there was a there was a

 SPEAKER_02 [1:49:45.494 --> 1:49:51.535]: 
  a stoplight there and I was about to keep going but it was a red light and Stanford's like whoa there's a red light

 SPEAKER_03 [1:49:51.535 --> 1:49:56.445]: 
  And I went about three feet over the actual crosswalk and then a fucking bust just went

 SPEAKER_02 [1:49:56.445 --> 1:49:58.437]: 
  Right by the front of the car.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:49:58.437 --> 1:50:06.942]: 
  Yeah. Sector, what time I pulled you out from underneath the train? You wanna tell me what really happened Chris? You fucking weirdo. What? What's up?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:50:06.942 --> 1:50:09.439]: 
  Is this like the lake monster that's trying to rape you?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:50:08.376 --> 1:50:08.697]: 
  That's good.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:50:08.697 --> 1:50:10.739]: 
  We're the only ones underneath the bus.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:50:09.439 --> 1:50:21.336]: 
  I had to eat the bus. This is what happened. Me and Zach were at a convention and he walked down to the road and I grabbed him with my big monkey arm and threw him onto the sidewalk and a train went by and almost killed him.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:50:20.577 --> 1:50:25.420]: 
  He's really happy. I was, Chris was walking and someone was walking. I was walking. I've been playing crashing through the road, but what do you want?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:50:22.703 --> 1:50:34.752]: 
  I was walking on the road and Chris was walking and I started walking and he said get up the train tracks and I said oh I got up and like fuck 10 seconds Not true, I grabbed you, I did pull you up

 SPEAKER_02 [1:50:31.242 --> 1:50:39.494]:

 SPEAKER_03 [2:01:04.493 --> 2:01:15.006]: 
  or going backwards on a escalator. In London, they have those really long escalators. So he'd go down and up one, just stupid shit like that. So we ended up daring each other back.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:01:15.006 --> 2:01:18.449]: 
  and forth to do things and it got to the point where we would dare each

 SPEAKER_03 [2:01:18.449 --> 2:01:23.494]: 
  other for like beers or food or whatever. So we were at the subway and we were already drunk.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:01:23.494 --> 2:01:28.202]:

  and then jump right back out. That was the whole thing. That was what I was supposed to do. You're a faggot dude. But I was wearing, and I was doing it for a beer. So I was wearing a Birkenstock at the time, and it's in the summer, and shit was all fucking sick.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:01:57.447 --> 2:02:01.446]: 
  You're a faggot, dude. And I was doing it for a beer.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:02:05.952 --> 2:02:08.500]: 
  slippery and stuff. Now I don't know if you know what

 SPEAKER_02 [2:02:08.500 --> 2:02:13.950]: 
  what the New York subways are like, some of you guys do, but especially like in between the train

 SPEAKER_03 [2:02:13.950 --> 2:02:22.202]: 
  tracks, there's like these big garbage puddles, like this gooey fucking shit with garbage in it, whatever. So I jump down...

 SPEAKER_02 [2:02:22.540 --> 2:02:31.450]: 
  I slip because I'm wearing my Birkenstocks, roll my ankle, fall completely between both the tracks, my back, like I've literally

 SPEAKER_03 [2:02:31.450 --> 2:02:34.994]: 
  got this goop all the like halfway up my body and I'm lying

 SPEAKER_02 [2:02:34.994 --> 2:02:55.311]: 
  there and was fucking like stunned. Now my head is in a position where I can actually look back and it's not like the train was like 10 feet away from my head but it was I was looking up the track so I could actually see the train was coming and I'm lying on my back with a rolled ankle both hands on the tracks and I'm sitting there and I could just hear Mabby like dude the fuck

 SPEAKER_03 [2:02:50.924 --> 2:02:50.940]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [2:02:51.599 --> 2:02:52.139]:

 SPEAKER_04 [2:02:55.311 --> 2:02:55.952]: 
  Fuck it!

 SPEAKER_03 [2:02:55.952 --> 2:03]: 
  Get up here everybody on the platform is this like three in the morning There's a lot of people there and they're all fucking like oh my god Is he okay? Is he okay? And I try to like get up and I'm like hobbling up. I've got my body like halfway up the platform I was assuming I could just jump right out, but my ankle

 SPEAKER_02 [2:03 --> 2:03:22.092]: 
  was fucking busted so I'm sitting there trying to get like one leg up all these people reach down their hands They help me up everyone's so concerned the moment I get

 SPEAKER_03 [2:03:22.092 --> 2:03:36.452]: 
  on the platform. First of all, the cop didn't see any of this. Thank fucking God. But the moment I get on the platform, everyone goes from, oh my god, you, K2, literally several people saying, fuck you, you fucking idiot. I guess some people actually saw what happened.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:03:36.452 --> 2:03:39.507]: 
  shit people are just like scolding me I smell a dirt

 SPEAKER_03 [2:03:39.507 --> 2:03:45.835]: 
  dirty fucking subway garbage. I rolled my ankle, which by the time we walked back to the house was like ballooning up.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:03:45.835 --> 2:04:01.140]: 
  The girl that was there actually dumped me about three days after she went back to Washington. I'm assuming that was one of the main reasons. I never got that beer that night. He ended up coming later because he had to bring me crutches and stuff. You should have stayed on the tracks. I should have fucking ended it all right then.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:03:56.449 --> 2:03:58.947]: 
  bring me crutches and stuff and we drink up on the trip.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:04:00.432 --> 2:04:10.439]: 
  But that was like one of the dumbest things I've ever done and I've rethought a lot of like dares and shit ever since I mean besides doing too many drugs and drinking too much, but

 SPEAKER_02 [2:04:10.439 --> 2:04:15.754]: 
  As far as dares and putting my life in danger, I've kind of done with that now. That's good. Yeah.

  Yeah. All right. Yeah, thank you. What time is it, dude? One more question. One more. One more question. Here we go. This is from T87. I think this is a softball. This is a lob. I think we can handle this one. Okay. If Sleepy Cabin was a band, what genre would it be and what instruments would everyone play? Triangle. What? Triangle. You can't handle a triangle. You can't handle that. Hold on. What's the genre? Sausage. If we were to actually be like, guys, seriously, fuck all the podcasts, fuck all the animation, fuck everything, we're going to be a band. It would be a video game rock band. I think it would be moody, gothic, symphonic. You know what? Everyone disagrees. This band didn't do it at all. It would be rocked.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:04:20.817 --> 2:04:20.834]:

 SPEAKER_03 [2:05:06.919 --> 2:05:30.139]:
