  At first

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:56.216 --> 0:02:58.950]: 
  At first, I thought you said chemo.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:58.950 --> 0:03:11.472]: 
  No, like the- Keep it up, we're doing this. What always happens when you go- When I go on a diet is the first like week is like so fucking hard and then you get so used to it instantly and then it's the second you eat like one piece of candy is when it all falls apart.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:00.621 --> 0:03:03.051]: 
  What always happens when you go, when I go on a diet is...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:11.472 --> 0:03:32.954]: 
  Well dude, that's like a thing like when I was doing like push-ups like you know I did like I said a hundred push-ups for like 15 minutes a day Yeah, in case I felt like I was sitting down for a while I do like 15 push-ups and I had a lot of energy but my stomach had shrunk but over time I was just saying man I'm fucking lazy and so I stopped actually Being like productive for my body and I started like you know

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:19.015 --> 0:03:19.386]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:32.920 --> 0:03:38.961]: 
  Wait, so you said I'm lazy and then you stopped working up because you said you were lazy? Man lazy in the work sense, right? Yeah. But it's like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:37.375 --> 0:03:51.111]: 
  Yeah. But it's like when people who starve themselves, like your body goes into this situation where it starts needing food because it thinks it's going to starve again, it doesn't want to shut down, so that's why it starts like burning stuff and like, you know. So it needs more.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:51.111 --> 0:04:35.610]: 
  I've never been one person, the type of person to, you know, follow these crazy schemes. That's not a scheme, that works. That's your body, your body's not... No, not that, but I mean, there's always a thing with fat diet. No, but keto definitely works though. It's a fat diet though. You know what? I'm not saying it doesn't work, I'm saying it's a fat diet, there's always something there. Don't say that keto is a fat diet because you're pretty much like not helping people by doing that. Chemotherapy is bad. Keto therapy is for cancer. There you go. I've got the skin texture of a moldy wall. That's disgusting. You just set out in the sun, Chris. There's nothing to do with the sun. I got Irish skin. Chris always looks like he was in the pool for 10 hours. I walk outside and stay in the sun for four days. The sun bounces off me and hits other people. I can't stay in the fucking...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:55.785 --> 0:03:57.996]: 
  That's not a scheme that works. That's your body.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:01.405 --> 0:04:02.451]: 
  Makino definitely

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:02.502 --> 0:04:03.953]: 
  It's a fat diet though.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:03.953 --> 0:04:05.269]: 
  You know what?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:07.277 --> 0:04:10.551]: 
  There's always there's something don't say a key don't like is a bad guy because

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:13.774 --> 0:04:16.002]: 
  I'm doing that because chemotherapy is bad.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:25.992 --> 0:04:28.067]: 
  I got Irish skin

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:29.721 --> 0:04:30.312]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:34.227 --> 0:04:39.002]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:39.002 --> 0:04:48.435]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:53.667 --> 0:05:07.791]: 
  Man, it's been over 20 for me easily. Yeah, but I might... If you're gonna do it, just go to an apartment complex pool or something, but even those are kinda gross. I can't imagine even... I'm imagining just kid piss like you have my eyes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:56.789 --> 0:04:57.227]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:06.947 --> 0:05:16.262]: 
  Exactly, exactly. Like swimming in a pool with like dirty kids who take that as an opportunity to shower just to like, you know...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:12.060 --> 0:05:12.347]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:16.262 --> 0:05:51.953]: 
  What about like a hotel pool like a hotel hot tub a hot tub? What about a hot tub that burns away all the hot tub? No, he's a hot tub. The only hot tub I was ever in was like a family members hot tub, which you know, I sort of bared but I think hot tubs are more disgusting because they're almost like a more of a breeding ground for bacteria Really burning away the germs because it's like hot water. I don't know. I guess they chlorinate it even more than a pool But well, that's good. It's less bacteria than I'm at very many It gets all I think it gets all I think what I read is it gets all foamy on top. That's dead skin cells So if you see foam

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:21.696 --> 0:05:23.637]: 
  No appease of hot tub.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:29.054 --> 0:05:30.302]:

  Oh, he's eating his food. Now I no longer want to go in a fucking hot tub because of you, thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:55.463 --> 0:06:37.784]: 
  Don't like yeah, just man. I'd rather just swim the oceans disgusting in itself, but I'd rather pick the ocean Oh, no, no, no, no, no ocean. I will say fucking that the ocean is the grossest We're doing good with Christmas five years old. He went to the ocean. There was a big scrap person grabbing his legs Oh, yeah, that's true. You should go down to like Dominican Republic. The water is super clear No, I don't care because it's connected to the rest of the ocean Not people that's what even if you people that animals even if you watch even if it's dead animals Oh, what do you mean?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:58.373 --> 0:07:07.064]: 
  My biggest, I'm not too worried about that, but I would never swim in certain kind of lakes or ever go to a lake. I would never swim in a lake. Don't swim in a lake.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:04.532 --> 0:07:14.472]: 
  I would never swim in a lake. Don't swim in a still body water. Why not? Because that's where it fucking makes you. Yeah, that's where it's hard to get there. You don't wanna.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:08.110 --> 0:07:19.872]: 
  Why not? Because that's where fucking bacteria is. That's where the lake is. You don't want to... Have you looked at the fucking rings of the lake? There's like urine bubbles and condoms and shit. Actually, it all meets...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:18.235 --> 0:07:33.456]: 
  Condoms and actually all meets at the end. I did swim in a lake in Lake Okeboji when I was younger and we got out I was covered in like spoils and shit. It was like these parasites to dig in your skin. Exactly. Yeah, but however You know what the oceans full of? You know what you shouldn't add. The oceans full of shit

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:28.056 --> 0:07:29.558]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:10.395 --> 0:08:15.070]: 
  Sharks actually are incredibly afraid of humans.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:14.597 --> 0:08:16.184]: 
  When it is clear, it's nice.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:15.947 --> 0:08:26.174]: 
  Like that's something that like I never knew growing up where it's like I always thought shark attacks were common But sharks are actually terrified of humans the only time there'd be a shark attack is if you attract them with blood or like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:26.224 --> 0:08:33.008]: 
  Sharks are like they only go after humans to think you're a seal or whatever A seal? And everyone says that you have more of a chance of being struck by lightning

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:29.987 --> 0:08:30.477]: 
  See you all next time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:33.008 --> 0:08:39.943]: 
  Yeah, it's crazy. So go out, find a shark, and fucking beat it to death and see what happens. Fucking put your brains in the head for the two of you. I like sharks.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:38.408 --> 0:09:25.776]: 
  I like sharks. Can we suck with the beach for a second? Sharks are dark. The beach, like, okay. But they are cool. One thing I will say, a nice beach breeze and the sound of the ocean, very nice. A nice beach breeze. I've been to the Jersey Shore many times. Okay, that does not count. This Jersey Shore is gross. It is a little gross. But, uh, my biggest complaint. But that's what I was gonna say. The beach is kinda shitty too, cause you go to the beach, you get back in the car, it was like, don't get sent in the car, and you're like, well, fuck you, it's impossible. Like, you always step on gross shells and there's little civilizations up in those two. My biggest complaint. And there's crab shit. Sorry to go there, Jeff. Little tiny strings of crab shit all down the beach. Crab shit. There's no crab shit. There is crab shit. Little strings of crab shit. That's human shit. That's not. There's no crabs. There's barely any crabs on the shore.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:41.361 --> 0:08:42.794]: 
  Took a second to make a joke

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:53.055 --> 0:08:54.473]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:16.157 --> 0:09:18.857]: 
  There's no crap shit. There is crap shit.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:20.444 --> 0:09:22.064]: 
  That's human shit. That's not.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:22.064 --> 0:09:22.080]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:23.009 --> 0:09:31.024]: 
  I've seen crabs on the shoreline. I've seen crabs shit like rats. You guys have nothing to waste. I've seen crabs shit like rats when they stir into their holes.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:27.430 --> 0:09:27.784]: 
  I've seen it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:31.024 --> 0:09:42.634]: 
  There's horses, crabs. There's horses, crabs. Tribes get propelled by their ship and spray shit under us and skid across the sand. That's where they work so hard. It sucks. The hot sand sucks. Stepping on shells sucks. That's what I was gonna say. That's what I was... Hot sand is the worst.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:39.951 --> 0:09:49.114]: 
  That's what I was gonna say, that's what I was gonna say. Hot sand is the worst. Hot sand is the fucking worst. When you go to the beach, you would have to walk in the shade in some weird mismatch pattern so you don't burn your gun. Oh, whatever it is.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:48.254 --> 0:09:53.704]: 
  We're going with this hot concrete to get off the hot stage. Oh, God, that's the worst. Even if you wear sandals.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:51.325 --> 0:09:57.299]: 
  Oh, that's the worst. Even when you wear sandals and you step into the sand, you're getting those shards of hot rocks. The only thing I hated about it

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:56.404 --> 0:10:33.495]: 
  The only thing I hated when I was a kid, my family, they would pack a bunch of shit for the day. Like, they'd get a cooler and pack full soda and granola bars. And then they'd just put up an umbrella and they'd sit there for like six hours. And it was just, that was kind of boring. And then you had to think of walking back and just saying... I just swam the whole time. But yeah, but like the ocean smells like shit and there's seaweed. You need to go to a nice beach for one time. Which would like beach with nice beaches? It is nice. Rassler is a nice beach. They shot Save in Private Rhino. You go down in the Dominican Republic, there's the Topos Beach, which I was at, which I didn't even know was in the topos.

  I never really understood that type of porn words. Sorry, go ahead. No, it's just for girls. I never got lesbian to some degree. I like it, but I never got the degree where it was like, what's the point? Because with most porn, I think to some degree, with porn, you kind of put yourself in the guy's shoes just a little bit. You can't argue that with lesbian porn. You're just like, what's with the creepy molester? If two lesbians walked in here right now and got down on the table, sir, do 69. What can I do? I just sit here. No, but I'd be really horny looking at it. What did I do? I just sit here at the bathroom. I'm looking at a big, sexy buff, hairless dude fucking girl. Yeah, but you're like, oh, that's my dick. You know, you squint a little bit. Yeah, you like the porn that's a video that's like 27 minutes long of just the one angle of penetration. Like, right up the girl. I hate that back of the ass. The balls? The balls. What? And it's like half an hour long. It's sick of me because a lot of the time, the guys don't shave, so you just see this big ass flush. I want to see the girl's ass flush. And you know what really, really pisses me off when you're watching a porn and the girl's not anyway? Because it's like, wow, I'm watching the girl being raped pretty much. It's great. Yeah, get bearded to me. Or when they're like doing overbores, like, yeah, fuck me. And you're just like, this is fucking gross. I saw a video where a guy was having sex with a girl and she started laughing and I was like, fuck you bitch. And that's so angry. I was like, you're gonna laugh? He's having sex with a girl. I would get hornier to that if anything. No, she was laughing like, oh, is that like, it wasn't like a sexy hornier that was like, ha ha, look at you, you fucking loser. And I felt so insecure. I was like, oh, I closed the item. Do you like it when the guy shoots his load in her mouth and then she looks like she's like eating, she's enjoying it like it's like a treat? I prefer the mouth rather than the face because every time I see the face, it's like, oh, close your eyes, close your nose, close your ears. It makes me want to vomit. She's like, mm, mm.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:43.992 --> 0:19:45.173]:

  For me, like, I know you guys say you have porn stars and stuff, but I'm an amateur. I don't like amateurs. I really go on my way to watch porn stars. I know a few of the games I see around. I don't know a single one.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:41.601 --> 0:23:07.200]: 
  I'm an amateur. You guys like amateurs. I don't like to see you. I really go on my way to watch porn stars. I know a few of the ages I see in my room. I don't know a single one. I can't tell you what porn star, Corey. Me neither. I can tell you like three. I do. Because when I watch porn, it's all amateur. Say it again for me. I'm speaking of porn. Bucky Larson born to be a porn star. It's a great movie. Jeff, you saw this movie. I did. Recently. Based on Corey's recommendation that it was one of the worst movies ever I watched.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:50.528 --> 0:22:54.747]: 
  Me neither. I can tell you like three. I do it. Because when I watch porn, it's all your image.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:01.446 --> 0:23:02.492]: 
  I did, I...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:02.492 --> 0:23:02.948]: 
 P

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:07.200 --> 0:23:15.385]: 
  Ah, which doesn't pale in consideration to the other worst so we ever made Clue's the egg this year ago

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:15.317 --> 0:24:35.035]: 
  The angriest have ever gotten- If I'm- if I- if I don't animate well that day on when I'm working on, I- I wanna- I drive home and I- I'm slamming in the gas pedal and I'm trying to not to swerve into a telephone pole. What would- what would fuck you to yell at somebody? Like a random person that you don't know very well? If- if there's a really antagonistic, like, drunk person, that- that really makes me mad. Oh, hey man, what's up? What's going on? If somebody's really fucking around and they're drunk, like, not friendly drunk, I mean, like, either like an angry drunk or somebody's- somebody's trying to like pick a fight. Oh, yeah. That pisses me off. I- I- I can knock somebody out doing that. The worst thing about that is, is like, some people can be the nicest people and they're sober, but when they get drunk, they turn into fucking monsters like that. Alright Chris, I get it. No, I know. That's what I'm saying. Chris, that's the most pissed off I've ever was of you. What? What type of drunk? Just because- You piss me off so much. I'm usually a nice drunk. I know, like eight percent of the time. Just because I threatened to swing an axe into somebody's face, like, I have too much to drink. Fuck it. Sorry. Yeah, I'm- I swear to God, just like, that was the only time I got drunk and I was an asshole. Chris, let me explain. Chris got drunk with Time, a couple years ago, and he kept hitting me in the testicles. That's the closest I've ever come to punching him about, that you were really irritating me.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:38.149 --> 0:23:38.605]: 
  Man.

  Sorry.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:35.659 --> 0:25:18.876]: 
  It was funny how many times it did it. It did it like twice. I was gonna piss off. Oh, wait. Let's guess. Let's guess why. Let's all guess why. It was Chris angry. Because I was... Let me guess. You saw a kid crab, huh? No. You saw a kid crab. I would not get mad at fish, but it was because my mom was... He was over in Dark Souls. No, actually, wait. I got mad. Why should I have to think about that? Because I got mad a few times at Dark. I'm really mad at... Okay, I broke up PlayStation controller over Dark Souls. Oh, you're kidding me? The Madness... I was playing... No, I was having a horrible day, right? And I put on the second game. And then there was a part where I was finally about to beat a boss or whatever after the fiftieth time. And then the controller died and I just smashed it off the floor.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:35.997 --> 0:24:37.937]: 
  There was so many times that he did it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:50.020 --> 0:24:51.015]: 
  No, stop, it's good.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:50.307 --> 0:24:50.442]:

  I was-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:18.437 --> 0:25:21.407]: 
  The madness I've gotten is probably when I've played games.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:20.901 --> 0:25:51.580]:

  Amazing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:50.061 --> 0:26:00.372]: 
  Shit, everything else. Mac laptops are garbage. That's true. I bought a 2,000. I spent $2,000. You can not true. Mac laptops are garbage. I spent $2,000 on a MacBook Pro.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:53.436 --> 0:25:55.765]: 
  2,000, I spent 2,000!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:57.840 --> 0:28:12.689]: 
  I spent $2,000 on a Mac for- Cause they're fucking bloated! Get close to me. They're bloated! And a Windows machine is not bloated? Uh, not like a Mac laptop. Macs don't come with fucking- What do you call it? Like all that software preloaded on the desktop. They don't come with fucking- What, and this- Cut and paste either! I still don't know how to cut and paste on a God dang Mac. You gotta like copy it and then delete the old files. So fucking stupid. I've been using Macs for years. Macs are just- They're designed to be just 90 bit different. In the worst ways. Mac desktop. It's just not so many people. It's just the guys that constantly broken Windows computers. What else? Here's my fucking story. I spent $2,000 on a fucking Mac book for- $2,000. $2,000. Yeah, how much? I had it for a year. You know something, Jeff? You know what I did? I used Facebook, Skype, and maybe something else. Maybe Flash once in a while. After two years of crash, four times. Listen to me. I used it for nothing. I used this fucking bloated piece, overpriced piece of shit for nothing. I used the internet. You couldn't use it for more stuff. But I didn't. Here it is. This is his fault. This is his point. For absolutely no reason. It stopped working. It crashed completely. I had Mike Welsh. We'll go get it fixed. I had Mike Welsh. I'm not going to blow hundreds of dollars. I had Mike Welsh reset and fixed it again. Everything was white for no reason. I didn't touch this piece of shit. Then I did it two more times. And the third time, he finally reset it again. And I was using Skype. And I was talking somewhere in Skype. And I was saying all that was on this computer was Internet Explorer. There was Safari and Skype. And I was typing something. I was saying hello. And I typed in hello. And it took five minutes to type the H, the E, the L, the L, the O. See what I did, Jeff? I took it against my knee. And I fucking pushed it slowly and broke it against the back of my leg. That desktop computer I have over there, that desktop computer I have, the HP, I bought three years ago for 200 bucks. I haven't loaded my shit. It's still working great. It's having analogies. When a woman is pregnant, she has a kid and he has Down syndrome. Are you condemning all humans to people who does not have kids anymore? You're saying my MacBook was a Down syndrome child? Yes. Yeah. No. Yes. I had a Mac. I had a big fucking... I had a big fucking... I used his Mac and I rolled the USO. So what you're saying?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:09.079 --> 0:26:09.737]: 
  It's all that soft.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:10.986 --> 0:26:12.960]: 
  I don't come with fucking cutting pasty

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:20.807 --> 0:26:22.005]: 
  Max or just...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:26.477 --> 0:26:30.342]: 
  It's not so many people. All right, just the guys

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:32.097 --> 0:26:32.940]: 
  Ah, that's true.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:40.112 --> 0:26:41.007]: 
  Yeah, how much?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:58.337 --> 0:26:58.354]: 
  Thanks for watching!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:59.519 --> 0:27:00.936]: 
  This is his fault.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:00.936 --> 0:27:03.282]: 
  This is the point.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:34.264 --> 0:27:34.551]: 
  That's good.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:48.996 --> 0:27:49.941]: 
  Shit.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:51.848 --> 0:27:54.194]: 
  crush yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:00.994 --> 0:28:02.715]: 
  You're saying my back...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:08.436 --> 0:28:08.993]: 
  Fuckin'

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:08.993 --> 0:28:22.493]: 
  I had a big fucker. So what you're saying is because you have a Downey kid that you should give extra care to him. Sometimes it happens. That's all I'm saying. Sometimes you should give extra care to him.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:16.114 --> 0:30:38.404]: 
  Sometimes it happens. That's all I'm saying. You should give extra care to your Downey kid. Every back practice, the Downey kid. You just got the regular kid. You're the anomaly. The normal kid is the outlier. Jeff, I gotta say, right, before I moved to America, right, I had to copy everything off my Mac onto a hard drive so I could bring everything to America, right? Do you want to hear it? I don't know what you're trying to convince me of. I've never had a problem. Listen, this should have been the easiest thing to do, right? All you do is you cut and you paste, right? Except not on a fucking Mac, right? I have to go to cut and paste all day. Listen to me. And it cuts and it paste. This is the problem, right? When you have a hard drive and you want to put something from a Mac onto a PC, PCs use different format. They use like fucking fat or whatever, or Mac uses something. I think it's, they use two different things, right? They used to. A long time ago they were different down-putters. You have to buy a hard drive that says, I go into a PC and a Mac. I'm cool, right? I got one of those. I put it into the Mac. I try to copy shit onto it. And then halfway through this big, long fucking conversion, it says, no, sorry. And I'm like, where did my files stop copying? Do I have to start all this again? And then I found out that Mac's just, it was... What? The hard drive had a fucking emulator built into it to help it copy shit on, but I just couldn't handle it. That was the power PC processor, Chris. The power processor. They moved over to Intel processors years ago. I had to use those pieces of shit. That was a legitimate problem, but it's all sorted out. It is not sorted out. This happened like two weeks ago. I don't know what you're talking about. That was the closest I came to something recently. I gave it to my sister. I think the biggest thing it pisses you up about Mac is that they do little things. They make little changes to make it feel like it's different, but it's just more tedious. It's like, oh, computer, control C, copy. Mac is like, hold, fucking bend your fingers, expand your hands. It's command... Command Apple fucking C, control C, two buttons. Right, it's command C to copy, command V to paste. I'm a Mac. All my USB drives are in the back of the fucking screen. What the fuck is with that? I got to fucking hunch over my fucking computer every time I wanted to plug in a memory stick. In the back of your stupid screens. You see what I got on my desk? A little fucking... a little memory... a little USB stick. The slot is in the back of the thing, because it's like, oh, we fancy. We can't plug it in the side. It looks too stupid. They care about aesthetics. Who cares about aesthetics? I want some of the worst good.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:28.484 --> 0:28:30.002]: 
  Beauty and the Beast

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:30.002 --> 0:28:30.509]: 
  Yep

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:40.060 --> 0:28:43.097]: 
  I don't know what you're trying to convince me of. I've never had a problem.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:50.725 --> 0:28:51.450]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:52.784 --> 0:28:53.779]: 
  Listen to me.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:07.077 --> 0:29:09.591]: 
  long time ago they were different sponsors

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:37.789 --> 0:29:39.747]: 
  Yes, I have to be else too.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:41.940 --> 0:29:47.408]: 
  I had to use those pieces of shit That was a legitimate problem but It's all sorted out

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:49.720 --> 0:29:51.036]: 
  I don't know what you're talking about.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:53.230 --> 0:29:55.339]: 
  I think it's my sister.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:10.004 --> 0:30:13.986]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:03.278 --> 0:31:06.569]: 
  I'm sorry, but you should get a Linux computer.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:04.493 --> 0:31:12.120]: 
  I'm gonna get a Linux computer. Linux is PC and Mac. No, it's a double conversion. You could have two of the same worlds.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:08.526 --> 0:31:09.150]: 
  No, it's...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:12.120 --> 0:31:18.634]: 
  My dream is what it is. Linux is better than PC and Mac. We can play games now.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:24.792 --> 0:33:29.129]: 
  Alright, enough talking about MaxPC and the best friend of them all, is it?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:28.082 --> 0:33:31.339]: 
  Let's just call it a stalemate and...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:31.339 --> 0:33:36.435]: 
  Let's just admit that Linux is useless and nobody fucking uses it except for hackers. You're gonna get hacked so often.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:35.490 --> 0:33:41.869]: 
  There's like one listener out there that's really mad. No, last time, my teacher.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:38.747 --> 0:33:47.168]: 
  No, last time my teacher showed us how to install Linux and then it's like don't worry no one uses it

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:46.088 --> 0:33:51.370]: 
  You don't need to use a command line anymore. You can use like the user interface

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:51.370 --> 0:33:55.200]: 
  I actually have no idea what a Linux is, but it has a stupid friggin' penguin on it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:54.644 --> 0:33:57.597]: 
  It's based on Unix.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:57.597 --> 0:33:58.491]: 
  I don't know what that is.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:58.491 --> 0:36:26.434]: 
  It's it's I guess it's like it's a little girls unix system from Jurassic Park. Yeah, I don't really know either man I'm just I'm just what's a little media that animates. I just need flash and Photoshop, and I don't really care Itunes sinking to my phone. Itunes makes me sick Jeff. I want to drag and drop it. It's free here We go. That's all the kid ever wanted. There's no problem with itunes. Yes, sir He's there's a lot of problems Steve Jobs was not a nice guy Alex you want to talk about Bill Gates? Steve Jobs was a questionable human, but he was motivated He thought like his whole cancer thing that it was basically his fault. Yeah He wouldn't get a cure. I don't know how much of that is absolutely true But it does sound like he wasn't listening. We could clarify that's right I don't suck a fucking asshole Steve Jobs died of cancer He had some kind of organ failure, but then Aston Kutcher decided to live off the Steve Jobs diet, and then he got sick Really? Yeah, Aston Kutcher You know about that when he was making that Steve Jobs movie that biopic He decided to go on this like Steve Jobs diet of like just eating apples all day or something It was something I'm sorry, but I'll get this exactly right But it was basically like this fruit diet and he put himself in the hospital But what happens like in 2001 or two they're like Steve Jobs you realize you have early forms of pancreatic cancer, right? He was like, yeah, like we can get a surgery to remove this and he was like, you know what all rub true shrubs on it and stuff It's fine Steve Jobs I think I think early in his life you got this he was this weirdly spiritual guy We're just like eating at Buddhist temples or I'm getting this all wrong. I think by the way There's something weird going on where I think he just felt he could heal himself through natural means And he was wrong and paid with his life. Yeah, then don't don't crucify me. I'm saying is I'm not gonna crash Android phones You should use an Android I just don't care And that's a they're kind of like, you know targeted for viruses and shit Yeah, I never had a virus on my Mac eat that. That's true Did you hear about when people are going to the Olympics in Russia the second they got off the plane all their phones were getting hacked by like nearby like towers and shit I did not hear about that. Yeah, I phones. No, well, I think it was mostly Android because I don't know why I like you never really hear of like iPhones are like Mac's getting viruses or hack or whatever. I mean, I guess it kind of it can happen kind of but yeah But not really you don't have a bunch of old people clicking on exe files. Yeah, plagues

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:59.841 --> 0:34:00.702]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:07.643 --> 0:37:08.200]: 
  No, there was

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:09.432 --> 0:37:32.500]:

It was just like rock next to a fucking hamster breathing cage There's an animal where it looks like a rock and you could open it as pink on the inside Hey, what an animal anyways, it's a rock and you fucking cut it Yeah, it's got like blood and shit. I don't know what you're talking about. That's a lie rock a source

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:21.987 --> 0:37:26.442]: 
  Anyways, Mr. Rock, can you fucking cut it in half with a hand? Is that your question? Fuck, what?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:25.935 --> 0:37:27.015]: 
  and it's in its gut.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:31.184 --> 0:37:36.246]: 
  Rock a sword to answer your question

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:34.440 --> 0:38:06.233]: 
  You know what Seth Vick Barlin was gonna remake the Flintstones? Or he was gonna make his own series of it? Of course he was gonna bring back the world's funniest sitcom about Stone Age people. Who is passionate about the Flintstones? Seth Vick Barlin, that's who. He was! I mean, it's an open show for the time. But who dreams about, aw man, I gotta bring back the Flintstones. It was really funny though, they cut their grass with dinosaurs. They washed their dishes with dinosaurs. Yeah, they ran around with their cars. They even opened their mail and saw a little dinosaur inside. They surfed down the surf down the dinosaur stack.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:39.064 --> 0:37:40.718]: 
  She was gonna bring back the world's

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:45.494 --> 0:37:45.865]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:45.865 --> 0:37:47.940]: 
  I mean, it's an open-air show.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:47.940 --> 0:37:48.852]: 
  over the time.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:56.732 --> 0:37:58.217]: 
  WaldeウUND, todos eles vêm, véi!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:59.635 --> 0:38:01.322]: 
  Yeah, they ran around the other car.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:04.377 --> 0:38:10.739]: 
  I didn't grow up with the Flintstones and Jetsons so when I watched that I was like, it's boring, but I thought Jetsons was better.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:10.587 --> 0:38:38.802]: 
  Are they gonna put feathers on the dinosaurs? Oh, are they gonna do that for the Jurassic World? No. Or did they say they're not gonna do that? The director was very anti-feather. Very anti-feather. Feathers are stupid, dude. No, they don't! What? There are some cool renderings of dinosaurs with feathers. I saw the team, the big white T-Rex with the feathers. The people who do it right, they look like... They really are the... Not the descendants, the opposite of like birds. They... Ancestors. Ancestors are birds.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:19.935 --> 0:38:20.492]: 
  Very..

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:20.492 --> 0:38:21.387]:

  People peed out, Cory got, Cory knew a word I didn't.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:43.189 --> 0:38:45.079]: 
  I can't believe I remembered that.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:45.045 --> 0:39:04.283]: 
  When somebody renders a dinosaur like a velociraptor with feathers correctly, it looks cool. It looks like it should. Well, I guess like even if it didn't, it would still be like a breath pressure or whatever. I think it would look cool. Yeah, let's see if we can see the same old T-Rex design that was 20, 30 years ago. Everyone just rips off the new-dinosaur.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:57.449 --> 0:38:58.208]: 
  I'm going to see you.

Yeah Oh my god, I don't know how they got so big. I don't think they were so big They weren't that big on land. Why'd you still get why they evolved to be that big?

  There's actually evidence of evolution in practically everything.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41 --> 0:41:51.447]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:00.919 --> 0:45:02.303]: 
  I was so fucking worried.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:03.214 --> 0:45:03.872]: 
  How's it going to be?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:15.060 --> 0:45:47.005]: 
  I've never been a car person. My friend, uh, Andrew, he was obsessed with cars back in the day. He would be like, man, I got a 1040S GS, fucking volume 10, made that up, mixer car battery alpha omega, and I'm like, cool dude. You know what? I remember he was talking, and he used to be so adamant because he, he could tell you 100 reasons why Ford sucks and why Chevrolet's better, and then he'd be like, do you agree, Corey? I'd be like, what? I literally know nothing about cars. I don't understand engines. I don't understand anything.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:47.005 --> 0:45:50.498]: 
  I don't. I don't. I don't. You choose the purpose of the car is to go

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:47.714 --> 0:45:49.502]: 
  I don't. You look nice. You do look pretty.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:50.498 --> 0:46:03.846]: 
  You know for point A to point B. I remember we went car shopping for a car and I'm like, oh that car looks nice, the car is garbage, and he opened up the engine and he was talking for 20 minutes. And I'm like, yeah, but it has black seats and he looked at me like I was an idiot. I think, I think.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:03.795 --> 0:46:21.987]: 
  I think, I'll say, my dad is a bit of a car aficionado and I have appreciation for older classic cars. I'm not a fan of newer cars really, but cars from like the 50s and 60s I'm a fan of. I just think they're like aesthetically pretty nice looking, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:21.936 --> 0:46:53.948]: 
  Cars can look nice, yeah, but to me it's like, I just, I don't even care if I just had a fucking like, white car, is there a brand like that? White car? A white car? Or a white car? You could get a Kia. That's a brand, I'll have a white car. That's about as, that's pretty much what I want. If I went to a fucking car retailer, where the guys at like fast fucking are here. They would take a video of you so bad. Dude, it's so weird. He'd be like, I'd be like, okay, why should I get this car? He'd be like, listen to this baby purr, and he'd turn on the engine and it would fucking explode. And I'd be like, yeah, well, it's loud. I don't want to. Well, Corey, if you had a car.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:31.605 --> 0:46:37.326]: 
  You could get a Kia. That's a great car.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:31.656 --> 0:46:31.943]: 
  You can

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:33.951 --> 0:46:35.942]: 
  I have a white corn.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:40.127 --> 0:46:43.013]: 
  They would take you better if you were so bad at the word.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:52.497 --> 0:46:56.277]: 
  or if you had a car, it would be you to like them more.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:56.091 --> 0:47:09.270]: 
  Here's the thing, I had a car and I had my license, but this is another thing why I don't like driving. I'm not afraid to drive, I can learn the road and I can learn, I can be very, what's the thing, attentive?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:09.270 --> 0:47:10.519]: 
  Yeah, a tandem.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:10.317 --> 0:47:24.104]: 
  Yeah, attentive. I can be very attentive when I drive and pay attention. But it's the stupid fucking assholes that are not attentive that I'm afraid of. Like, I don't want to be driving in some fucking crazy motherfucker cuts in front of me and I have to react by stopping like that.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:22.770 --> 0:47:29.672]: 
  by stopping like assholes. The scariest thing to me is letting you like guide your own purposely assholes is accidents. Yeah, no. Accidents.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:28.238 --> 0:47:44.505]: 
  Yeah, no, that's the thing and it's like that to me is what scares me and that's why I couldn't drive because I remember I would have just like kind of small panic attacks when I drove and people would fucking swerve in front of me and be like You're gonna quit driving in the middle of the road and I'm like I'm parked

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:44.505 --> 0:47:53.449]: 
  It's just that happened to be a lot that happens to be a lot here in this area Especially if I go to the airport of the highway or something I wanted to at least three or four assholes who were he?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:53.449 --> 0:48:00.014]: 
  I'm fucking weaving it out of traffic. That's why I just can't. I'm afraid, I mean I'd like to drive, but I just, you know.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:59.946 --> 0:49:16.255]: 
  Yeah, there are there are adults are incredibly aggressive drivers that I really am not a fan of and then there's uh, there's people who just don't Understand there's some basic rules you should need to follow and they just feel they don't need to they people who don't use their turn signals Oh, I don't understand this no turn signal epidemic going on But it does help to know when you're turning, you know, they built it into the fucking car for a reason I thought it was illegal to not do it. It is kind of J-walking it's like, you know, they're doing in front of a cop Like that's really reinforced in our but it really fucks up things when you don't know that you're expecting the person to turn in an Intersection and then they don't yeah, and you're either waiting for them or you go or you decide to go straight And then they start to turn into you my dad actually flipped the van because the He's fucked the van. Yeah, my dad was driving his van behind a car and the person actually okay So the person used their turn signal turn right, but then they turn left and my dad fucking way He turned left and his van slipped on its side and it's skated along the floor damn my mom double That's a lot t-bomb by somebody and double flipped her car really yeah double flippin We should have a bit like a ragdoll in her brain I guess the one the firemen on the scene they they were expecting a carful of dead people, but

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:15.167 --> 0:48:16.770]: 
  That's the worst one.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:25.984 --> 0:48:26.153]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:28.566 --> 0:48:30.270]: 
  But

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:31.604 --> 0:48:34.236]: 
  You did it in front of a cop, you're asking for over.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:35.789 --> 0:48:36.362]: 
  but it really...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:42.134 --> 0:48:42.454]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:50.183 --> 0:48:50.267]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:09.674 --> 0:49:10.450]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:17.453 --> 0:51:55.133]: 
  My mom and her friend lived but man that was that was horrifying. I couldn't imagine that imagine so much I'm coming at you recently this dude flew through the stop sign and the funniest thing is when you know They're fucking lying. He wasn't paying attention and he told them he had a bug up his nose That's why he didn't see the stop sign. He had a bug up his nose Can I can I can I tell you my biggest my biggest fucking I want people to die? When I see you do this say there's a left way the right lane, right? Yeah, you're the left there So you're the right lane. Yeah, the left way both are straight. They both go straight, okay? The left lane up ahead you see you see very well way up ahead the left lane is being closed down So instead of getting in the right there's the lane they're supposed to get in they stand there wrongly purposely Oh, yeah, so they go all into the front and fucking cut it put their signal on and cut in I hate that Oh, yeah, so it's yes Oh, like basically take the lane that's closed that I know it's closed But go to the very end if it was closed and put their signal on a way to cut in there There's there's this one spot near the mall and yeah, it's basically two lanes And they stop at the intersection and within like ten feet across the intersection than the lanes merge Yeah, and if you're a decent fucking human being you're getting what you're supposed to get in the left lane Yeah, and you wait there and even if you're coming down the road You see a huge line and there's still nobody in the right lane You still get in the left lane because everybody has to stay in line to get through the intersection And get through the merging part, but these dickheads will like oh I'll just I'll just skip this whole line of 20 cars and they'll get in the right lane And then the you're basically they're forcing themselves to merge into the middle of this line of polite people I understand the order of things When I'm really see those people I make it a point like if somebody's tracking it Make it a point to like tailgate the guy in front of me so I can't let them and I fucking hate those people Oh, I like playing oh my favorite my favorite part is playing chicken with them when I'm in the right lane And these dickheads get in the other lane. I'm I will never submit to them. I exactly because I'm in a bigger car I'm just gonna I just look at them and I just keep going. I don't care if they run into the sidewalk That's why you're like fuck you smiley you you saw the thing you Purpose at the fall Pleasure from watching them slam on their brakes because I will not let them in if you want severe anxiety You know drive you should drive because that'll fucking give it to you. It'll make you hate people Oh, it does it makes you wish people you don't know would die honestly, and that's why I do like driving a lot But I don't drive. It's nice though when you're driving on like a nice day. Yeah, and leisurely drive. That's a nice It's a nice way I used to drive

  Bye.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:54.441 --> 0:52:05.680]: 
  I used to drive but it's those situations where you deal with fucking assholes that just ruin the experience entirely where you're just afraid you're gonna fucking break your car or die and not be able to pay for it. I know for fuck's sake.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:04.634 --> 0:53:48.921]: 
  It happens. I'm gonna get a really I'm gonna get a really unnerving. Don't don't live in fear guys Do you have road rage do you think would you would you say you get road rage? Sometimes I mean yeah, if somebody I don't do act. Yeah, it's somebody like oh you mother fucker I'm not the type that screams in my car. No, but there are you but you kind of talk to you like you mother fucker Do you talk to yourself like that? There's people pull. Yeah, I mean I don't like I'm like you fucking I get so bad I see shit people pull so it blows my mind these people who they will pass another they'll pass another car in the Like the parking lane It's like a lane where all these cars are parked with park meters and this dude will swerve into that lane in out real fast Right before I hit the rear-end in another car. That's all it's the weavers It's the weavers is these guys who go in out in out of the yeah, oh yeah They don't turn symbols They just quickly and very aggressively weave in and out of traffic and they basically save themselves about 15 seconds over the course of like three miles of reckless driving the weavers on the highway are the worst though because they're dangerous These guys who will cut in cut out cutting. It's like dude. You know signal. Oh god. That's fucking dangerous One thing I will never do is own a motorcycle like even yeah, I'm gonna drive like not an asshole on a motorcycle I am too I I've read about and I've seen too many motorcycle Accidents that ended up in death. So these guys who fucking explode pieces. Yeah, we pieces. Yeah, not even their fault It's just a car bumps into them and they just go fucking flying and you kill it So I don't know I'm too I'm too afraid to ever do that driving. What a hassle Jeff. Hi, you know what I mean? Isn't that relatable? Wow? Yeah, or drivers Cory you're a talented guy. What are you summary some of your inspirations?

  Do you have that?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:48.921 --> 0:53:52.802]: 
  Same fucking cookie cutter inspirations everyone else has.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:52.499 --> 0:53:52.684]: 
  Like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:53.427 --> 0:53:57.004]: 
  with the wacky cartoons, the spray colors, the 80s.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:57.004 --> 0:54:06.302]: 
  What are some cartoons you liked? That means you go, well, what we'll do is when you watch as a kid, we're like, well, I kind of want to do that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:06.302 --> 0:54:27.059]: 
  Oh well, I mean like, Ren and Stimpy, obviously. Rockets Modern Life, because I loved how unorganized everything was and how weird it looked. Mainly the design of Rockets Modern Life. I just loved the crazy chaotic it was. People will knock it till the fucking cows come home, but I love the Invaders' Zim style, how dirty it was and shit.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:27.059 --> 0:54:28.004]: 
  He's very duck.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:28.004 --> 0:54:39.563]: 
  Yeah, I guess that's generally it and then I guess animator wise definitely like Aaron because of how like his like color choices and his style.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:39.563 --> 0:54:40.491]: 
  Any comedic inspiration present for this video is shown in this

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:40.491 --> 0:54:42.415]: 
  Communic inspirations.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:42.314 --> 0:54:46.937]: 
  Who makes you giggle like no other? Who makes you laugh harder than anybody else?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:47.190 --> 0:54:56.455]: 
  I have to think about that one. Can we? No, Steve Brawl, you know, like... Steve Brawl, yeah. You see a lot of stuff from that, I showed you. John C. Riley is, I guess, the other one. Steve Brawl.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:56.455 --> 0:57:55.178]: 
  What are you Chris? Ah! Either visually or comedically. Every time someone asked me that I never know what to say because the only thing I can really say inspired me to do cartoons was just when I was younger I drew and then everyone was like yeah you're good at drawing and I was like okay I'll just keep doing it and then when I was like 13 started doing Flash and then all I really watched at that point was like South Park to the point where I can't even watch the new ones because it's so like it was so like it inspired me so much back in the day that all the new ones were nothing like it anymore so it just kind of weirds me out. I don't like when I was younger it's to be really into like action-y stuff but not really though like that's the thing I used to always like okay so I played with fucking toys until I was probably 12 or 13. I did too I was I was way later than that. I used to fucking like choreograph these crazy fight scenes in my head with toys and shit and that was I don't know it's like I never really watched Dragon Ball Z or anything as I recall when I was younger so nothing really inspired me in that regard I used to just love playing with toys. What inspires you now? Let me put it that way. What inspires you now? Games inspired me more than fucking games inspired me more than anything just the scenarios just the cool characters fucking I don't know like I used to love Resident Evil Final Fantasy 7 that's about it really. What is it about Final Fantasy 7 that you just takes you all over the world and you kind of feel it when you're doing it? Does it and if you feel like it was more successful at that than other Final Fantasy games? Yeah I think I yeah the fucking Final Fantasy I hate Final Fantasy dude I like Final Fantasy 7. Lost Odyssey. I played four which was good six was good but none of them really hit hit me as hard as seven and then eight was terrible nine was forgettable ten was horrible but like all in different ways like eight was just terrible story nine was just kind of forgettable to me. Did everyone like nine though? Yeah everyone likes nine and everyone likes ten but ten like gameplay is good but its story is just downright horrible it's like it makes you like sick to play it. Even though people will argue about the story at 12 I feel like that was my favorite just because of the combat. Yeah that's the thing like ten had really good combat but I'm so down with turn based. Yeah I don't want to play ten because it just has like terrible everything is in the game like the fucking the music's good but the characters are all fucking horribly unlikable fucking I didn't like 12 because it's just it's so like deserty and I don't really like deserty kind of settings usually. 12 was a really big diverse game I really loved. Oh man the characters in 12 you got it man they were terrible too. Oh yeah yeah I mean like the main character with his like little belly shirt God they're just trying to piss you off at this stage. But just the combat with the gambit system where you could kind of you could kind of program your other teammates to do stuff based on what you wanted I like that a lot I like the micromanagement. That's the thing like I'm saying like these games are horrible but all I'm really thinking about is the story and that's why I like seven so much is because the story kind of made me go Yeah well the stories are nothing compelling. Like seven's like combat isn't even that good or whatever it's just every time I think of them favorite games ever it's like fall five seven dark souls and because they're the ones that like fucking played forever and ever and ever.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:31.690 --> 0:55:33.192]: 
  Not really though.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:40.026 --> 0:55:40.110]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:48.092 --> 0:55:49.020]: 
  I never really

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:37.907 --> 0:56:38.599]: 
  to me and

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:58.849 --> 0:56:58.883]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:19.825 --> 0:57:20.348]: 
  All year.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:35.789 --> 0:57:35.805]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:45.070 --> 0:57:45.154]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:55.178 --> 0:58:36.522]: 
  Yeah, lost Odyssey first time I played less at Odyssey my brother's friend had the game And he was letting my brother borrow it and he was like oh, I don't like RPGs Yeah, and I saw it was like the first Xbox RPG I've ever seen in my life and that game has an amazing story It has amazing music and the fucking like they go to so many different places There's so much different shit going on it is turn-based But to a point where they try to change it up each time like you have your you know You have the defense in the front and strong people in the back, but sometimes the strong people get captured So you only have defense in the front so you have to start thinking strategically or they Mix match it and make situations. Well, it's just really smart the way it's played out

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:36.505 --> 0:58:41.618]: 
  I did buy that game. It's really good. I gave up early on it though. I'm not saying it's bad, but...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:41.365 --> 0:58:50.899]: 
  You have to play it as long as fuck though. It's like four CDs. So I mean you were dedicated about a weekend to it, but it's a damn good game.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:43.491 --> 0:58:45.314]: 
  Yeah, there's like four discs.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:49.988 --> 1:00:06.314]: 
  What are some of your comedic and or artistic inspirations? Jesus Christ. No, um, artistic, I think artistic more so than animated shows was probably games early on. I liked games were like a lot of Capcom games. Like, you know, like I think like a lot of artists Street Fighter 3 had some of the best 2D animation ever. I didn't even like Street Fighter at all. Like I like the characters and shit. But whenever I see people playing it, you just got to stand there and be like, fucking hell, that's amazing. I love Street Fighter. Yeah, like Street Fighter. Yeah, like unlike some of the 2D fighting games today, they're they're really, I feel like they're still animated really stiff and awkwardly. But Street Fighter 3 had all of the like tenants of animation and it had like squash and stretch. And it's really like the pinnacle of 2D games. Look at those 2D shows. Did you grow up watching or that inspiring now, Jeff? Well, I really liked Cheers. No, I used to watch. Jeff, I grew up with you though. Artistically games inspired me way more than. Yeah, I think that that was something I could just watch over and over and really like obsess over the details. I think one of the most beautiful 2D games is actually like Marvel vs. Capcom 1 before they before they started throwing in all these like she half-assed like 3D backgrounds. The whole thing was 2D and it was just perfect.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:19.992 --> 0:59:20.886]: 
  Enused vorige keer wel in het museum jongen, Heartmade Bis Black

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:44.545 --> 0:59:44.849]: 
  Cię pa!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:44.562 --> 0:59:44.579]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:03.968 --> 1:00:11.579]: 
  The whole thing was 2D and it was just perfect. I played Marvel vs Capcom playing like every day for a solid year. It was such a good game.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:11.579 --> 1:00:16.202]: 
  They nail the backgrounds, the characters, the inner things.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:15.730 --> 1:00:31.154]: 
  How fast like when you're fucking bouncing off the walls and knocking people in the air and they're doing like special moves and just It's just constant action And then like the levels have interactions like Mortal Kombat where you can fucking knock them through walls and shit to a completely different location

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:31.154 --> 1:01:12.784]: 
  Crazy it's weird. Yeah that and then for like humor wise I liked 80s action buddy I don't know like Beverly Hills cops Yeah, Beverly Hills cops is one of my favorite comedies ghostbusters isn't it just cuz the the die the humor came naturally I'm like I'm the only way to die in the West. Oh, I think that's what What I really admire about those kind of old cop not all but older comedies is that they really relied on just characters interacting That was the joke. Yeah, I mean like it was just too fun two characters who weren't funny guys Yeah, if you watch it really was the time the West it said it's supposed to be a funny guy Yeah, all those movies are really funny characters or just different characters who were they interact? That's funny That's just real real

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:38.967 --> 1:00:38.984]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:49.986 --> 1:00:50.965]: 
  too many was video

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:10.658 --> 1:01:16.176]: 
  That's what it comes to. I don't know if you could compare a million ways to die to the West to an actual good move.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:15.923 --> 1:01:17.695]: 
  with anything else that's remotely good.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:17.695 --> 1:01:19.737]: 
  Because it's not a good movie. Dude, Ted, fuck.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:19.079 --> 1:02:14.952]: 
  Dude, Ted fucking sucked balls too. Yeah. Ted was horrible. I really admire character comedy. It's so easy when you first start out to fall into like gag comedy. Yeah. What if this happens? You know, I'm probably doing a lot. Everybody is when you first start out. That's why it's so admirable. You guys have any of their favorite comedians? I've, Jeff, since you shouldn't be curbing with these guys, why I'm really, he's seriously one of my top five emotions, just because he's so goddamn funny. Yeah. And his writing, I think he's writing alone. He can, here's my favorite thing about him. When I see stuff now, like a comedy show, I go, OK, they show that thing so I know for a fact that thing. It's predictable. A lot of comedy shows are not predictable. OK, this country's going to do this, just going through the motions. But a few of you dudes, yeah, will have like five things in an episode. You're like, how the fuck are these all going to wrap together? And by the end of the episode, you're so sick of like failing to predict what's going to happen, you just kind of turn your brain off. Yeah. You sit there and enjoy it. You can see him put together like a little chihuahua, a fucking bagel and something else. And he all ties and ties and all that.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:21.711 --> 1:01:23.129]: 
  bit memory

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:08.826 --> 1:02:08.843]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:14.952 --> 1:02:26.680]: 
  Oh god, that episode, I lost my shit at the very end of that episode where it all started because that girl cut in front of him and wrote her name down and then got to the doctor first. Oh, yeah, the first. Because it's like the first way for sure.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:23.963 --> 1:03:13.289]: 
  Yeah, it's like the first way I feel like I relate to him so much. So we let just because he's obsessed with Small things like I could care less of an asteroid is headed towards earth or politics But like the scene where he's standing in the ice cream shop and some woman is taking She's taking way too many samples of ice cream like that would I would lose my fucking mind if I saw that and I totally get that There was one part it wasn't a group of these as but it was in clear history But there's a part of the way I go to a diner He's talking about the forks. Oh, yeah forks just on the table I always think that when I'm gonna go to a diner the forks are just on the bare table It's like a napkin always bothered me. I could always I could talk about dirty diner forks Yeah, they always have fucking dried egg on them. I'm so tired of dried eggs. Are you see spots?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:40.045 --> 1:02:40.652]: 
  I'm gonna steal.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:11.365 --> 1:03:39.225]: 
  Or you see spots or something like that. At diners, yeah. Well, you get those... There is that one time when you're ordering food and then they bring you a plate. Like, it happened that one time we were at Drake's and they fucking... The plate had like, spaghetti and shit on it. That does happen. It's happened to me a few times in my life. Like, I'll be eating with friends or family and then they drop these plates off... Snack plates. And then one of them is fucking disgusting. It's like, you know, I understand you hate your job, but could you at least look at the plates when you fucking grab them?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:23.312 --> 1:03:23.430]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:39.242 --> 1:04:53.948]: 
  100 years from now they're gonna look back on diners and like think we're just savages like yeah, they ate off like dirty Jeff you watch it's always so in Philadelphia yet not yet I think that was easily one of my top favorite shows every time I try to put it on I just look it has like 18 seasons And I kind of it almost turns me off So that's one of the few shows that I can say I think stays pretty consistent. It takes a different like season 7 Season 7 is not as strong But I think one of the best episodes of season 8 and 9 It's pretty hard for me to find TV shows that I could watch now and lap at yeah, like actually appreciate because I don't know I don't know if you guys get this too But since what it's kind of we're in the business of doing kind of what they do yeah I every time I see something like it I see a comedy movie or I see anything like that I immediately start dissecting it all people can just watch stuff and forget about it But you know the kind of glaze over it or never as a final product But what I love this is just just with us but definitely whatever see something like with my parents or my friends or something Who don't like they see something like oh this is good. Look at that you look at that shot right there You can see this and there's like oh like they don't notice that your parents will just watch a movie and fucking from redbox Watching like whatever no put it. That's true another another good movie. It's like no that was shitty because this is a

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:46.313 --> 1:03:48.439]: 
  It was a dirt-aggressed surrender.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:55.442 --> 1:03:55.780]: 
  Every time

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:04.015 --> 1:04:04.420]: 
  It takes a...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:50.084 --> 1:04:50.505]: 
  That's true.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:50.505 --> 1:04:52.125]: 
  Another another

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:53.948 --> 1:05:05.524]: 
  Another game I like to play is when you're watching a really awful movie is to predict the jokes before they happen That's a fun game Just so you know how horrible movie is where you can actually predict the joke

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:05.102 --> 1:05:42.936]: 
  Maybe I'm alone in this but I actually avoid I actually kind of avoid anything funny or trying to be funny I'll watch South Park, but I think South Park curb and always so you're the only three shows I watch That's the tryout of shows. I largely avoid it all because I know just make me mad like I watching something I'm funny puts me in a Burst mood than almost anything right so I just I watch like serious dramas. I watch documentaries and that's about it I don't know. I just avoid just fucking boring ass war documentary What I saw I saw it was coming Michael so easy woman. You know you know speaking of movies what cliches and movies you fuck

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:13.320 --> 1:05:13.557]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:32.592 --> 1:05:33.435]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:36.287 --> 1:05:37.080]: 
  What's talking about?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:38.295 --> 1:05:38.498]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:38.498 --> 1:05:39.865]: 
  Thank you very much.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:42.936 --> 1:05:52.167]: 
  the hate the old the fucking thing you're talking about today I hate the Wilhelm scream the Wilhelm Scream it's like God what one thing I hate more than a piece over

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:47.813 --> 1:08:45.372]: 
  I swear to God. One thing I hate more than anything? You know what the worst cliche to me is? What's that? It's like when they turn around and they're like, celebrity name, and it's the celebrity. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Steve Buscemi. No, no, no, here's what it is. Megan Fox. Michael By. This pisses me off. I swear to God. I think this is the cliche or the trump I hate the most. More than anything. More than anything. Yeah. Anything. Yeah. Somebody does a video or a movie or a TV show, and they try to be funny and they say, oh hi, I didn't see you there. It is not funny. It's been done for the last two fucking decades. You're not clever, you're not witty. These people do a Kickstarter video and go, oh hi, I didn't see you there. You're a real fucking hot slurred girl. They're doing their business suits. They got their bubbles. That's been parroted. That's been parroted for the last 20 years. I did that one. That means it was a cliche 20 years ago. To go back to it, yeah, but. I didn't see you there. What did I say? Hi, I did see you there. Oh hi, I didn't see you. Yeah, put a spit on that please. No, but that's been done before too, because it's so obvious. They did a whole compilation video. Really? Of a Kickstarter people doing that. Oh, I didn't see you there. Oh, seriously? Did they actually do this? Yeah, Kickstarter themselves did it. Oh my god. It's infuriating. That really doesn't feel to be crisp. If you ever did that, I would hate out all this to hate you. I did that when I was 18 in an update video. Did you? Well, let me ask you, because you're one of the people, what compelled you to do that? It's just one of the things where you're like, you're not really thinking about it, you're like, I'll just do this. It's sort of like an easy transition into something. Yeah, it's like the easiest thing you can do. Yeah, but it's supposed to be funny. It's supposed to be funny. It's not funny. Hard to see you there. There's a huge camera in your face, get it? There's lots of things that we've done that aren't funny. That's supposed to be a copy directly. That's a specific joke we're copying. Sorry, Jeff, what are you saying? Oh, just to backtrack. I agree with Chris about the whole full name thing. That's one thing South Park doesn't do. Steve Jobs. SNL does it. South Park does it. The Sipsons does it. It says they have zero confidence in the caricature or the actor doing the impression. George Clooney, what are you doing here? Oh, hi, George Clooney. It's always like, banner big, brrrrr. And it's like Lady Gaga. And she's all like, I'm dancing, I'm dancing. You know, the young old guy said, he's like, hey, come on out. I have sex with the old office. And they have to say, hey, Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton, what do you do here? They could just be like, hey, Bill. It's always that exact delivery. It's like, Bill Clinton, Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise? Tom Cruise, what are you doing in Springfield? Oh, I'm just here to shoot a new movie for Scopes 7. I'm the fucking funny Simpsons. Good job. Just Tom Hanks, you dumbass. Yeah, whatever. Same fucking bullshit. Same guy. Oh my God, Jeff, what cliches, what tropes do you hate? What fucking drives you nuts when you see it? Just makes you want to gouge the eyes out of somebody. Oh man, I don't know. I don't know. The record scratch. You can't saw the record fucking scratch. Yeah, the record scratch is one of them. It's also one of those things where you're like, I'm making fun of a cliché.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:58.799 --> 1:05:59.305]: 
  authority.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:02.747 --> 1:06:04.435]: 
  It is. Here it is. Michael.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:31.030 --> 1:06:31.958]: 
  That's what business is about.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:56.241 --> 1:06:56.849]: 
  Oh, seriously?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:00.105 --> 1:07:01.067]: 
  Oh my god

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:18.752 --> 1:07:19.410]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:18.887 --> 1:07:19.259]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:20.946 --> 1:07:20.997]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:25.485 --> 1:07:25.587]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:27.004 --> 1:07:28.506]: 
  Lots of things that we've done that are important.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:34.446 --> 1:07:34.800]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:38.597 --> 1:07:41.567]: 
  That's one thing Southbrook doesn't exist.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:43.339 --> 1:07:45.449]: 
  It all says it says

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:51.321 --> 1:07:52.604]: 
  George, Chloe, what are you doing?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:54.021 --> 1:07:54.595]: 
  It's always like...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:56.755 --> 1:07:58.240]: 
  You're pretty Gaga, and she's all like...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:57.936 --> 1:07:59.894]: 
  She's all like, I'm dancing.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:58.999 --> 1:07:59.505]: 
  I'm dead.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:12.685 --> 1:08:14.558]: 
  Bill off! Yeah. Tom Cruise.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:34.234 --> 1:08:34.335]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:37.220 --> 1:08:38.099]: 
  Those two are great examples.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:39.432 --> 1:08:40.663]: 
  Oh yeah, the record's good.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:43.009 --> 1:09:16.439]: 
  Oh, I know I know but maybe it's because I'm an adult now, but I cannot stand Comedy relief and animated movies. Yeah, just like funny things and animal in the girl movie character I've just it infuriates me. I don't care what anyone says despicable me those little yellow guys Fucking thing of my life Making making fire engine sounds. Yes. I said hey tumbler. Thanks for making me favorite 90 million different fucking Gifts of that without me even doing it fucking ass

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:53.759 --> 1:08:55.665]: 
  Animal, the gargoyles.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:03.934 --> 1:09:07.073]: 
  Fucking thing I've ever seen in my life like making

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:15.899 --> 1:09:31.828]: 
  I thought you could prove you're wrong. comedic relief? Spider-Pig, and he's hilarious. Oh, God. I think one thing I hate in TV shows is anytime they try to interject forced romance, where they, it's like, ah, we have to appeal to teen girls somehow.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:31.643 --> 1:09:38.460]: 
  I hate that too. When you're watching movies and then there's like, oh, there has to be a fucking romance

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:36.149 --> 1:09:55.454]: 
  It has to be the romance and then even the characters have no chemistry They're crying and you know, and you're just like like in the movie Godzilla. There's this utterly unnecessary romance That you feel nothing you could just do you hear less of these huge monsters?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:53.006 --> 1:10:02.372]: 
  There's a huge monster screaming for you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:02.372 --> 1:10:25.761]: 
  Save the kid. You listen to kick ass, have a love interest. And to tie into that, I do have the one cliche. Close spoilers. Because you have to have the, okay, so they have to have the romance. And then they're like, well, okay, we have the girl. Now, what does the girl do the whole movie? Oh, yummy. And they make her the fucking, they make her work in a hospital. Yeah. All these movies. It's all these disaster movies, disaster movies. Yeah, every disaster movie, they have to have the girl working as a nurse in the hospital. Oh, god, yeah. They have to have the girl working as a nurse in the hospital.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:19.011 --> 1:10:20.142]: 
  It's all Jesus' fault.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:21.390 --> 1:10:21.424]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:24.529 --> 1:10:32.460]: 
  in the hospital. Yeah, they have to. Every, you know, they got like, you know why? Because they have to contribute to the movie at one point. I know, that's why. Yeah, they have to have the...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:26.385 --> 1:10:28.225]: 
  Every every you know you got you know why

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:30.486 --> 1:11:15.947]: 
  I know, that's why. Yeah, they have to have a character from the movie come into the hospital and they can interact with that character. But it's like, even in fucking Spider-Man 2, they didn't have anything for Aunt May to do, so they made it go work in a fucking hospital. Yeah, it was Godzilla 2 as well, right? Like, why is Aunt May working in a hospital? There was a point in Spider-Man 2 where two planes were about to crash into each other. Oh my god, yeah, there's a point. The amazing Spider-Man 2. The amazing Spider-Man 2 where Susie's two planes about to crash into each other. Chris went to laugh at the theater. You know why? Because it's like, Okay, he's already fighting the Green Goblin or something, the Electro guy, or whatever. It's like, it's so... Spider-Man has no idea about the planes at all. I swear to God, they were like, okay, the scene's really tense. How about two airplanes almost hitting each other, and then they go, two initially fucking ravine away from each other. Can I talk about that?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:45.218 --> 1:10:45.404]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:49.842 --> 1:10:55.309]: 
  There was a point in Splatoon where two planes were about to crash into each other. Oh my god, yeah, there's a point. The amazing Splatoon.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:13.770 --> 1:11:32.029]: 
  Can I talk about that? I thoroughly enjoy the first, even though people hate the third one, I still think it's better than Amazing Spider-Man. Yeah, for sure! I love the first, I love Spider-Man 1 and 2 is really good and 3 is alright. 2 is my favorite. But fucking the amazing, I don't want to watch it. The Amazing Spider-Man 1 stings me.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:20.841 --> 1:11:21.870]: 
  Yeah, for sure.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:26.612 --> 1:11:27.017]: 
  favorite

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:30.443 --> 1:11:45.445]: 
  The Amazing Spider-Man 1 states, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 stinks. The only reason that they chose Mark Webb to direct it is because his name is Webb. No, seriously, I would honestly believe that that's fucking true. I don't like Spider-Man 3. It's not pretty shit, dude. I think it's alright. It is better.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:36.771 --> 1:11:39.944]: 
  I would honestly believe that that's fucking cute.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:39.944 --> 1:11:40.720]: 
  Where'd he go?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:42.492 --> 1:11:49.950]: 
  Shit, I think it's alright, but it's better. I hate it because I think it's bad, but I also think it's kind of charming There's too much

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:49.950 --> 1:12:14.301]: 
  This is my problem with movies. This is one of my biggest problems with somebody's writing a movie script is coincidence. Yes, there's too much fucking coincidence like like the way Venom is introduced into the story. He just happens. I fucking hate it. He just happens to be in the church. But regardless, like how he lands in the park just next to Spider-Man. He could have landed anywhere on the fucking planet. That's not it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:57.021 --> 1:11:57.375]: 
  else.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:02.877 --> 1:12:05.830]: 
  He's a t-shirt. Dude, he happens to be in the shirts.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:12.276 --> 1:12:18.570]: 
  on the fucking planet. That's not a cliche, I hate, but that is something I fucking hate. They could have had these sort of.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:17.490 --> 1:12:39.074]: 
  They could have at least thought what them though, but that's the thing right they actually like made the comic story Stupider for some reason. No, yeah It makes sense in the comics because I think he's a scientist the parasite I think see spider-man and then wants to be like him or something like that No, like he's a scientist who just happens to be like it does that it comes to his like lab because he's a scientist That makes sense. Okay, if we're

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:24.038 --> 1:12:24.494]: 
  No, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:32.087 --> 1:12:32.999]: 
  No, like, he's...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:32.999 --> 1:12:33.302]: 
  That's a sign.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:38.854 --> 1:13:03.880]: 
  If we're talking about things, I don't know if it's a cliche, but it's something I'm fucking tired of seeing is basically scripted movies where things happen to go to the next scene. For instance, it's like set piece after set piece. Like set piece after set piece, like oh here's a working car so we can get to the next location. Like that fucking movie, 2012 or something. Oh god. Oh, we're joking you said. Where everything just suddenly lend to the fucking ship, nothing went wrong. I think, I think it's a good idea.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:49.097 --> 1:12:50.852]: 
  This is like set piece after set piece.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:57.855 --> 1:12:58.969]: 
  Oh, what y'all keep saying?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:03.374 --> 1:13:09.111]: 
  I think the worst part of that movie is the whole fucking thing. He's like, He's like driving all the way underneath it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:05.837 --> 1:13:15.490]: 
  Yeah, it's a jolt music deriving over a football yonder. It's fucking retarded, but it's annoying because it's like this wouldn't happen. You would, you're a fucking rubble kill you immediately you'd be dead.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:15.389 --> 1:13:19.304]: 
  That movie in the day after tomorrow, the two worst disaster movies.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:19.304 --> 1:13:23.944]: 
  And then there's that other fucking one that you hate that I don't like, well, Swarzy.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:22.324 --> 1:13:22.881]: 
  That was it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:23.944 --> 1:13:26.999]: 
  Oh my god, I've seen that movie ten times.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:26.999 --> 1:13:30.947]: 
  That literally is a set piece movie.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:30.576 --> 1:13:33.445]: 
  That movie is honestly the worst shit I've ever seen.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:33.445 --> 1:13]: 
  It's literally like, I'm sorry, but it's literally like a fucking video game like it goes to the next level No, because video games are fun Yeah, but it goes to the next level, the next set piece

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:38.254 --> 1:13:39.824]: 
  No, because video games are fun.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:41.882 --> 1:14:08.258]: 
  The second I started to hate that, we used what a fucking 8-year-old who had never held a pistol shot of zombie point-blanket-eyes the first time. Exactly! It's like, yeah. This child has never held a gun, picks up a handgun, and shoots a zombie right between the eyes on his first shot. Are you fucking kidding me? Jeff, what you were saying earlier about coincidence, there's like a rule to writing where you can only use coincidence to get the main character to get into trouble. Not out. Yeah, you never use coincidence to get the main character to get into trouble when you're writing. Yeah, it just, it just, yeah, it ruins the story, it just...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:47.586 --> 1:13:47.687]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:49.915 --> 1:13:52.581]: 
  She says there we hold the gun, picture go ahead go then

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:55.534 --> 1:13:56.142]: 
  Thank you, Jeff.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:08.174 --> 1:14:15.177]: 
  It's fucking like you, you're like, yeah, okay, this plane crashed and then they're near, they're two seconds from the location. That makes sense.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:15.177 --> 1:16:29.502]: 
  Yeah, when all these bad things are always happening around you, but if it happens once to get you into the story But if it's constantly and then it's just happening over and over it just it's just lazy There should be like some logic some reason what I like needs to be a point Sorry, but I like is movies have balls and kill off big characters. Oh, yeah, like yes Finally did you I like that one. Do you ever see the issue deep blue sea? Yeah? Deep blue show it's started it's a shark movie, but it starts Sam L.

No, that's a bit extravagant Chris. You have a year the richest guy in the universe What would you do if you had what would you read project would you fulfill and create with it?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:57.445 --> 1:19:18.505]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:08.481 --> 1:19:08.835]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:18.505 --> 1:20:00.220]: 
  the hell I want. Jeff what about you? What would you do if you had a limited budget? I would become a dictator. Jeff would you rebuild the Thunderdome? Yes, you would. There would be Thunderdome's in every town in city in America. Would you wear the beard like Sasha Byron Colin and be like I'm the dick there. No, no I would probably wear metal shoulder pads. Who would you make fight in the Thunderdome? Seth and Paul and Buck Wilson? Anybody that had a problem with the death. Anybody that had an argument they would fight to the death. A white sis veil versus the internet. All all Tumblr people would be thrown. I would build a giant blender and throw all Tumblr people into the blender. Wait I used Tumblr but I used it. And then fertilize the fields with their corpse.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:26.959 --> 1:19:26.976]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:42.484 --> 1:19:43.109]: 
  together.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:55.444 --> 1:19:56.997]: 
  Well I used tumblr but I used it as a

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:00.220 --> 1:20:02.937]: 
  I use tumblr as an art gallery, you're not gonna take out.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:03.021 --> 1:20:38.644]: 
  If you use Tumblr as an art gallery that is acceptable, those people can move over to a new site. We'll just call it something else. That's a good idea. Better term. People who argue about feminism and... We could buy Tumblr.com and put the E at the end of the event. Social justice horseshit on Tumblr will all be killed. Most of the people on YouTube will be killed. YouTube will become a respectable place again for hard-working people. Yes. Who care about their content. Not pranks and... What about the Jalaskins? Jalaskins? What happens to them? You know, I haven't seen their videos yet and I don't plan to, but... They're fertilizer. They're fertilizer. They're beginning to fertilizer. But as a gift to you, they can die. I think the best thing they'll ever do is become fertilizer for the plants of the Earth.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:08.590 --> 1:20:08.624]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:12.336 --> 1:20:13.939]: 
  We could buy tumblr.com and put the

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:13.939 --> 1:20:15.104]: 
  be at the end of the day.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:28.857 --> 1:20:28.958]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:31.101 --> 1:20:33.396]: 
  But as it忙les, it OK a lot of our participants and Audreyλ

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:38.644 --> 1:20:42.357]: 
  Anyways, that was your question beside...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:40.197 --> 1:20:47.014]: 
  I would be like M. Bison Street Fighter. I'd have fighting tournaments.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:46.575 --> 1:20:53.680]: 
  So you would have ThunderDome, you would build a mansion, I would make a TV show. Yeah, I would do it for a water tower.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:51.925 --> 1:20:57.477]: 
  I would do it for a while and if I had a limited money I would just like play that on a TV show a couple of arcs

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:56.987 --> 1:21:02.624]: 
  You could have any actor you want. Any actor you want. And I could be like, you know what? I want this actor.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:21:02.607 --> 1:21:21.237]: 
  Cause the hard thing about TV or just anything is really like, well if you get a TV show you have to kind of plan it from the beginning. So say you have a three season arc of a TV show and you only get a minute for one season. I'm gonna buy all the water. I'll give you guys some but it's gonna be mine. If you guys wanna donate to my mansion, donate to- Oh my god. This is bullshit. I don't wanna live in a world where you're addicted to-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:17.929 --> 1:21:18.992]: 
  Oh my god.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:18.992 --> 1:21:26.755]: 
  This is bullshit. I don't want to live in a world where you're a dictator and run fucking Thunderdoms. I'm putting this resident evil mansion to your body to kill you instead.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:21:22.840 --> 1:22:14.849]: 
  I'm resident evil mansion. Give your money to charity instead. Feed hungry children instead of getting Chris fucking stupid. I will allow Chris to build his mansion on a corner of some continent somewhere and then put a fence on it. No, I want to put it in the middle of the woods and make it super authentic. You just said all, Jeff, there's like 60,000 nukes in the world. Just give him all the Chris in his mansion. I want to make it super authentic. I will pull all scientists off all like AIDS and cancer research and have them create real zombies and then throw them in Chris's mansion. Thank you. I'm gonna knock the doors. Because here it's real. This is real life. Chris is a red vest and a handgun with like three bullets and a green and red plant and wish him luck. Guys, I play zombie games all the time. I definitely survive. I hate that argument. Do you ever hear people like, I play love for dead. I want to be fun and the zombie apocalypse. Yeah, just like you shoot a gun and it falls into your hand. And you fucking throw your shoulder out the back like, yeah. One finger now scratch and you're gonna be a zombie.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:28.695 --> 1:21:29.809]: 
  I will allow

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:33.083 --> 1:21:35.901]: 
  No, I want to put it in the middle of the woods.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:41.284 --> 1:21:41.470]: 
  I would

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:52.725 --> 1:21:54.987]: 
  This is real life.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:56.219 --> 1:21:57.450]:

  안녕!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:14.764 --> 1:22:33.681]: 
  Let me tell you something, there was a zombie apocalypse, um, cause I've had numerous chances to like experience it in my dreams. I've had every zombie dream you could think of. Which is funny, because in the Angry Video Game Nerd movie, I could relate so much to the part with his dream sequence. Where there's a part where he's just in a fucking amusement park and suddenly there's zombies.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:23.590 --> 1:22:23.894]: 
  Which is

 SPEAKER_03 [1:22:33.107 --> 1:22:36.314]: 
  Either zombies either. You're assuming I'd even watch that feature.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:36.314 --> 1:22:41.950]: 
  No, I'm saying like a situation where it's like it actually was like wow that's like a fucking dream I would have

 SPEAKER_03 [1:22:41.950 --> 1:22:47.468]: 
  where suddenly there's zombies. If you say anger, be a gamer, you can just say horror. You can be my Lisa Trevor.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:46.945 --> 1:22:48.531]:
