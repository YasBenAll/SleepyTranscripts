 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:00.497 --> 0:00:16.259]: 
  B.C.D.E.F.G. H.H.J.K. L.B.B. Q.R.S. T.U.B. W.S. Wyatt Zach! I want to know on a scale of 1 to 10 how white that sound is.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:00:16.647 --> 0:00:36.914]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense. A world enveloped by a seemingly unending ocean of forests. Buried deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little cabin. And in that cabin...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:36.914 --> 0:02:32.659]: 
  There's a bunch of guys, there's a bunch of bullshitter. Welcome to SleepyCast episode... Ehhhhh... I'm joined by my good friends and colleagues, Johnny Utah. Hey, I'm eating. Hi. Hahaha. Uh, the sexy Will Stamper. Heyyyyyyyy! And the brilliant young genius, Zachary. I only have one week to live. This is a Wich Foundation. True. Speaking of one week to live, I have a question I wanted to start off with. If there was a major solar flare and all technology, now besides all the like the chaos around us and probably wars and religious cults, all mass suiciding and stuff, just, let's just say that computers didn't exist anymore, there was no more technology, what would you guys do? Let me interrupt you there for a second, Mick. Oh. Define solar flare for some of our less intelligent users. Solar flare is when the sun... I'm talking about me!...farts really hard and a blast of radiation. Look, Stamper, here's what it's like, right? Here's what it's like, alright, listen. You land about the cat, you've had too much beer, you fight, the cat runs away. Alright, the cat in this situation is computers, it runs away with you, the sun is your ass, okay? The flare, you understand? The flare, sorry, your ass is the sun, the fart is the flare. Okay, Mick, go on. Hahaha. That's a good, you can't say it better than that, can you? I can. It's an electromagnetic... Yeah. Yeah, it just... When the sun sends out an electromagnetic pulse, then it like short circuits everything, it basically fries everything. Now to clarify, are you talking about... Is that even possible? Yeah. Yeah, it almost happened a couple years ago. There was a threat. There was a threat. I mean, there's... To get everything all around the planet, it was one blast. Right, so our ozone is supposed to protect us from that, it's supposed to protect us from like electromagnetic radiation. It does. That's why I was invented, so it could protect our computers and all of our images. Albert Einstein created the ozone layer to protect us from future... 1985. But Jeff, what were you going to say?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:28.315 --> 0:01:29.901]: 
  less intelligent users.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:56.547 --> 0:01:57.458]: 
  I can't.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:59.061 --> 0:02:00.985]: 
  Yeah. Yeah, it just hit a little bit here.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:06.452 --> 0:02:06.520]: 
  Bye!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:06.520 --> 0:02:06.638]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:09.642 --> 0:02:12.460]: 
  Yeah, yeah, it almost happened a couple years ago. There was a threat.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:13.607 --> 0:02:17.050]: 
  To get everything all around the planet, our ozone blasts.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:22.129 --> 0:02:24.576]: 
  It does!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:25.268 --> 0:02:26.736]: 
  All of our images are amazing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:29.183 --> 0:02:29.993]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:32.372 --> 0:02:35.714]: 
  There's a couple of holes in his theory.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:33.942 --> 0:06:08.001]: 
  This son has shot out flares that would have destroyed earth, but we were just lucky we it wasn't aimed at us Yeah, so the Also, so we've dodged a few bullets. It's also happy like a matter of time It's also happy like the 1800s early like I didn't give it in early 1900s where all different fuck up phones for a little bit Or whatever so I know it did also happen in 1800s because I remember all the all their buggies just stopped like all the horses Just dropped dead See a world of the world's whatever he's like nothing's working. He has a good music recording on his video Yeah, there was something I read about that saying if that flare hit back then if we had the electronic back then that we have now It would have yeah everything yeah, yeah, the issue is you could say oh well They'd read it everything whatever or they would fix everything But the issue is it goes to the belly that goes to the bottom like the bottom of it There's nothing you fix really with who okay? What's the question so so the question would you do like in terms of like currently we're all animators and we do stuff on computers Stand up comedy are we talking about? Zero power or just zero that's why I meant like not apocalypse just really the solar flare was Like this let's say like this animation dries up. Nobody wants to see 2d films anymore. There's no more television There's no websites. There's no more tech, you know design type great Stand up comedy all the kids want to see 3d you would you try movies instead of the classic So we've got one we got stand-up comedy As I could still entertain. Oh, I'm just gonna go full mad max. I'm just gonna wear spike shoulder pads It's just like right now though Jeff. Yeah, no, but it's just like right now I'll be the funny guy in the crew where I'm like You have like the fogged up goggles You got the skull painted on your face The window with like the axe and they got dudes hanging upside down with chains and I'm just like What make you serious won't be the thing that would happen We'd be like listen listen Jeff like you drop the actual minute Jeff knows you are playing around This is real. What would be the thing he would have to do that he would do we need to get Pussy when you get some pussy Listen listen Jeff we need to get a side Jeff we push me or I'd start an official Thunderdome Yes in town I would run it You'd be the ringmaster I would it would be culling the overpopulation of the area and doing and providing entertainment Yeah, what everybody didn't like you were they all overpowered you and they hated your idea Who's gonna hate that idea? Since the beginning of time people have loved watching people fucking slug it out We've had the gladiators the Russians that have big guys like Zangief fighting bears people love to watch People fucking honestly I think even in the movie the Thunderdome could be improved It could combine the Thunderdome and the Colosseum right we could have a Thunderdome But we could still flight with water we can have naval battles I'm surprised ever could be the stand-up comedy at the beginning of the show like the clowns put a floating platform out in the middle He could entertain I'll be the guy who walks out at all fours with like a food tray in his back Walks around the screws or people grab like cheese up my back You know it's Yeah, I don't I like I scurry I scurry the aisles people go god what they think It's a game you don't offer it if they see you then they get the peanuts I'm glad it pretzels go around go over the Thunderdome you climb over it. Yeah, all on all fours Yeah, be like in Harry Potter that little golden ball whatever it is The golden snitch or snitch yeah, you think the little snitch prize everybody's chasing you around Figure by asking all the food on top of me. I was wanted to get a peanut

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:37.069 --> 0:05:39.060]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:44.477 --> 0:05:45.389]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:48.342 --> 0:05:48.359]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:48.359 --> 0:05:49.962]: 
  We love it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:52.139 --> 0:05:52.527]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:53.438 --> 0:05:54.062]: 
  He'd be like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:56.172 --> 0:05:57.117]: 
  whatever it is.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:59.040 --> 0:05:59.564]: 
  Yeah, this is it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:03.192 --> 0:06:04.035]: 
  Moved into the people's tongue.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:05.436 --> 0:06:10.718]: 
  I always wanted to dub that scene. They get a peanut. I always wanted to dub that scene and have that ball fly around like, I'm gonna tell you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:10.515 --> 0:09:02.691]: 
  I'm gonna tell on you, I'm gonna fucking tell on you. I initially was gonna do a cartoon where he catches, cause you know he catches it in his mouth and then he coughs it up, but I want him to catch it, get up, and they're all like, whoo, and then just shoots out the top of his head and he fucking dies, the end. Harry Potter over. That's a really dark cartoon. Hey, off the back of the question you asked earlier, what percentage of the population do you think would kill themselves if Facebook and Twitter ceased to exist this second? Well, honestly, that's maybe like 4%. No, no, no, no, no, but let's rephrase it. It's still shocking though. No, rephrase it. Nothing comes to its place because the second, like if Facebook was pulled today, a copy would come up immediately that everybody would use. Oh, nothing would come back up. Okay, okay, so I'd say, I think- It would take time. I would say within six months to a year, I would say a lot of people would kill themselves. I think you'd be happier actually. If nobody was allowed to kill themselves immediately, I think people would be like, oh, there's people here. They all cloud score. If nobody was allowed to kill themselves? Like yeah, you put the good people in your mind, like hey, stop, no. You can't do that. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Yeah. You're gonna be in trouble. I was thinking about that earlier. And I was just like, man, if this all ceased to exist, because I use it for whatever promotional purposes, making stupid fucking jokes. Some people really read into it. To a serious degree. Can I recommend everybody listening to delete their Facebook? I did it about two years ago. It is so good. I mean, obviously, if you're like us, and you need like a Facebook page to manage your fan page, and just promote your shirts or whatever the fuck, make a little account with no friends or whatever, no profile picture. But I deleted it. And dude, it is honestly, it's one less thing. You wake up and you're like, what do you do? Email, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook. Well, think about Facebook. Facebook posts are so long that I can't, anytime I go to see the feed, I can't see it all. All that happened when I had Facebook was, everyone's like, well, if I deleted it, how am I gonna be in touch with my high school friends I never talked to? It's like, you weren't talking to them to begin with. All I did on Facebook was get irritated at my stupid family, my stupid high school friends. Who'd be like, my cousin, I would send people Snoop's articles every day, when you're like, what's the, the bug stuff? So I, somebody would post an article that'd be like, Obama's gonna put a nail through everyone's face that sends signals to hell that makes you the devil. I'm like, oh, no. Yeah. People would post things like that every day. They'd post like a fake book, Cosby clone. We don't. You learn a lot, you learn a lot about people when you see the shit that they fucking do. You can't tell everyone to cut off their Facebooks because everybody uses them differently. It's like having a car. I'm saying this, if you don't require it, cut it off. I, nobody, do it for me. Okay, do this. Don't log onto Facebook for a week if you can. See how good you feel. Some people use it for business, just like some people use the car for work. Some people use their car to pick up their kids. Some people use their car because they're a fucking douchebag that likes to show their fucking car off. I'm saying this, if you, if you use it like, I have a business Facebook, but I don't have anybody added on it. I still have Facebook, but I don't have to log on because there's nothing you see there. Don't use Facebook for like a week. That's all I'm saying. All right, Jeff, tell us why, what?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:23.104 --> 0:06:24.049]: 
  That's a really dark one.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:34.917 --> 0:06:35.372]: 
  Honestly, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:46.425 --> 0:06:46.510]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:46.510 --> 0:06:47.438]: 
  Nothing can come back up.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:47.438 --> 0:06:47.674]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:48.771 --> 0:06:49.362]: 
  Get the gun.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:53.867 --> 0:06:54.745]: 
  I think you can have it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:01.326 --> 0:07:04.296]: 
  If nobody was allowed to kill themselves?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:06.034 --> 0:07:06.507]: 
  We knew that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:07.553 --> 0:07:09.139]: 
  Yeah, it's just weird to think.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:19.484 --> 0:07:20.884]: 
  to a serious degree.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:44.054 --> 0:07:46.450]: 
  Think about Facebook. Facebook posts are so long.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:49.825 --> 0:07:51.933]: 
  See it all. Like this is too much.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:59.663 --> 0:08:00.456]: 
  Oh, oh

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:18.749 --> 0:08:19.137]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:22.427 --> 0:08:23.322]: 
  You learn a lot.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:26.393 --> 0:08:26.697]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:30.392 --> 0:08]: 
  having a car.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08 --> 0:08:31.540]: 
  I'm so

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:00.447 --> 0:09:00.599]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:03.417 --> 0:13:27.983]: 
  I was just saying it was making me, it was making me, the one month I had it years ago it was making me hate the people I knew in real life. That's what I mean. The stuff they had posted. Yeah. It was so hateable. Yeah. I just had to delete it. I said I can't deal with this anymore. And plus you know I was always getting, I was always getting friend requests from people I didn't know at all like and I'm like these people I don't want to share personal information with and I don't. Yeah. So just getting awkward. Yeah. No that's what I did too. It is interesting how it's also watered down the word friend. Like. Yeah. You know I was talking to Greg. Greg is a very fine gentleman who works at our house and fixes things. He's very talented and capable man. Is that your only thing? I do. He's fucking brilliant. Yeah. That's awesome. He is brilliant. I just wanted to hear you guys like fucking great. All these fucking dicks getting pubes all over the place. Hey. No. No. You said Greg always cuts his pubes over the sink. Yeah but I asked him to. So it makes sense. Yeah and he said he didn't clear it up and he yeah. Yeah. So anyway he was he we were talking about just friends in general and he's like I don't get it. I don't you know you guys talk about friends but he's like I've seen all these people who call themselves friends. They don't even talk to each other. You know they're sitting there on their phones and then they won't even talk to each other for weeks or whatever. It's like I had friends you know if I need someone to bail me out of a gang fight. These are the people who would come you know to my side. I want to know how many people that you call friends that would come you know to your side if your life was in danger. That would be in your foxhole. Yeah. That would be in your foxhole. We had that foxhole conversation too. But it was funny. I mean I mean it's interesting the idea that we had we call people friends but the truth is for a lot of these quote unquote friends people couldn't give a fuck. Yeah so do this. Flip through your cell phone right now and think about that and remove everybody who's a piece of shit. Worthless asshole. I think people are too easy too easy going with who they associate with. I feel like there needs to be an initiation. Sure. Yeah there needs to be a test. I have to put somebody in a life and death situation and see what they do before. I'm like all right you're my friend. Right. You have to. Yeah because I you know what because if you don't have that test yeah when you actually have a life threatening situation guess what you're fucked because they're not going to be standing behind you. I mean stamp would pass you pass. Exactly. Save you. What's the situation. No I'm depending on the test. What's the test. Give me a test. You'd run away or. Okay what so he walks through the gun. Yeah all right say that yeah. You think stamp would jump before the gun like if it's okay walk through the gun you think stamp like hold on stop. I think stamp I would not because you would shit your pants and faint like a dog. No you know I wouldn't even think about it. I just be like oh he's got a gun. Uh oh plus I don't give a shit if I die. I would do it just because he doesn't give a shit. Mick would do it at a pride bravery and I do it. I think Zach Zach would attempt to compromise with the guy to attempt to barter with him or something. I would try to try to outsmart him. I'd take Jeff's arm. Well that's what I would be so good man. It better call Saul because break his legs it's fine don't kill him. Okay. Just get your sexual satisfaction. You'd all solve it a different way so you're all unique in that regard. You guys already had the conversation though about like if you if they're at gunpoint. Yeah. Who would you would you take a bullet. I don't think there's one person on the earth that I would. I think at gunpoint is a very different thing than a reactionary thing. Okay let's say it like this. It's reactionary. Let's say like I think. That's what you really care. Yeah. Let's say like this let's say a serial killer captures you and somebody else. Okay. I'm going to torture you or you make pick. I want to torture you or Jeff to death. To death. So I'm gonna die and it's gonna be slow and painful. No he says you're free to go. I will let you go right now. No I mean the person who's getting tortured though is gonna die. Yes. But first they're gonna make it really painful before they do it. Everyone's had this scenario in their head before. Look he's like you say fuck you because you can't trust the guy. The end. Yeah you know what I would do in that situation. I would I would charge the guy and if he shot me he shot me. He ties me then I. He whacks you with a brick. He whacks you with another brick. He whacks you with a third brick. You wake up. You're tied up with your pal Jeff. Jeff's like Jeff's like okay I'll be Jeff. This is one of those scenarios where you just keep adding variables to it. No that's the setup right. Okay I'm Jeff. Nick what are we gonna do? What are we gonna pick right now? Do you have my back Nick? I think all the times I called you Chinese and made your photos on Twitter black and white I didn't mean it Jeff. I didn't mean it. Okay Nick listen to me. I'm serious right now. Okay. I think I should be the one that goes free.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:10.200 --> 0:09:10.690]: 
  That's what I mean.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:24.510 --> 0:09:24.949]: 
  Yeah.

  Uh huh.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:43.292 --> 0:09:46.701]: 
  Don't you really think? I do. He's fucking brilliant. Yeah, no, that's awesome.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:46.701 --> 0:09:47.241]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:55.577 --> 0:09:57.214]: 
  Yeah, but I asked him to, so it makes sense.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:49.274 --> 0:10:50.337]: 
  associate with associate

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:52.784 --> 0:10:54.539]: 
  Yeah, there needs to be a test.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:14.384 --> 0:11:15.244]: 
  This is about depending on...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:19.598 --> 0:11:20.340]: 
  Okay, one

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:23.766 --> 0:11:24.239]: 
  Yeah.

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:52.487 --> 0:11:55.052]: 
  There you go, alright. Look, take Jeff's arm.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:55.052 --> 0:11:55.896]: 
  That's what they do.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:03.152 --> 0:12:03.507]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:17.429 --> 0:12:17.445]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:17.445 --> 0:12:20.432]: 
  Okay, let's let's say like it's reactionary. Let's say like I

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:19.943 --> 0:12:20.095]: 
  like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:20.432 --> 0:12:21.023]: 
  I think that's what you really want.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:21.732 --> 0:12:22.120]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:30.675 --> 0:12:30.962]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:35.114 --> 0:12:35.907]: 
  No, I mean the person

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:37.662 --> 0:12:38.050]: 
  But for

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:38.708 --> 0:12:40.159]: 
  really painful before they do it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:39.957 --> 0:12:40.244]: 
  Peace.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:50.115 --> 0:12:51.398]: 
  And if you shot me, you shot me.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:01.202 --> 0:13:06.197]: 
  This is one of those scenarios where you just keep adding variables to it. That is the setup, right?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:20.035 --> 0:13:22.161]: 
  Make it to the maith!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:31.679 --> 0:14:01.868]: 
  Listen I know you don't want it to happen, but I need to be the one that goes free I know you're there, but I'm sorry I'll tell everyone you're pretty, I'll tell them you cried a little bit You know I'm more talented than you, if I, if you go, at least I can live on and keep the dream alive I can go on Twitter, Photoshop, Angel wings on you I'll be like, bro, I have more Twitter followers than you? Look at the facts, look at all these facts If you die, I'm gonna make you, I'm gonna draw you hugging the genie Would you do that when you say to me, you have more Twitter followers?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:36.201 --> 0:13:39.154]: 
  I know it's free. I know, I'm sorry. I'll tell everyone you're-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:57.615 --> 0:13:58.004]: 
  You do that.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:04.214 --> 0:15:28.639]: 
  No, I mean, honestly, I think... What if the torture ain't that bad? It's like, I'll cut your penis off and fucking fuck you or something. I would look at McDead in the eyeballs and do a thing that was like one, two, three, and we would figure something out in that third second to get around the situation. Yeah, what we do is we look at each other and at the same time we'd go, Pick me! Pick me! And then we'd just keep repeating it and then he wouldn't know who to pick. It'd be like a Looney Tunes cartoon. Yeah, that's right. Or I can't tell him apart. You could kill yourself, be like, Okay, you want to kill yourself? Yeah, it could be used to make him kill himself. Like, oh, kill myself. You know, I'm not even... We would just annoy him so much until they kill themselves. In all seriousness, though, if there was that situation, self-preservation, I think, could take. But that's if there's a conscious decision to be made. But also, I think the thing is too, if you're going to talk about the mind of the killers, because a lot of killers do, if they have both, they do do that stuff. Like the call-by-killers, they did that stuff. They're like, you believe in God? Right. And people said, yes, they shoot him. Like, that was so, so it's like, you can't really trust fucking psychos like that. Right, I was gonna say, yeah, in high school, now, no fuck God. Yeah. You can't ask that question when you're that young. Not to be me. Well, they did. They did? My mom sent me a book called Jesus is Calling or something like that. And uh... Screw you, dude. No, I... He's just gonna be drunk again. I was like, dude... Let him go to voicemail. No, I said, yeah, I was gonna say, if he wants to call me, he's got my number. He knows how to reach me. The food of Jesus voicemail sound like, give us the Jesus voicemail.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:19.367 --> 0:14:20.920]: 
  Yeah, what we do is we look at...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:28.092 --> 0:14:28.952]: 
  Yeah, that's right.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:29.931 --> 0:14:31.247]: 
  I can't tell them apart.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:46.975 --> 0:14:47.329]: 
  Maar als er...

  I was like dude. Let me go to boys.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:20.438 --> 0:15:25.703]: 
  No, I said yeah, I was gonna say if he wants to call me he's got my number. He knows how to reach me

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:28.639 --> 0:15:31.660]: 
  If Jesus was on the voicemail.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:08.937 --> 0:16:35.397]: 
  I don't know what the hell I'd say. I'd listen to about five seconds of that voicemail message. You'd be like, hi, this is Jesus. Just I'd be, nah, delete. Yeah. Sorry, moving on. And it's like really, like, nah, bro, this is really Jesus. This is me for saying, you're like, who the fuck is this asshole? Could you stop telling Mexicans to call naming their kids after me? Thanks. They're all built in my dad's image, after all.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:13.004 --> 0:16:13.105]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:21.492 --> 0:16:22.082]: 
  Moving on.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:36.527 --> 0:17:47.706]: 
  Let's go to Alpac sometime. All 12 of us. Wow, offensive. This is getting offensive fast. I like Mexicans. Don't be silly. I worked as a busboy. They're very hard workers. Absolutely. And you know what? They complained, at least for the most part. I know that, you know when you compliment a whole race, they also consider that racism? When you're like all black dudes got a huge fucking wiener. And they're like, that's racist. It's like, no, it's a compliment. Black dudes do have huge wieners. I've heard black out ever. No, no, black guys said that to me, but I've had plenty of white people say, that's racist. You're making a lump assumption about an entire race. That's because they're worried about their tiny wieners. That's true too. They're probably just embarrassed. And when you say Mexicans work hard, white people get offended because I work hard too. See how it works? Exactly. But I was going to say that for the most part, as a busboy and a server, black guys do have big wieners. They do, I would know. And then also, well, I ended up dating a girl once. We were kind of sitting around, we were talking about that. We were lying in bed after we had had sex and I had mentioned the thing about like,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:02.380 --> 0:17:03.443]: 
  Blackbirds, you have huge-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:03.443 --> 0:17:04.422]: 
  Wee ne cer

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:16.200 --> 0:17:18.951]: 
  and when you say Mexicans were your friends

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:18.951 --> 0:17:20.098]: 
  That's what brands make.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:21.127 --> 0:17:21.954]: 
  Get off Twitter.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:24.030 --> 0:17:24.132]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:25.853 --> 0:17:25.954]: 
  But

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:47.605 --> 0:17:48.685]: 
  Oh yeah, you know

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:48.685 --> 0:19:41.410]: 
  It's funny that stereotype about black guys, you know, having big wieners and she just without hesitation was like oh they do Yeah, and like at first I was like Okay, ha ha ha, but then I was thinking like how many black dicks have you seen where the lump like you just yes You know for a fact all black dudes got huge wieners Anyways, the Mexican guys that I worked with complained so little like just they worked so hard They stayed later than everybody else to clean out like the oil like the front of the frying machine shit Everybody else went off to go to the local bar and fucking party or whatever and these guys worked so fucking hard They never complained. Hey, what brought this up this month? I think it was you all was talking with this morning when we were talking about that people aren't welcome here Oh, yeah, the whole idea of like oh because we were talking about Lewis and oh we were talking about Taxes or something like that and like everyone's got to pay taxes. Oh, no, I forgot what it was shit I'm gonna have to cut off like a patriotism nationalism thing It was it was about no it was about immigrants and how You know people were complaining about having immigrants here, but in all of America was basically built. Yeah, I was I was like, dude There's no such thing. I mean you're saying there was no such thing as America because Essentially or as like as far as when you say that I'm saying there's no such thing as American because again Like I walk a block this way and they're full-blown Korean. I walk a block that way. They're all white people walk a block that way They're all black people all Mexican people all Spanish people. It's just this crock pot. Yeah I feel like America say that in a little turn here, right? So it's like there's still Koreans and there's still Chinese and there's still Mexicans But there's an umbrella term for all of us here who are proud to have the freedoms We have and all that kind of stuff which is American is the theory that we don't want any more is that it am I missing the point, you know I'm going to say that somebody's looting you're polluting the white gene pool.

The monkeys like an urban legend, but there is a conspiracy that the government created AIDS to get rid of gay people. Right, but then I also heard that it was created, I heard that one, that they created it to kill gay people, but then I heard that it was more of like a population control thing as well. Which we sorely need. I just want to even create a super virus, like, or like, it's not even a virus technically. It's like a dude in a lab with a mustache and he's like, yes, this is going to kill everybody slowly over the course of 43 years. I think it's the same way, I mean, we have a lot of bio-weapons. Biological warfare. Biological warfare.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:31.656 --> 0:28:32.162]: 
  No, just-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:34.255 --> 0:28:36.179]: 
  What did you say about me asshole?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:36.179 --> 0:28:36.769]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:36.769 --> 0:28:36.989]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:57.272 --> 0:28:57.660]: 
 ight

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:04.343 --> 0:29:06.452]: 
  This is gonna kill everybody, slowly, over the course of...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:07.482 --> 0:29:08.039]: 
  It's the same one.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:13.523 --> 0:29:13.641]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:13.540 --> 0:29:13.692]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:14.485 --> 0:29:21.218]: 
  If we wanted to kill people, there's quicker, more effective ways of doing so. Well, a virus, if you... If you were a media...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:18.737 --> 0:29:28.272]: 
  Well, a virus if you... If you will mediate... You think about what people like to fuck, right? Yeah. So you give them a disease that if you fuck, you spread it, that's all we do. We fucking eat and fuck. A little bit.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:26.010 --> 0:29:31.022]: 
  We fucking eat and fuck. That's had HIV for the last 13 years, right? It hasn't.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:29.723 --> 0:39:25.410]: 
  Right, it hasn't gone into full blown age yet. No, the virus is technically alive though Like like by most biophones could you calm if poison if something if something really be super bugs are the reasonable like feasible way further They could be a way that we would die especially today I mean the black black dead killed me one third of Europe when it happened the black plague Yeah, yeah, and those pass from person to person without exactly we have airplanes and trains up People go people fly constantly. Yeah, you let's see from player the apes. Yeah, the Donald Playups at the beginning while the red lines would everywhere. Um, that was at the end. Thank you We've all seen that red line scene that red line Dawn sorry, okay, I'm fucking sorry. It's okay. I forget this time Don't do it again. Do you think the government is currently in the works creating a biological weapon or some kind of? I think they have to have with the plan to wipe out entire areas They have technology that we couldn't even wrap our brains around right now. I'm sure yeah No, I'm not a conspiracy fellow But I do think there's definitely a lot of stuff that the government has that we can't even we have no idea about and what's interesting It's not even just our government No, no, like I mean think about the other governments out there that are spent that I was in hate America and have nothing better to do because they're not fucking making movies and and making shows like desperate How they're not desperate housewives with real housewives of fucking New Jersey. How's that any different from desperate housewives? Desperate real housewives of New Jersey I'm almost willing to bet all the secret technology the government has isn't even that no It's like it'd be like oh, that's cool I'd be willing to bet that it is fairly impressive because the private sector there You know they have the brightest people ever right pumping out stuff so fast Like I don't see how I'll see like a secret no government lab even with a few thousand No, I'm not saying that there's like aliens and stuff. I'm just saying like I there's definitely there's absolutely I remember what Jimmy I'm not going that afar above and beyond either I'm saying there there are things that will definitely blow your mind But not to the like yeah, we're not going to Saturn in secret with Jimmy Carter came into office He said he would like What declassify I think it was I think I think it was a 51 hours you oppose stuff And we came into office you didn't do it because there's like a special bomber there were working on so like yeah But we know what it is now after it's been declassified for a little while JFK about it Who was it? Okay? This JFK thing is really bothering me in the sense where everybody who thinks it's a conspiracy who thinks there's like the Could the bit the could different one bullet that went through JFK's back and through Whatever so you think it was Oswald it was absolutely Oswald There was no second shooting the only room for conspiracy if you don't believe me look up What's it called it was um fucking wasn't time it was a I saw I can't remember what it was I can't remember who did it but I'll post In fact, I'll post a couple of really good ones if you want to watch if you're interested If you really think if you really think JFK was killed by a second gunman There's zero evidence for it every recreation every three recreation has proved that so we like to exactly the issue is everyone says Basically, there's a there's a single bullet theory where they say the bullet could do God through Basically, it was JFK the back The governor of Texas in the front seat and what boy went through the back of JFK's neck and through his shoulder We saw it through his neck or whatever and into the governor's Yes, so they say there's no way the bullet could have curved like fucking yeah But if you look at it the governor was not only not directly funny He was slung to the left and he was elevated or I think he was on a different level because the chairs were different Heights so it makes perfect sense. There's zero room for a second gunman Well, what I don't understand and also the bullet the bullet the bullet that for the gun He used does tub ball when it enters a body, which is exactly what happened They've done multiple tests on this every single one says it was Lee Harvey Oswald now the question The question is who was it? What motivated it? I think that's the only room for conspiracy when it comes to JFK is Why does it always have to be a major motivation? Maybe a guy just want to fucking kill the president? It's it's it's this theory where it's like he's the president He's this big and he had to be killed by somebody who is this big too People were refused to admit that a president could I mean for Christ's sake George W. Bush was choked out of pretzel Nobody nobody would believe that they like no it was the CIA to kill them because I think presidents are more than people A bullet killed JFK though it had to have been the cAA Shooting shooting him with a trillion different bullets from a billion different angles Obama slipped on a patch of ice and fucking broke his neck. There would be endless conspiracy theories about the thing It's like, yeah, who sprayed the sidewalk. Yeah, but then it's like, okay, so that's completely nonsense It could have been fucking anybody for any different motivation But the other thing is to what end like why shooting the president to killing the president is a pretty good fucking motivation Everybody remembers Lee Harvey Oswald's name fucking what 50 years after he died No, I mean to accomplish what if you have a Theory like okay, they killed JFK because they're trying to crack it open expose a lot One of the biggest theories are exposed what expose the cAA because they the cAA really wanted hated how how It was with Cuba, right? Yeah, he he botched the bad pigs They really wanted a man who was gonna go in there, but who took over it was fucking lindby johnson Yeah, it was lindby johnson who didn't do like he I don't know who do you think do you think oswald was hired? That that is the only rule book conspiracy world say, okay, maybe the only thing I think I don't think he was hard I think he was a psycho. He visited the soviet union multiple times. He just did like the president people Why did uh say he wasn't hired by the the russians then he could well I mean russia or the soviet union because kruz jaw the leader of the soviet union really liked jfk He thought he was a very good leader I don't think he liked lbj, but the not to get too fucking into that shit But my point is if you look into the jfk, I think there's absolutely zero for a second sure. It's stupid It's honestly stupid if there's also the moon the the moon landing theory. It could have happened. Why not? Explain why if you know why why is it so out of the realm of your understanding that the moon landing? Can't happen. Yeah, you know what's amazing is that that one hoverboard video came out and more people believed that that hoverboard video was real You know what I thought then this fucking Like one of their biggest arguments was yeah, if you take down just standard footage of a guy jumping around and you slow it down to half percent You could tell that they just like they just did that But if you want if you understand animation like you you see the the movement. Yeah, and what's happening. It's also 1969, dude There's also there's also a fucking this is great if you look if you're interested in this kind of stuff You can look up a memo that that Richard Nixon had prepared in case they couldn't come back It was like on this day. We were so these guys died heroes And this was completely reasonable to get somebody to the moon and back people was fucking it was it could have very very easily Going wrong. I feel like especially because recently we were able to land What was it a probe or a satellite on a moving astra? Yeah that you know people could you know I think it seems reasonable. We could land on the stage Yeah, you think yeah, like we're going to mars right now and everyone's like oh No, there's no way you fucking landed on the moon asshole. There are people that are convinced the earth is flat It's not a joke It's like a good number of people who are convinced the earth is flat And then when you go into airplanes the curvature of the earth is the airplane windows being programmed by the government These people are fucking psychos. They think every single aspect of their life I mean I think I think the biggest thing to take away from it is conspiracy theorists don't believe in accidents If you I'm curious I've always one thing I always ask these people is what big event happened in the last 200 years that wasn't planned. They won't tell you anything. They won't give you anything If their brother died in a car accident, it was conspiracy. The government is auditing them. They know what they're doing There's no such thing as access as if they're that's fucking important exactly You know humans do require a certain amount of rationalization the idea that things could happen randomly Without cause I think distressing it's it's it's it's definitely Not to get into this area, but it's religion in some ways You're in this somewhere hold on Oh, so somebody couldn't somebody died and you mean they just died no no there has to be and you started adding this Metaphysical well, there's this all same being right. It's this there's this big entity that controls everything It's god or it's the big government It's it's a way for people who have no control in life to feel like they have control right who feel like there's order or Understand right the world is chaos So if you add this level of like oh the government is is fucking with the cheese and making people They're putting fluoride in the water it makes you feel like there's order and nothing else They have something to kill their time with yeah, exactly But like you'll never see like a like a like a million error conspiracy theorists because all not not the not if you're Look it's curious to theorist your life is bad But I mean there's tests that people who are in less control start adding start seeing things like seeing patterns that aren't there Right, so I mean if you ever if you're it's the first thing people do It's why a lot of unfortunate and poor people start to pray a lot because it's your way of trying to it's your brain Try to manage things and control things and box things up right now somebody is frowning at you and shaking their head Oh blow me Oh, fuck you This guy has no idea what he's talking about all right. Oh tell me oh tell me to watch loose change Tell me how jeffield doesn't melt steel beams. Oh Gray alien reptoid together fluid to the world trade center with jfk's head Yeah, how do you feel about those planes that are up in the sky shooting out noxious fumes? Yeah, yeah, chemtrails the poison they put in the water They're poy the chemtrails are poisoning the angels that god is sending to protect us How do you fall in these angels are dropping like dead birds and landing people's backyards people are grabbing them and fucking them They're keeping them in their house and just fucking these angels Taking their wings off jumping up rooms with these angel wings, but they can't fly because they're not angels You have to have angel wings in your body and a halo The halo's like your battery without the halo you can't fly stop trying to jump off buildings without the fucking halo Thanks, Zach Thanks, you helped a lot of people today jeff on an American spirit sees that you kind of believe that you're like well No

You don't think the Incredible Hulk started pulling out steel beams underneath the 9-11 towers? I'm not one of these people that needs to feel special by believing something, knowing something other people don't know. Jeff, the government did nothing. I think the government is filled with semi-incombinant people who don't know what they're doing. Yeah, I was gonna say, that's why conspiracy theories are...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:40.632 --> 0:39:41.307]: 
  I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:47.955 --> 0:39:51.280]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:38.335 --> 0:43:48.475]: 
  It's like, I guess you are in a certain way, but... I think the more people start to figure out the internet and what it really is, like, we're still in this transitional period where everybody's blown away by everything, because everybody, you're being put in touch by the 43-year-old woman that lives next door to you, and then the dude up the street, so they don't really... There's no defining boundary there. You're all in this fucking room that's not awkward anymore. I don't know, it's interesting like what people appreciate, because I feel like it's all context. People will like give on Reddit, they'll give it like 8,000 ups or whatever, of some guy who took a picture of themselves every day for a year and then strung it all together, but there's some African kid who fucking ate four flies and drank a puddle of mud and survived for four or five years. Well, you gotta admit, he kind of just had it coming. You know, black people, I mean... He chose to be born in Africa. Yeah, I mean, the black guys have had it pretty good for a long time. They kind of get the occasional one-two to the face. Still swinging back? Yeah, they can take it out for a cut once in a while. That's why they need a break, I think. There's a science to making white people XD on the internet, Mick. Yeah, explain it. High-flying. Well, I wanna know this. Jeff, if you, let's say right now, let's say you had no scruples, you didn't care about what anyone's opinion... I'm worried, I hate the word scruples. I was gonna say, what are you fucking about, grandfather? I am not fucking your grandfather. Well, you could. No, but I'm not. All right, continue. No, I was gonna say, if you were to start a channel, and you wanted all the knowledge that you have from looking at Tumblr and watching other YouTube videos, what would be your breakdown of the things you would do to create the most successful YouTube channel ever? I'd blow up stuffed animals there in slow motion. Cute stuffed animals. Have you ever seen that Outschwitz thing? That's a great fucking idea. Outschwitz thing where he like... It is, actually, that would be so popular. Did you see this? Outschwitz thing where he had a tank, and all the videos were crushing stuff at the tank, but it was somehow underwhelming, he was like, Oh, no wait. They got crushed by a tank. I would dress up cats like little soldiers, Okay. And just have explosions going up in the background as they kind of play with each other in the foreground.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:04.204 --> 0:42:04.289]:

  We read that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:20.299 --> 0:46:24.045]: 
  No, he's talking interesting stories from his childhood and stuff like that.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:24.045 --> 0:50:18.912]: 
  I think the most surprising is just that's a shit on another artist, but there's there's bad art There's good art. There's bad art. That's you know still kind of charming. Yeah, he's like Okay, Mark is not a great. Oh, yeah, like he has a really fucking yeah He's really enjoy it. Oh, guys are is bad and not charming Yeah, but it's our son entertaining that's my that's his point tossing this is all subjective This clamor like something on just a random 15 year old a drawing And I think I think there's a charm to itself. Look it's so fucking stupid to look at it's charming I mean, are we are we sounding to am I sounding to be honest? Am I am I coming off to like? No And what a god no you're not because I feel like people you know people rightfully might give me shit because I might get a Little too you're allowed to be cynical nobody's gonna argue whether or not you have you're allowed to have your opinion I think some of the articles are funny And you're like looking at me you're thinking to me like oh what a bitter what a bitter miserable cunt. It's okay It's alright. I agree. No, you're good at Street Fighter and you're an amazing artist You do draw the line when you start telling people that you are wrong for thinking yeah, yeah, that's what that's where the I don't know. I'm not saying that and if I had a fraction of your talent I would probably stop I would probably be bitter as well when I saw shitty shit that you got a Weiner you got a huge Stamper, but he's too it just seems like if you've matched up somebody who's actually funny with an actual decent artist The card game could have been a billion times better But yeah, and then it pulled like it pulled like eight million on I think that's the kicker We got like if I got its gold no one would give a shit, but it got like yeah way over It's just ugly ugly lazy Well, I think that's what goes to I think I think it goes back to that to that like thing like the hype yeah, right? So we got like $1 you'd be like oh, this isn't that bad But if you got like $20 million like what the fuck and it's not even the art that pisses me off the murley them I don't even make me mad just just on top of the fact the humor is so terrible What was well hold on besides the eight million what was he asking for like a couple hundred thousand right? I'm thousand okay Ten thousand and then you got eight million and then I think I'm talented Cotel rider came in said it's work together and I got eight million I see and I think I think like I said that when you see Eight million you go you cross from to go well well well let's see it press me eight million come on Yeah, this better be worth eight million dollars. I think that's what it starts to but I forgot like if it got five dollars You'd be like it's not it's not what I mean. It's not bad You know what I mean? I think it is I think it is the fact that it blows up so much I mean and and then you start to see a lot of the flaws and then you start to try to put the value to it Like this isn't worth eight million dollars. I'm not even trying to attack the guy. I'm just saying I'm just I'm actually just curious What how it got so much? He's got a huge fan base. That's why it's the same thing with the simons cat guy Who ended up coming out with the the cat cartoons or whatever it was he asked? I think for like 350,000 pound which was like 600 thousand plus dollars And I think some people were like dude that for yeah, I think I was one cartoon Yeah, it was kind of like you know not look I was one of the people who said but that also ended up getting a ton more money like over the thing and in some cases when people Ask for an amount and if they happen to have the support and it goes way over You can't necessarily fault the creator but when they're asking for a lot and they get way over even that I feel like that's when I Personally draw the line. I don't know should cut this because just we sound like a bunch of complainers, but it just just kind of blows my mind That's all I just it just seems like there's so many things out there that are so much better Yeah, sure all eight million dollars could do a lot for a lot of other I see Kickstarter's failing all the time that legitimately Interesting talented people are doing wait stop. Are you saying that you'd rather see some Kickstarter's pull through versus a bowl of potato salad?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:25.615 --> 0:46:25.885]: 
  I think it's a good one.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:26.526 --> 0:46:27.792]:

  Yeah, yeah, that, that's what I'm saying.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:43.712 --> 0:47:46.379]:

  government does.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:26.367 --> 0:57:34.658]: 
  Jeff, if you were gonna die that way, right? Like, let's say... Good luck laughing when you're dead, you bitch. Jeff, are you looking forward to old age? Honestly. No. Not even at old age. Like, 60. 60. No. 60. No. 60-year-old Jeff walking around. No. You get discounts. See, you get discounts. I can't wait to be 60. My balls haven't really dropped. Like, I... Jeff, you can be like... I can't wait until I'm 60 and have like, old Sagging Man. I think I'm really... Are you kidding me, Zach? Discounts? Dude, I was at McDonald's today and the old fucks walked up and the aura of death arrived and he was like... He's like... He's really said he's... He's got a discount. Yeah, check this out. He really said he went, See, you got coffee. I was like, oh, what's he talking about? Is that like a dead guy language? No. She was like 60 cents. My coffee was like $2, dude. I'll take youth over my $3 savings at the movie theater. Jeff, how... I'm not going... How would you want to live to be there? What's your ideal... I'm gonna go ask for a fucking handout. I want to hear the answer. He wants his old people handouts. Yes, he asks what's your ideal age to live to. Like, you're not seeing that. You're not shitting your diaper. You could walk. So that depends because, you know, it's been proven... Pretty much proven online. If you're an elderly person, if you're hitting the gym every day, you can be pretty physically healthy for at least into your... Probably the latest, maybe your mid-70s. You can be pretty active. Yeah, you're worried about strokes, sugar. Okay, so I'm saying you're not wheelchair-bound. You're not like... You're not seen out. You're not dying. You're not brain damaged. I mean, I'll just say both my grandfathers, they lived through their early 80s. They still able to walk around. They could do stuff. I can... 90, right? Come on. I mean, the very latest? Yeah, what's your cap? Put a bull in me at... Turn me off at 90. Turn me off at 90. I'll unplug you. All right, people listening to the podcast will remember that because this is now... You see, what about you, Stanford? I'm curious. 47 tops. Oh, stop it. You're gonna be like 56. 47 tops. Yeah, Stanford said he had like four years left when we were... He's been saying that for all these years. Stanford is gonna always be 150 years old. He'll never die. I don't think I'll make it to 90. If you call without any problems. I've seen a lot of things. I've experienced a lot of people. I'm pretty much done with life. I'm good. What about you, Vic? You're Chinese, so you're gonna live to be like a million. Yeah. I think a million would be good. I won't lie. I don't wanna die. I wanna live forever. It's funny, you know, everyone's like... Everybody has his mind set whether like... Like, whether you're 15 or like, yeah, I'll live to be like 25. I don't care if I die. But when you're 25, you're like, yeah, I'll live to be like 40. I don't care. Whether you're 40 or like... But it's weird when you see these old people who are like 80 and they're like, I will live for the 15 years. Yeah. I saw an interview with George Carl like a month before he died. Somebody was asking him like something and his response was like... Dying....to be effective. No, his response was like... He said something to be effective like, oh yeah, all of like another 15, 20 years or whatever, 10, 15 years or whatever. They'd die like a month later and I was like, God damn. Yeah. What do you think of married people who live there? What do you worry so much about death for, Zach? I don't worry about it. I'm just saying like... You're totally worried about it. I don't worry about it. I'm saying people who... Everyone's like, y'all die right now, but like the truth is, even seven-year-old, eight-year-old, nine-year-olds don't want to die. They want to live like another five or ten years. I think the worst part... I'm saying that I will die right now happily. I could... Get the good boys. I could live to that age. I just feel like... These people who are married that live to their 80s and they're like, I'm sh...

  If you could

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:21.775 --> 0:56:23.462]: 
  That wasn't my sound to get to 90.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:12.535 --> 0:57:13.142]: 
  What are you worried about?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:14.155 --> 0:57:16.619]: 
  I'm not worried about it, if you see like... You're totally worried about it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:14.729 --> 0:57:14.948]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:25.343 --> 0:57:25.545]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:34.658 --> 0:57:37.560]: 
  I still in love with my sweet love.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:36.497 --> 0:58:00.443]: 
  They just didn't realize they're too far in. How could you not be fucking sick of that person by the way? Well, you do hear about those cases, those murder cases where it's like some 85 year old man strangled his like 87 year old wife and shit. Who could blame him? What did she do for like 50 years of not pissing him off to the...what brought her to that point?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:39.940 --> 0:57:40.935]: 
  He could be sick with fucking...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:45.374 --> 0:57:46.437]: 
  those cases, those murders.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:52.039 --> 0:57:53.305]: 
  What the fuck?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:00.443 --> 0:58:03.278]: 
  50 years of pissing them off and it was just

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:02.282 --> 1:00:28.639]: 
  Oh, you think that was just like, he walked over slowly? She was like, stop it, dude. He was built up. You do hear about that. You think it poisoned and shit like that? Both of my grandparents, or on one side of my family, they both divorced when they were borderline 80, I want to say. Jesus Christ. And then they both immediately remarried the people they should have been married to their entire lives. Aw. They were married for like 50 years. And then they divorced. And I was like, wow, that's really fucking late to divorce and then join with somebody else. But they're like super psyched and happy now. Do you think they're all dead? I've always thought about this too, though. Do you think by the time you're old, you're kind of upset that nobody wants to fucking over? So I don't think someday you're old. No, but my point is, I think all people fuck other old people, not because they somehow become old people, but it's because it's all you can get. I disagree. I disagree. Yeah, because the older I get, I mean, it's not like I'm looking for fucking 17-year-old. By the time you're 80, you're really going to fuck your 80 and your wife looks like a corpse. No, you don't see it that way. Dude, I won't fuck anybody under 24 right now. It's not happening. Zach, do you know? That's got to do Jell-O shots and fucking... One of the biggest problems for one of the biggest... Why'd you hit 30, though? It's like you're not pretty much an adult, right? One of the biggest issues that a lot of these assisted living compounds has is the spread of STDs among the elderly. Because they fuck like crazy ass monkeys. The guy's not gonna lose anymore. I'm not saying that he'll fuck, but I'm saying like, if a 20-year-old walked in and was like, I want to suck your dick, oh man, he would do it. Yeah. So... I'm just saying he would not appreciate an elderly's saggy veiny boobs. He could still enjoy those. I think there's a cap. Yeah, I think... You guys would say like 30 or 40 old ladies, but that's like... No, you're working with your current mindset, thinking about fucking an old... You're thinking about current... Dude, I would go older. Fucking an old woman. I would go older. He probably would as well. How old would you go? Why are... How old would you go? No, you first. How old would you go? 60s. I'd do hot 50. Oh, you guys are such pussies. I would say a hot 60-year-old. You're 50s. You fucking hypocrite. I'm not a hypocrite. I'm not 50 yet. When I get 50, I'll probably say 70. When you're 95, you're gonna be like, oh, bring me that fucking Jeepers Creepers body. Bring me that fucking body corpse. This wasn't a contest to see who was the creepiest dude in terms of wanting to fuck old ladies. Jeff, would you fuck up with body corpse?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:22.836 --> 0:58:24.135]: 
  They were married

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:52.502 --> 0:58:53.937]: 
  I disagree

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:53.937 --> 0:58:55.759]: 
  I disagree.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:58.493 --> 0:58:59.742]: 
  Yeah, but dude, but

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:02.594 --> 0:59:04.517]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:12.499 --> 0:59:14.220]: 
  What are the biggest problems?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:13.967 --> 0:59:14.389]: 
  Don't you hit the...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:15.975 --> 0:59:17.072]:

  I'm

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:24.936 --> 0:59:26.472]:

  No you're not.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:55.379 --> 0:59:57.437]: 
  I would, I would fucking an old woman.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:00.205 --> 1:00:02.027]: 
  You're a liar. How old did you go?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:14.684 --> 1:00:15.156]: 
  What are you doing?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:26.513 --> 1:00:26.564]: 
  MBC 뉴스 이덕영입니다.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:30.310 --> 1:00:31.086]: 
  No, I wouldn't.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:30.327 --> 1:00:30.495]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:32.453 --> 1:01:08.970]: 
  I like them right when they clock over to 18. I sit and wait. I'm waiting by the DMV every day. Waiting for bitches to come out with their license so they can drive me someplace and blow me. Speaking of old people, I'm curious, how would you guys want to die if you had to go out? They gave you a choice. They'd say, hey, you're going to die, but we're going to give you a choice. How do you want to go? Any choice? Any choice. I'd like to, anything. You could just stamp or ride into a warehouse full of drug dealers with guns blazing. You could do that. There. Alright. Okay, let's hear what you say.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:37.077 --> 1:00:39.439]: 
  I'm waiting by the- You got your watch! I- I'm waiting by the-

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:10.152 --> 1:03:35.901]: 
  It was more interesting, right? We have guns too, right? Yeah. So we can kill as many people as we need. Okay, yeah, okay, I'll take that. You're just in another situation, right? You're walking down the street, a car fucking hits you, you're dying. You're splitting the half, and then you're gonna die. You have honestly like a minute left. You could go cold. Because the guy who hits you is like, oh, he's freaking out, right? You can tell this guy your last words, be like, tell everybody this was my last, this was my last word, my last request. I'll say this. Jokes aside, I would hands down honestly say, tell the world Psychic Pebbles is a faggot. And he would go up to somebody and be like, he said just tell the world Psychic Pebbles is a faggot. I'd be like, just get trend, make sure Psychic Pebbles is a faggot, trend some Twitter. Put a hashtag. Hashtag. Hashtag. He's like, I don't know what that means. And you'll never know what it means, but I just said it because I had nothing better to say. And it'll ruin your life. I wanna come off stage, I wanna come off stage from the Oscars with 18 Oscars in my arms for a cartoon I made with my friends that won like best animation. I wanna go backstage. I wanna have the hottest fucking superstar woman female lead who just won her Oscar for leading actress. Huge, give me a fucking blow job. And while that's happening, right when I fucking come, someone put a gun to the back of my head and blow my brains out. Love Bill Cabeute style. Is that how they did it? Spoilers. Oh. Let's do it again. Three, two, one. Spoilers. Okay, oh, spoilers. Three, two, one. Spoilers. There you go, that's good. Here's a morbid question. Let's say your entire family was wiped out by like a drunk driver. The drunk driver lived. Yes. And he was fine. Okay. And you decided to write him a letter. That driver was me, I fucking killed myself. Yeah, would you be the forgiveness type of person or the angry one? I think, honestly, I have a threshold. I think I have a threshold where somebody did silly horrible, that's what I mean, I just wouldn't care. Like I dedicated my life to him. It's too much, yeah. I'd be the forgiveness guy, true. I would, I absolutely would. Because what else can I fucking do at that point? I would, you know what? I would probably beat the shit out of him. Okay, okay, okay. Kick the crap out of someone who like kicked my dog. If somebody kicked my dog, I would go over to their house, I would pull their kids out of the school bus as they got home and I'd fucking bash their heads in the back. That scenario's got variables though. I'd have to talk to the guy first. Let's do it this way, let's do it this way. I might forgive him. The drunk driver, it's the fucking, what's the genre of the Brooklyn movie where the dude kills his family? 300.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:34.890 --> 1:01:35.751]: 
  I'll say this.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:46.990 --> 1:01:47.530]: 
  I'd be like...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:36.484 --> 1:02:36.501]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:37.109 --> 1:02:37.530]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:49.377 --> 1:02:50.001]: 
  That driver was

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:50.001 --> 1:02:51.452]: 
  was me I fucking kill my

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:51.452 --> 1:02:51.824]: 
  Yeah, we do.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:54.996 --> 1:02:58.017]: 
  I think I honestly think I have a

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:01.847 --> 1:03:04.682]: 
  It's too much.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:03.501 --> 1:03:03.771]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:09.981 --> 1:03:10.065]: 
  I'll see you next time.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:10.538 --> 1:03:11.669]: 
  You know what?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:13.204 --> 1:03:13.542]: 
  Okay, okay.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:21.490 --> 1:03:22.907]: 
  Скоба!

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:24.932 --> 1:03:30.501]: 
  That scenario's got variables. I'd have to talk to the guy first. Let's do it this way. I might forgive him.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:30.096 --> 1:03:30.450]: 
  forget

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:30.501 --> 1:03:30.923]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:38.027 --> 1:04:50.050]: 
  I'm a law-abiding citizen. What if it's a law-abiding citizen thing where you're at home, some do eating dinner. Make sure you watch Law-abiding Citizen to get the forever. It's like the first one. There's a home invasion. Yes. Yeah, so it's a home invasion. You're sitting there eating with your family. It doesn't mean you could be your kids, your wife. It could be your aunts and uncles, brother and sisters. Those guys are gonna die. Yeah, no, yeah. The way it happened in that movie, yeah. They're gonna die. How would you do it though, honestly? How would I kill them? What letter would I write? Kill them, what would you do? I could probably do what Gerard Butler did. You think he would do that? Close. I could do close to what he did minus a lot of the scientifics and planning. Yeah, I was gonna be like, I don't know if anyone could really do what he did. Actually, no, dude, he fucking, he put poison to do the barrel of a cup. If he was a guy that took no remorse and he was like glad he killed everybody I knew, I could definitely time down to a table and do terrible things. Oh yeah, I could. Yeah. Because you're gonna die anyways. You do it. I'd scoop his eyes out with a spoon. You know what I always thought was a real torture idea, but I was never done it? Place somebody on their back in a time to where a table they could flip over, like so their stomach is facing the floor. But cut a little hole where their stomach is, and it cuts right, and then put them over like that so it all comes out.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:39.344 --> 1:03:39.951]: 
  Bye bye.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:44.811 --> 1:03:48.996]: 
  It's a much law-abiding citizen to get there forever. It's like the first bite. It's a home invasion. Yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:59.239 --> 1:03:59.779]: 
  The way...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:00.825 --> 1:04:01.450]: 
  They're gonna die.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:18.274 --> 1:04:18.443]: 
  that

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:18.747 --> 1:04:20.502]: 
  No, don't eat fucking, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:31.892 --> 1:04:32.449]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:32.449 --> 1:04:35.031]: 
  Because you're gonna die anyways, you knew it was coming.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:36.314 --> 1:04:38.271]: 
  You literally thought it was a really torturing idea.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:51.045 --> 1:05:50.867]: 
  What the hell is your problem? Let me see what you're thinking about it. It's so much cut your line, you can do that. Jesus man. If I cut a hole in your stomach and flipped you over, your guts probably wouldn't fall out like a cartoon, Zach. Hit him on the back like a bar. Like you're trying to get salt out of my jaw. Yeah, yeah. The hind's ketchup cup. Bastionately hard, man. I mean, that happens with dogs if they get hit by a car there. Oh, everything spills out, yeah. Gosh. I don't know if I told you, did I tell the story about my neighbor's dog and got hit by a suburban? Yeah. He's a big pit bull. Yeah. His intestines were hanging out. He still walked back. They sewed him back up and he was okay. Yeah. Yeah. I have a similar story where I was driving to the Newgrounds office when I lived up north and I was on the interstate and I saw this flash in my rear view mirror and it was animalized on the side of the road and I was like, oh shit. So I got back off the interstate because I was like, oh, that dog might be alive. Right. Or whatever the fuck it is, might be alive. And so I went back and then I pulled up next to the dog and then I walked up to, I parked my car and I walked up to him. I was like, you okay, buddy? And I put my hand on his rib cage. You know, his eyes cold.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:03.584 --> 1:05:07.296]: 
  Like a Heinz ketchup cup.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:11.532 --> 1:05:13.489]: 
  Oh, everything spills out, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:19.075 --> 1:05:19.260]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:21.775 --> 1:05:22.197]: 
  Nessouro...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:22.669 --> 1:05:23.800]: 
  It was okay.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:51.644 --> 1:07:22.279]: 
  And I was like, oh god. I thought you were saying like he caved in. Well, no. But then I looked to the right and all his guts were hanging out of his ass. It was the worst fucking day of that entire year. Yeah, when the dog or what? And then it came back later on to drive back home. And it was just like this bloody scrape on the ground. So some guys just came by and scooped him up with a snow shovel and threw him in the fucking trash. It was awful. It was awful. You know there's no coming back when you see some road kill. Some of them look like they might be able to make it. You know, like they've got their little kind of crooked, you know, like they're clearly. It's so easy to get CPR at a time they could have made. Maybe. But other times, you know, it's just wrong when like they kind of look whole, but literally like they got run over right in the middle and their guts. It's not like with the dog where they can put it back in. I mean, they're like shooting out their eye sockets. Like they're done. Yeah, he looked like straight like from like 75% of his body. I was like, oh, hey, I've never touched a creature that was just like an ice cold. It was fucked up. Yeah. I've talked about this before, but I saw. I came out three minutes, like a minute after a deer is hitting in front of me. That was one of my favorite stories. Oh my God. Creepy, that whole thing must have looked. All four legs are broken, flan around. That absolutely looks like something from Silent Hill. It's a fucking nightmare. That's absolutely like a Silent Hill like creature, like a mini boss. We could just stand there and hope the thing died. Because that flailing deer has antlers. Yeah, and you got to make sure it doesn't flail at you. You're like trying to run away from it because it's just limbs and hooves and antlers. And it's a mini, but it's got the normal music. It doesn't have like a boss music. Right. It's got like the sub boss music.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:24.094 --> 1:06:25.124]: 
  I think that's not right!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:26.288 --> 1:06:27.807]: 
  Maybe, but other times.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:38.421 --> 1:06:38.472]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:44.884 --> 1:06:45.492]: 
  I school

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:45.492 --> 1:06:46.892]: 
  It was fucked up, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:54.655 --> 1:06:55.887]: 
  CH resil찬

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:01.422 --> 1:07:02.249]: 
  It was a fucking nightmare.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:08.138 --> 1:07:08.610]: 
  Because that's...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:08.610 --> 1:07:10.298]: 
  flailing deer has antlers.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:22.870 --> 1:07:38.462]: 
  And yeah, like I said the only nice part of that whole service some guy came by Within like 20 minutes and bees was like hey you're gonna eat that and he threw it in the back of his truck Yeah, see to me that's a happy ending. Yeah, I would have that would have been me dude I would have been like yeah, I'll eat this thing. I'll give this thing a memorial in my belly

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:30.599 --> 1:07:32.944]: 
  Yeah, see to me that's a happy ending.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:32.944 --> 1:07:33.197]: 
  That was it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:33.889 --> 1:07:34.598]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:38.429 --> 1:07:40.184]: 
  in your toilet

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:40.184 --> 1:13:00.741]: 
  Moving on Zach you were just Chastising me because I pay for TV. Well, I would say that nobody has TV like nobody watches cable television cable Nobody watches. All right. Look, what do you mean? Nobody is the thing No, but okay, we will clarify nobody that nobody that I guarantee a lot of our listeners don't watch TV Unless you like live with your family or you lived with the room. I guarantee a lot of our listeners do listen to I'm genuinely curious On the internet you swear nobody watches to everybody's like Because we don't even pay for like to I don't know it's not that we pay for don't watch it We don't even pay for TV because by the time anything comes out. I have Netflix. I mean, that's that's what I use I think I think I pay for Netflix. Yeah, but you can also go and watch any show you want to with TV I had to watch TV when I went when I went to my parents house last winter whatever It was it was awkward to get because it was the first time I watched TV You know what to play the Who's supposed to be watched TV step honestly sat down to watch TV at a bar, but at the same time I play by I was asked to be watched TV your house. We don't have TV at our house exactly fucking boy Let's take the same one at the same time I have Netflix at my house and what I have to watch fucking leprechaun to and the fucking exorcist nine It doesn't people have TV for a reason and the TV is still very important and what you are Putting it on for like, you know, I'll put on his background noise or like I'll just put on the food network Or yeah, but you pay so much for that for a month though. Well, Zach. I'm not starving. I can afford it So you really want to afford listening to still old bitches? I feel like I feel like there's some I feel empty inside of it. I didn't have TV for some reason access to it I just got used to it Maybe I want to watch it just find a line to find a balance I was sitting home eating bugs and watching Netflix and I like my waist $50 a month. It's more than that See I was paying like $120 a month for my cable TV TV you don't watch well No, here's the thing like if I think there's a balance you you could find where you're paying for a lot of channels You don't watch like me and Jeff watch Discovery history the foot network Maybe Cartoon Network, whatever so why isn't there a fucking TV package where I could just like click the shows that I or that's a Technically right like with the DVR you can yeah, but aren't you still paying a flat fee for everything? It's about you should be able to subscribe to the channels you actually want I'm not even I'm gonna say anybody's in fear of what you do you see I didn't know that anybody's so you're the only person I know that still watches TV and pays for TV, you know besides besides my family the thing that I find like the entirety of my No, the thing I find most interesting about like today's audiences though And the reason why I think TV is becoming more and more obsolete is that we want our we want our shows and we want our Entertainment instantly and we want it specifically we don't want to have to wait through cheap not just the commercials Yeah, and it's not just the commercials. It's also that your show is there You know what I mean like you don't have to wait until 6 p.m. Eastern time every Tuesday Not testing out a new show plus commercial. That's the biggest thing that when I went back to visit my family I was like I was going through the TV guide and there was nothing on so the gloves I'm just not gonna want I can't watch anything. I'm just gonna sit here like an idiot. It's true That's so you I would rather look at my Twitter feed and talk to friends then watch some show I didn't want like you know desperate housewives. I torrent TV shows Yeah, so you do get to watch the shows that you want when you I've never torn it shit like video games I just grabbed shows every now that I miss the tour view. Will you try to say that like that was justifying it like Yeah, I'm not one of those guys. I'm one of the good torrentors I'm not a good person. I'm just I only murder white people Yeah, I'm not a racist. I don't murder black people. I'm only half Yeah, no, I don't know why that This fucking came Things you pay for like I have HBO go I pay for that I legit. I don't see that seems like a fighter That seems great though because there's lots of shows and movies that I watch only get access from there You can watch any sort of issue you want to for that so that has HBO. That's on each but that's not cable though HBO goes Can't afford anymore. Yeah, but then I know people it's like the same concept when people like yeah fuck ps4 I'm never gonna spend that much money on a fucking game console and then they'll go out and buy a video card for like $800 is the same concept. I know people like fuck cable TV and they'll buy a hulu account and Netflix account a fucking HBO Go which is all less expensive than fucking cable though, dude I not have you had them all no that looks is a box. I'll just be a good job. Oh, that's like 20. I mean it comes with HBO You have to get a first 20 bucks. Yeah, it's like 20 bucks. So it's like yeah You have the option you could like pull up Netflix and watch fucking Child's play 9 and look the tooth fairy starring the rock if you're one of these people who love him They're pretty much there They're the what they oh they own a desk a computer in a computer chair and all they do is sit there and watch Netflix in Torned movies all day then fine. You do that plus you have a TV what wasting 50 bucks a month though in the back Sitting in my living room. What's TV truthfully what truthfully people that have like gable TV?

  You

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:01.703 --> 1:14:26.466]: 
  So it's like, TV is their recreation. Everybody that I know that uses Netflix doesn't use it the way the normal person does. Everybody I know that uses Netflix and Hulu and all that shit, they put it on as background noise for when they're working. So it's pseudo entertainment in the background. You're not sitting down and like watching it. Cable TV is a constant feed of things that tons of people pay for for a reason. Okay, yeah, and here's the one big plus to cable television, Zach Arie, okay? Sports? Fuck sports. No, the, well, if you want to say fuck sports and cable TV doesn't exist anymore. No, what I'm saying is if you have a DVR set up, right? Yeah. Like I know that there are certain shows that only, like if I want to watch them on Netflix a week or two weeks later, maybe, sometimes a month later with like Game of Thrones or some shit like that. One hour after they are online. From what, you can't do that with like any problems. Absolutely can. Yes, you just can't. If I want to be a fucking thief and a little shit and I've got my ad block on and I'm fucking jacking off in my diaper, like a fucking hat. I'm starving here. You're making money while you're paying for $50. I'm starving to pay for friends. Oh, Jeff, I pay $100 a month to have some guy come in. I'm not paying for anything. Zach, Zach, did you pay for flash? Did you pay for flash? Let's pay, Zach actually did once. You know what, you know something this is true. I tore it to three different versions of flash. The one actually bought for $800, the one time I ever paid for it. It was broken. That's why I tore it's stuff. You know, Zach, you're part of the entitled generation. Oh, you've done shit too, Jeff.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:45.055 --> 1:13:46.827]: 
  Game of Thrones or some shit like that.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:59.230 --> 1:13:59.415]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:22.011 --> 1:14:22.770]: 
  He knows it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:24.374 --> 1:14:24.475]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:27.090 --> 1:15:23.031]: 
  I need air! I'm Jeff! I don't pay for anything! I haven't bought Flash Photoshop! I did buy Flash! Liar! Thank you! Yeah, 2002 you liar! That's not true. I am such a good- I bought the copy of Flash, I'm so good at it. I am such a supporter of independent artists that I purchase songs off of iTunes and Bandcamp. Have you ever tried to do anything before? Oh yeah, that's right. But Mick is always shoving his Bandcamp songs in our face. Sorry, I love music. And I love to support artists who work hard. That's fine! I see that! Who can't just taunt their guitars. Who actually have to buy guitars and then make beautiful music for us. I bought out of love Bandcamp. I've definitely bought these off iTunes. I bought them off of iTunes. I see a band. I see a band. Why don't you do anything? The last thing I bought was the Ninja Sex Parties album. I went to support some friends, I went to support some artists. Yeah, Ninja Sex Parties album was great. And then you also, did you get the Starbomb album? No, I didn't buy that. Did you get the second one? No. You know there's a third one coming. I didn't buy any of them. Why didn't you buy any of them?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:14:28.491 --> 1:14:29.234]: 
  I had to pick

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:36.540 --> 1:14:38.700]: 
  I am such a good...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:46.463 --> 1:14:46.598]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:01.634 --> 1:15:03.962]: 
  and then make beautiful music for us.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:23.031 --> 1:15:24.904]: 
  Why didn't you buy it, Zach?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:15:25.005 --> 1:15:50.993]: 
  Because they don't like the music. I don't like it. I like everybody involved. What? I have to like everything all my friends make? Yes! I get a ton of videos I made you guys hate. What video game would you like them to rap about next? Call a blind RPG. I don't know dude. What do kids play these days? I don't- Do you think your friends are good rappers? I'm not keeping any of this. Aw, bomber.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:15:51.786 --> 1:16:11.985]: 
  I thought I was a pretty good rapper for a little bit. Stamper is the best one. Until you fucking just... Wait, you want to start a ball? That you just destroyed me. No, he meant rapper in general. He said which one of your friends are the best rappers and you just shot me down. Stamper's alright. Stamper rap about apples. Yo, I like apples. You gotta... Uh, you guys just cut the...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:54.014 --> 1:15:54.638]: 
  Stamper is dead.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:56.393 --> 1:15:59.852]: 
  Wait, you want to star below? No, he meant rapper in general.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:03.902 --> 1:16:04.797]: 
  Step is alright.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:03.953 --> 1:16:03.987]:

I know it's not the best movie, but it's what he's in the fucking- Did that just rhyme with what I said? Now my pee pee is bleeding. Did you ever see that scene from Scary Movie 3? It's not bad, but keep going. I'm talking about the cut bridge by the way. You can still sound like a- Whoa! Did it sound like a rap? Yeah. It worked. Okay. Anyways.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:55.776 --> 1:16:56.164]: 
  Not bad.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:11.622 --> 1:17:12.752]: 
  I'm so sorry.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:17:12.752 --> 1:17:14.237]: 
  Did it sound like a...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:17:15.216 --> 1:17:15.942]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:22.169 --> 1:18:22.007]: 
  Let's see what we're talking about. We never talked about showers. High school. High school showering in high school. Oh yeah, you guys brought this up earlier. What were you talking about? High school. Yeah, what? Hey, you fucking goof. BING! BING! BING! Locker room, my dick is small. In the shower room, stong! When you guys got to high school. Everyone points and laughs. Cause my dick is small. Wait, you already said that. Cause my dick is stuck in my ass. No. You guys got to high school. I tried. What's that? When you guys got to high school, you had your first day of gym class, did the gym teacher say you got a big wide open shower room where you're all dreading the public shower? No, see my gym teacher always said, hey, go fucking take a shower or whatever you need to do. And he was just working off a mindset from the fucking 70s, but we had stand up showers that nobody ever used. I was gonna say what he said. Nobody ever used. Everyone just stank. Everybody, everybody built schools like you. Everyone sprayed cologne all over them. You do the French shower. Yeah. Right.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:51.615 --> 1:17:52.172]: 
  I tried.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:18:14.481 --> 1:18:16.017]: 
  ever used. Everyone just stank.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:18:18.599 --> 1:18:23.324]: 
  That would be the French shower. Yeah, go ahead. Sorry.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:18:23.324 --> 1:20:26.224]: 
  I was just gonna add one little footnote to what Stanford said. Yeah, at middle school, everyone was like, dude, you have to get the high school showers. Everyone's gonna put their finger up your ass and call you gay and stuff. I was like, oh no. But I went there and nobody ever used a shower. Only one freaky kid would smell. The weird kids used a shower. It was also like the Russian import that used the shower. Yeah, yeah. Like the kid that wasn't used to Americans. Who'd walk in there, just dropped turns casually in the floor. As he walked around and showered, yeah. You don't shit in the shower. And smelled the rest of the day. Everybody had X showers. You'd spray yourself with X. But your gym clothes would be in a little locker that you'd keep there. And man, every time you opened that locker, it was like a bomb went off. I thought I had a long way before that. I didn't do very good in gym. So I still didn't need to work. Oh, you never broke a sweat. Dude, here's how it went in my gym class. We had a big open shower room that was like, the whole room was like one big room with the showers. The gym coach pretty much stood in the middle of the room and he's like, he stood there with his fucking clipboard and he made sure every guy in there, he's like, if you don't take a shower, you're getting docked points. I'm docking you. Dude, yeah, we're faggots. Oh my god. Oh, you said pussy. He's easy to call him gay, but he was definitely like, he was like some crazy war veteran. He did not seem gay, no matter. He could stand there and watch nude boys all day long. He could have his dick in your butt and he would not be gay. So he just sits there and like scrutinizes you while you're clean. And he's like, clean out your foreskin. Make sure it's really clean. And then you just go to math class and everything's fine. I think he's fine. Put that soap down, son. I'm going to show you how it's done. As long as you make it to under a shower head, he counted you. But did any boy ever guard his penis with his hands? Yeah, they were definitely bashful ones. They would play with fuck with each other. Some kid told me to drop the soap in front of me and told me to pick it up. I didn't fall for it, but then the kid next to me fell for it. What happened? He got scolded. Was it a prison? Everybody just started fucking with him. Like, you're like, oh, you picked up the soap. He used me to consume. You wouldn't last a day in the big house. Yeah, something like that. Did they ever make fun of your curly pigtail wiener?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:18:41.093 --> 1:18:41.515]: 
  It was awesome.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:43.557 --> 1:18:46.088]: 
  Like, in a kid that wasn't used to American and stuff.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:18:49.564 --> 1:18:51.404]: 
  You don't shit in the showers.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:50.543 --> 1:18:51.049]: 
  Go!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:52.163 --> 1:18:53.260]: 
  That's the way we do it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:55.184 --> 1:18:56.145]: 
  Yeah, but you're just

 SPEAKER_00 [1:18:57.985 --> 1:19:00.499]: 
  that you keep there. Man, every time you open that lock,

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:00.499 --> 1:19:02.524]: 
  It was like a bomb went off

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:09.173 --> 1:19:10.169]: 
  It's Vernal alone to him.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:24.209 --> 1:19:24.445]: 
  Amen.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:24.445 --> 1:19:24.968]: 
  Тебе не сад пойдем,願い.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:31.431 --> 1:19:34.772]: 
  I wouldn't, it's easy to follow him. Oh you said, it's easy to follow him again.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:32.005 --> 1:19:32.494]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:42.839 --> 1:19:43.868]: 
  He can have his dick in your...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:45.420 --> 1:19:45.960]: 
  It's so...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:51.192 --> 1:19:51.327]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:53.082 --> 1:19:57.250]: 
  and everything's fine? Put that soap down son. I'm gonna show you how it's done. It leaves a fucking...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:56.440 --> 1:19:57.233]: 
  Please Kingdom

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:28.452 --> 1:20:37.277]: 
  Ha! You do have a curly big tail there. Big girl! A curly fry? I walked into the shower holding it out straight and I'm like... Straight! Yeah, look at you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:32.097 --> 1:20:34.004]: 
  There you go. That's right.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:38.982 --> 1:22:19.945]: 
  The whole podcast was leading up to this moment. I just wanted to It was all a ruse to find out about your curly fry weiner Ducks do ducks at curly. Yeah, they do. Oh, yeah, you know, I know ducks have corkscrew weeners They look like wine wine bottle openers. No pigtails. They stop at a second So it's saying that somebody has a pigtail weiner is comical because it's short anchor Ringo but then a Ducks weiner is like nine feet long and it spirals Equally comedic honestly, I'm the last person that wants to talk about dicks more in this fucking podcast But I'll say this animal dicks are almost like magic Nothing to two feet long and back to nothing and they're always strange shapes as well. Yeah, yeah That's kind of like my dick though. I mean it's about an inch long when it's soft over it's hard They just get they turn in Roller I am Asians mostly are actually Asians don't really I'm backwards when my dick normally when it's flaccid is like nine feet long when I'm hard It's it contracts back into your body. It's like two inches hard It's like one of those it's like if you took a worm and you stretch it really thin But when you let go of it when it comes back together there the girth like it gets shorter But it's girth is really no yeah, it contracts like something out of the cosmos it like focuses in on it The power Yes, like a new trial just like the powers there and then it's like the worst hammer Like it's only about you know four inches long, but literally it could collapse a star in an old

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:43.521 --> 1:20:45.799]: 
  Make sure everyone knows what I mean.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:51.857 --> 1:20:52.380]: 
  I hope that

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:52.380 --> 1:20:53.157]: 
  Ducks, dude.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:02.016 --> 1:21:02.505]: 
  So it's a no.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:04.767 --> 1:21:05.442]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:32.492 --> 1:21:34.079]: 
  It's hard. It's like two people.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:35.057 --> 1:21:36.002]: 
  You throw that shit.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:46.262 --> 1:21:47.444]: 
  Good trek.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:50.700 --> 1:21:52.540]: 
  No, it's like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:52.540 --> 1:21:53.114]: 
  One of those, it's...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:22:05.669 --> 1:22:09.044]: 
  The density of your dick. The power is...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:22:13.988 --> 1:22:14.747]: 
  Or is Hammer-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:19.540 --> 1:22:21.582]: 
  It only works when Odin whispers it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:22:21.582 --> 1:22:40.279]: 
  The only person who can jack it off this fucking door would you be with the chick if she was really into whispering to the guys they calls She's like hey, I tell you see me be like you put your ear be like what's up? And she's like no no no she'd go down be like she was a giggling stuff Would you feel subconscious and then my dick lies at her like the war and she grabs it?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:24.974 --> 1:22:25.952]: 
  It's fucking stored.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:37.056 --> 1:22:38.187]: 
  And then my dick flies at her like...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:22:40.870 --> 1:24:13.007]: 
  Jeff is loving this. I've seen weird or shit. No, that fly in the bedroom, you know what I'm saying? There's a lot of weird fetishes out there, though. I don't get the ones that are like, we're going to do them once, like the death fetishes. How is that a fetish? That's the ultimate fetish. Is it the desire? But it's not the death, though. It's the desire to have death. I guess, but there are people who actually do it. Like, there's that guy who has penis cut off and died. Yeah. What was his actual fetish, though? Yeah. To have his penis cut off and die. I don't know, man. I guess that. I don't know. I feel like his fetish was attention. I mean, it's hard, I mean, because he did it on camera. There's a lot of people that their fetishes are attention. I mean, you look at the fucking paint Olympics, that a dude lays his balls and dick across the cutting board. I'm sure that was fake. And smashes it with, no. Well, maybe a couple of them. But he'll just lay his dick and balls out and then he'll hatch them with the hatchet and then cut them with the smash. Those guys have to immediately regret that. Well, yeah, but you know, they get their 15 minutes of fame. And you know, that's what they wanted the whole time. Yeah, but it's like, you can't really exploit that any way except for that. And you think a walk would be like, yeah. In your mind, do you think a fetish is something that you have to constantly revisit, like getting choked while you're... No, I mean, kind of... When I think of fetish, I do think it's consistent. Like, it's an addiction. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can only ever do that once. So what's that? Like a super fetish? I don't know, man. I don't know what that would be. It's stupid as what it is. It's a goal. It's a life goal. Have you been... Name something that a girl has asked you to do when you've been with her that you were just completely uncomfortable with? I never got the choking thing. Yeah. The choking is a cover, but I was just like, I've always afraid that, you know, they're gonna request me to be hard. You're gonna crush their fucking... What if I could kill them? You can't...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:41.511 --> 1:22:42.456]: 
  I've seen you do this.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:22:55.180 --> 1:22:55.349]: 
  It's

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:55.349 --> 1:22:56.564]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:28.778 --> 1:23:28.964]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:29.605 --> 1:23:30.803]:

  In your name.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:44.860 --> 1:23:46.952]: 
  No. When I think of fetish, I do think it's

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:48.049 --> 1:23:48.437]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:48.437 --> 1:23:49.298]: 
 哎呀哎呀

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:56.234 --> 1:23:56.723]: 
  goal

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:13.007 --> 1:24:14.577]: 
  kill somebody that easy.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:14.661 --> 1:26:05.361]: 
  I don't know, maybe my penis is rounding me up so much that I question that we might be killed. That does seem like a thing you would do, accidentally. Yeah, it's my luck to kill somebody while... I just imagine you naked and your wiener flopping around the dead body on the bed and you're like, what do I do? What do I do? That's the worst part. Like running around in the bedroom. The worst part would be like, do I finish? And you say I finished before it happened? You know what I mean? You mean finish having sex? Yeah, come and be like, oh, I didn't tell the country no, no, no, no. It happened before she died. It happened as she... What do you think the law is on that? Because I have been asked by multiple people to choke them while we're having sex. Now let's say they die. Do I go to jail? How hard are you choking people? No, I'm not... Look, I'm not saying I... You killed someone. I never... I haven't ever killed... Where are they billed, Nick? I'm asking what would happen if someone did that they were asked by their partner. This is a submissive mindset and you're like going in there with both hands trying to kill them. At best you're charged with second degree murder and you'd go to jail. Yeah. But do you think the cops would believe you? Or they just thought like... It wouldn't matter. Why are you choking them to death? It wouldn't matter. It wouldn't matter. Because you're like, oh, oh, your head slipped. What if they just keep screaming harder and harder and they're like, oh, oh, oh, oh. Even if it was a video, the person like, harder. Yeah. You still, your head still killed somebody. You'd still probably go to jail. No, I suppose as soon as their eyes started bugging out and they like passed out, that would be kind of your cue to be like, let go and then maybe do some mouth to mouth. You'd probably knock somebody out before you killed them. Yeah. You probably actually would, I think. If their eyes started bugging out, I'd just pull my hands up, come on, I'm a runaway. Yeah. But you can do that anyway. You do that at the playground. Dude, you did that last Thursday and you blamed it on Mick. Yeah. He's like a dog. It's easy to do. Zach was up in a tree just whacking off the kids on the teeter totter. Someone thought it was brooching. They're like, oh, gross. How do you whack off on a teeter totter? From a tree. You just whack off.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:24:19.572 --> 1:24:19.656]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:25:29.620 --> 1:25:31.493]:

  before you kill them.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:25:46.124 --> 1:25:49.887]: 
  Yeah, but you can do that anyway. You can do that at the playground. Dude, you did that last...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:25:51.659 --> 1:25:52.064]: 
  Yeah.
