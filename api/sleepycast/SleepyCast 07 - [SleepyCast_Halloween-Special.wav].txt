 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:01.838 --> 0:01:02.209]: 
  Thank you very much.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:08.959 --> 0:01:09.600]: 
  I love you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:10.866 --> 0:01:10.917]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:16.570 --> 0:01:16.755]: 
  Wow.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:22.932 --> 0:04:19.377]: 
  Okay, I just wanted to get that on my system. God, the Jews change colors and fall out of trees. They fall out of trees and triple up and come back to the spring. No, they fall out of trees and ovens and burn. You know, they burn through the leaves. You guys have always been very festive about Halloween. I'm festive. You guys are the most festive, grab all of these. No, listen, I'm festive. You always dress up as Superman. You got really excited last year. I've worn a Christmas sweater. You actually dress up like Superman. You're like, I'm strong. Technicality. You actually came to my house and you started getting kids' treats and kissing on the forehead and patting them away. I came over and you guys were so excited. You had like 30 bags of candy. You were ready to hand them out to a bunch of little trick or treaters. Dude, we did Halloween fucking. Nice, man. You did. Except nobody came to the door. You went and told me what you did last year. You went to the door and you said, we don't have any treats. We don't have any. We're having a kiss from old Jeff down the street. You kiss him on the head and you say, don't tell your parents. You speak to only from Jeff. You're a liar. You're a liar. How about we stop telling lies? How about we tell the truth? You're a liar. You're a liar. You're a liar. You're a stranger than fiction. That's what I say. Jeff, what happened on that paper light one year ago? So the door rang one time late, late at night after everybody kind of gave up and I was the only one kind of near the door and I'm like, all right guys, here we go. Time to get in the spirit of Halloween. You're a fucking liar. You were not that peppy. That's true. Jeff, you just got the door. You just got the dance. So I swung open the door and there was one little black girl. It really wasn't even that little. She was more like a teenager. Why don't you say one little girl? Yeah, Jeff. What's the deal? I don't see color, Jeff. I don't know. Well, she wasn't giving me the fuck me out, Zach. No, yes. I'll tell you, she was black. It's Philadelphia. There was a black girl. So the girl's at the door. She's at the door. Give me the fuck. No, she wasn't wearing a costume because I don't know. I guess she had a frown on her face and she's like, hey, give me candy or something like that. So these kids, these kids that go around on Halloween without a costume and just sort of want candy anyways without having to put it in the effort. Very cynically go door to door begging for candy without any effort involved whatsoever. Because they don't have money? No, they just don't give a fuck. They just want to get it for candy. Yeah, they just don't give a fuck. They want you to put it in your effort, not put it in your effort themselves. And I just kind of frowned at her and gave her three bags and... Three bags of candy? We had like 80 of them. Yeah, we had the shit load. And she was like the only trick or treat or two. And I just said, get lost. We got one more trick or treat and it was like this little girl in a princess costume and her pops was there and he was like super psyched that we gave her a bunch of candy and we were really happy. When you were kids, you never had those houses on the street that used to just put out a big bowl of candy and fucking bail for the night and there was like always one kid on the street. You'd be like, take one piece and there was one ass that was like, fuck it. He just put it all over you and it's baggy and leave. I went to a neighbor's house. They forgot it was Halloween and they gave me two sticks of gum. That's the worst. Because they didn't have candy. That's the worst. And they just gave you something when it comes to that. You guys, did you guys ever trade candy with your girls for kisses? Not everyone in my family is molested by me.

I'm saying I'm trying to help them I'm trying to help them go I'm saying if they're at home listening to this terrible podcast and they're not out having fun Like Cory. Hey, we should we should I'm not my own fun in my head. We should suggest some scary movies. Yeah, yeah Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'm just kidding. I like you all. Thank you Every bitch you're gonna kill you though Jeff. Let's start with you and go down to Cory. What's your favorite scary Halloween movie? I like I like alien for like a serious horror movie. Yeah, and for a silly horror movie I like this movie called basket case. Oh Basket case I like that movie It's kind of on and off Netflix at times, but it's basically a guy He has a what do you call that when you're born with like a touch like these twins? I mean, this is it. They don't like me. That's not the proper term. I joined. Yeah, so yeah This brain retakes like Newton brother was conjoined and they cut him off And he put him in a picnic basket and he's been living with his brother in this picnic basket and the guy goes around killing people So it's fucking ridiculous. Yeah, we should be a lot of fun with that I mean, you know, it's probably it's probably a popular choice, but the evil debt trilogy is a good. Yeah, that's always a good one Oh man army of darkness is yeah, you know people are divided on that, but I like that movie. Yeah, I must have been yeah Are you telling me like like the skeletons tied to like fucking like wheelchairs on fire rolling down? This is the problem. This is the problem people who liked the first movie It was kind of you be the first one or the second one which is the first one again That's the very I think the very first or the very first one was not aiming to be like outright comedy It was sort of no no and then yeah, can't be the second one was kind of like a little bit It was still kind of mostly hard But kind of silly and campy but then the third one was more trying to be a comedy Yeah, I think that's where turns people off, but I still think it worked. I like it. It's different It's the third movie is so different. It's fun. Yeah, like if you're it's also it's a sequel to a cabin of the woods movie Like what no, it's still makes so different. No, I like it although I kind of I like the I like the original ending There's a director's cut. Yeah That's a solid movie My favorite actual scary movies the thing thing. Oh, yeah, I can agree with that That might be one of my remake no no, oh wait The very original one is like the thing from outer space Yeah, grussell Love that Yeah, if you haven't seen the thing yet from the 80s with Fucking awesome I think it has the best scary atmosphere of any movie ever is as great like effects. Yeah practical effects Yeah, yeah, the atmosphere is perfect like they can get a lot across without doing too much The music is like it's all like 80 synth, but it's it's like the most suited soundtrack ever and it's it's so It's just the atmosphere is so perfect. I think if I recall correctly is it Wilbur Brunner? Yeah, he is He goes crazy. Oh, he's smashing the big edge Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's that's my favorite actual scary movie my favorite like I guess funny scary movies return of the living dead I do so I saw recently we just watched the yeah, it's really fun. It's a really fun Living there's also like fucking fantastically shot. Yeah, it's how they like get like I love that like dirt angles and shit where it shows like going into the I feel like people get turned off thinking it's like a spin-off like third one Also like some movies of the last like 20 years from 15 years have all been like a virus of just crazy people Yeah, I like the fact I kind of like the fact that it's just dead guys. It was fun They like the fact that zombies talk to you they say bright and so cheesy, but they do it well They can think in that movie. It's really funny. Yeah, they talk to the one. Yeah, you should watch it There's a really hot chicken to God. Yes. She's so hot to put a little piece of salad tape over a pussy They keep Zach your scary movies fear movie five that is terrifying Like my generic ass off of st. Donna dead 2005. I love that movie Yeah, the ball season four Lot of people hate on it, but it's alright. I really want to bring rames in it. It's a good movie But I don't know if it would scare me. I would go on. It's a horror. It's a scare. That's good point. I don't know No, I look at scared that often. I don't know. I can't always say we actually Not a fan movie cheap jump scares that movie was alright the country Yeah, I think it had two cool parts that had one part where they're playing When the game where they all hide and seek but the boat they knock and you have to follow that person They have one part at the beginning. I was that when they did that But it was like it was coming from inside the the clothes rack that was cool And they had a second part where one of the girls is like pointing behind the door to like the black spot It didn't show anything they just described it. Yeah, so it was interesting It was a cheap jump scare which they have but I thought they did some things well They did this stupid uh the reflection in the toy thing the jack-in-the-box. Yeah, that was it wasn't a jump scare That was the last movie. I saw the really scared I can't really think of a lot of movies though. I that's scaring me. I think the shine the original shining was pretty good Yeah, that was the legitimately Sound direction for that fucking movie. What about your comedy favorite comedy? I would say I'd just say every darkness because I can't think of a lot of Sean of the dead is good I'm trying to shut it that's good with you. Okay, but it did the other one. Well, it's hard like you think it'd be easier But it's weird like for example like just an aliens like the scariest movies I think wouldn't really necessarily be a throwable that's good good Halloween movies Yeah, we movies are pretty much always gonna be like party because you watch aliens any time of the year or the thing anytime of the year Same way, I can't really always watch the thing at Christmas actually snowy. That's yeah, even though they're terrible movies I think the hell raiser movies are always creep me in the fuck out the first one's good. Yeah I I see like I feel like a board just didn't throw our movies like like so it's the lambs is scarier It's more you know what I mean? So it's scary, but it's scary I'm not really gonna go for or because I can't really think because like again like it was I was scared when I was a kid so I guess hell raiser and Candy man and Freddy Cougar with the top three but for comedy I would have to say Brain dead. I really like brain dead. I don't know if anyone

I don't eat them because they suck. Okay. Well that, that and. What about candy corn? Do you have candy? Are your candy corn dying? I can eat a little candy corn, but it's like a, I feel like I'm eating candle wax. To be fair, candy corn's not bad. I like candy corn. But I wouldn't go out of my way again. I don't like normal candy corn. Because I can only eat like three or four of them and then I feel sick. But there's like these like exotic jelly bean candy ones or what the fuck candy corn? There's like these exotic jelly bean candy corn. It's like strawberry and like watermelon and that seems like a decent compared to the fucking disgusting dirt labor. I'm really walking himself. That's the one candy I have always hated. And even now I still hate his fucking jelly beans. I don't know why. Jelly beans. I agree. I don't know why. I don't even know why. I don't even know why. It's not even just the black ones. It's the, it's the, every color is this gritty. It's gritty, chewy, gross, gummy texture. Yeah. This aftertaste is fucking good. I don't mind jelly beans. They're so really good like fruity, like jelly beans that aren't like your generic cherry. Jelly, jelly beans are tolerable. But when you just get them in a bag. Oh yeah, jelly bellies. Just jelly beans, they're fucking horrible. But I still only eat jelly bellies because they're still like jelly beans suck dude. Fuck jelly beans. I would eat jelly bellies all day long. Fuck jelly. Uh, circus peanuts. I used to love circus peanuts when I was a little baby boy. Like they're a place to feed them to be left. You're stupid. Until the podcast, something they don't already know that you already haven't said, that you haven't said already. I like sour candies. What kind? I like sour patch kids. I like sour candy. I can't eat sour patch kids. Why not? Sour. It's too sugary. What about, you said that you were looking for warheads earlier. You were just talking about warheads. But it's not chewy. It's not chewy. The sour is being removed. That will blow your fucking head off, Corey. It's, it's sour, chewy shit. It's like sour skittles. I can't eat sour skittles. It's like chewy gummy shit. Yeah, at least we fucking bout to go. Sour heads is just like a containment of hard candy in this sour. When I think of sour skittles, like I almost puke because I ate too much when I was younger. It's, it's dude, sour skittles, sour patch kids, all, all difficult. I love sour shit. Do you, do you always know that kid in school, that cool kid that like put five warheads in his mouth and he's like, look what I can do. Yeah, it's like, yeah, I can eat like four like, four like, He's like, okay, I'm gonna eat like five. Which is the worst, which is the worst one again?

Yeah. I can eat six fucking black ones. Yeah. When you fit like six of them in your fucking mouth, the sour flavor just kind of like desensitize your mouth already. So you're just kind of like, well, something. I got this water really though because I was thinking about warheads. Warheads would kill me. My mouth is water because I'm thinking about penis. Pain. PENIS. Big penis. I like penis. I like penis. Zack, you said penis in a podcast once and it's so funny. I forget what it was, but you're like, pay-dance. What was this? I don't know. I don't know.

  Look for that in the audio waveforms. All right, um... Stamper, we were talking about how Jeff early just kissed his little girls with a mouth. You were talking about how you also met a black... With a juicy ass? Yeah, we were, don't steal our stampo. No! Yeah, I met a black girl once, the end. What'd you do then? What? What'd you do? Yeah, talk about it. I don't see what the fuck I'm talking about. Talk about our Airworn Black... We went to a fucking Mexican restaurant. I had the displeasure of listening to. We went to a Mexican restaurant and we were trying to figure out that biggie small song. And there was five white guys, and we said, what's that biggie small song? And you stopped the black girl, and you're like, what's that biggie small song? And she was like, juicy? And we're like, yeah! We're so fucking low. I have nothing to do with her being...

  There.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:00.465 --> 0:26:59.198]: 
  Yeah. Ooh, look at that. That's spectacular. This is pretty nice, actually. Ooh. It's a nice glow. It smells good. We have a whole box. You bring me one fucking candle. Oh. It's fun. All the things you want to look like. You can have a flask of candle. It's a fun one. You can have all your faces. But where were we? Well, we got two hours. We got two hours left. I think we should stop talking about it. Why do you think the power is going out? Anyways, it had nothing to do with her being black. It was fun fuck nowhere. It was because Wendy. It was. It's not Wendy though. I was putting in an outside opinion. That's all. This is Stanford. It was a funny situation. I feel like he fell back. It's not Wendy. What the fuck is this? The noise is on the window. It's the wind blowing. I don't know. All right. Why do we decide to set up a location so fucking far? Why? It's simple as that shit. Jesus, shut up. We did it to get away from you. And you tagged along. Seriously guys. All right. Let's just try to use the fucking best of what we have left and we'll be fine. As long as we do it fast. We have enough batteries. We're back to Willowry. What the fuck in the fuck? Willowry, sorry. We're talking about what would you rather be. We're talking about what you see black. Corey, what would you rather be out of every monster in fiction or real life? What would you be? What would you be monster? What would you want to be? What would you be, Corey? Would you be a ghoul of specter? The giant squid? Would you be a skeleton of ghouls? The mummy returns? I wouldn't like my own self if I was a giant squid. Me neither. Well, let's try a squid. It's not a ghoul. Let's break it down. It's fucking scary. Let's break it down. You're telling me. You're like 10 feet tall. Let's break it down. What? Frankenstein. What is Frankenstein? Some big, green-hoped, with giantism. Everyone's going to show me no matter where you go. That's not fun. I don't matter if you have polksay. I think it has one of the effects that he's fucking pieced together with dead guy parts, Corey. Not the fact that he's tall. They're just like, oh, he's a burn victim. Don't look at him. So what would you want to be? This isn't what wouldn't you want to be. What would you be? A werewolf. Why? He doesn't want to be a corny-ass werewolf. Why do you want to be a werewolf? I mean, a cool werewolf with shades. Corey is healthy. But anyways, I'm going to tell him. Oh, Cap, son. Jeff, look at spooky ghouls you want to be. I don't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:02.001 --> 0:25:02.457]: 
  That's good.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:17.543 --> 0:25:20.817]: 
  We got two hours, we got two hours left. We should stop talking about it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:23.247 --> 0:25:24.951]: 
  Anyways, I had nothing to do with her being so...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:27.989 --> 0:25:28.444]: 
  It's not-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:30.149 --> 0:25:30.992]: 
  This is Stanford.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:30.992 --> 0:25:33.844]: 
  There was a funny situation. I feel like he should back. Please, hold on, shut up!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:40.409 --> 0:25:41.303]: 
  Why do we need this?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:44.087 --> 0:25:48.306]: 
  It's fine, guys, it's just that shit! Jesus, shut up. We did it to get away from you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:49.184 --> 0:25:50.601]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:39.994 --> 0:26:41.462]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:47.335 --> 0:26:48.449]: 
  Why?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:49.394 --> 0:26:50.457]: 
  Why do you want to be a world?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:52.971 --> 0:26:55.452]: 
  And of course you go in there and a glass and Jr. you come out of the pool and you fly where you fly and I just like the being the real element of that look. The real element of what I would call you health anyway.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:54.945 --> 0:26:55.131]:

You were in a jersey, you kissed boys in the mouth. What is it with you and kissing kids? Yeah, stop it. What is it with kissing kids? Having your fucking relatives kick us you after doing something almost sexual or weird. Okay, Zach, what's the difference between a ghoul and like a... Just a fucking monster that you like. What's a ghoul? That's the best question. Oh, well think about it. If you're gonna be a mummy, you're gonna be a stinky old fucking stinky... Is it like a weirdo the mixture between a ghost and like a zombie? A ghoul? A ghoul, what the fuck's a ghoul? A feral ghoul is...

  팥!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:20.991 --> 0:28:49.628]: 
  I thought a ghoul was like an all-encompassing term for anything really. I don't know. It's a good insult. You're fucking ghoul. You look like a ghoul. It's a good insult, but it's more of a good adjective. Fucking sayghoul! I know! A scout is fucking worthless. You can just pull his bones apart and pull the ribbons. Yeah, but they don't get trained. They come in, they claw your eyeballs out. Just fucking hit it with their head where their bones break, dude. How about you take a bone? You know you can't live without all your bones. Well, like you pull out his feet and Bernie falls over. Yeah. You look like a ghoul.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:22.493 --> 0:28:22.746]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:25.632 --> 0:28:26.459]:

  Yeah, it's so funny. It's like a slightly stronger...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:51.990 --> 0:31:57.278]: 
  Chris. What are you? You started this tangent so you could tell us. You started this fucking... Fucking... Clearly you would have been some kind of monster you'd want to be. I actually don't know. How about a mothman? Mothman? Yeah. What, did he just fly right at you and play cars and stuff? What does he actually do? Yeah, but he had a movie made about him. You're actually attracted to fluorescent lights so you would die. I would fly towards the sun like a churristen fall. Fucking burn away the sun. No, you want that! You died in the car! Okay, I wouldn't want that. It was a joke. I would rather be... Chris is just like flapping around a bug zapper. Oh, then? You'd rather stick your feet in the sun. I would rather... I would probably want to be... Have you ever seen the movie Dog Soldiers? No. Dog Soldiers. You'd be like soldiers with dog... There's these really big cool werewolves in that movie. Did you ever watch Sesame Street? No. Did you... Oh, well do you remember when they had these adults with black dog heads over them and they would do stuff and drink tea and shit? No. And it would just be dog faces? No. All my Sesame Street memories went out with my childhood. Yeah, I don't remember. He says he's flushed out. He's still celebrating Halloween. I remember probably watching Sesame Street yesterday though, dude. It's fresh to my mind. It's a good show. It's a good show. Stamper, what kind of boss would you be? Okay, well hold on. To scare the boys and girls. Yeah, what would you be? I'd be a vampire and I bite their little fingers. You suck anyway, Stamper! You suck, Dicks. You suck the cuck out of a dick. Where's Jeff? I don't need to be a vampire to do that. Where's that to Jeff though? I think he... I think he would have said he gets CP at bars. What's your uh... What do you... Okay, what do you think are the lamest like Halloween characters? All of them, dude. They're all me. Oh, mummies. Yeah. Because they can bite you, can't they? What do they actually do to get you? Skeletons are lame. I'm not scared of a fucking skeleton. All the mummies, all the mummy costumes look like... Mummies don't really look like that ever. They never really have the bandages. They look nothing like that. They usually just look like little skinny jerky people. Yeah, they look like little beet jerky guys. You probably could eat them. What can they do to catch you then? What's the penalty for them? They would like grab on you and try but you can just push them away. Try to bite you. If the mummy actually tries to attack you, he's just gonna like fucking crumble and break them. You could snap them so easily. Yeah, they're like fucking like... They're not fucking dead, they've been dead for like five thousand years. They're bones are... They're all like kings so they're all pampered and weak and boring and they've never been in a fight in their lives. Yeah, so you know, they try to choke you and they just be really weak. I forget what movie it was. It had a really scary mummy in it when he came back and what he did when he chased after people. He did like mummification things on him so he put like a hook up their nose and like pulled their brains out and stuff so he did the same thing. That was kinda scary. That part in the first mummy movie where it shows the guy who had his eyes and tongue ripped out and gave me such bad nightmares. I love the first mummy, it's so good. You know what the scariest part in the first mummy was? The scarabs or the bugs. They're horrible. The first time he's like pulling it out and it crawls into his fucking arm. Yeah, it's gross. That shit, that fucking... The sea of them chasing them as they're trying to run out is a good one. It's a good movie. Mummies are corny, so are creatures from the Black Lagoon. Yeah, like... So are pussy sparkly vampires. The creature from the Black Lagoon with some like, I don't know, some evolved corona. That's what he fucking looks like with scales.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:55.484 --> 0:28:57.104]:

  They look nothing like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:39.569 --> 0:30:44.159]: 
  But we probably could eat them. What can they do to catch you then? And honestly, if the movie walks,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:52.444 --> 0:30:53.136]:

  MBC 뉴스 이준범입니다.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:59.202 --> 0:33:00.137]: 
  I told you it was a win, because it was picking up outside. No, actually, I think it's Jeff. The win doesn't knock. Why would Jeff waste his time? He doesn't have the energy to come up the windows and fucking knock him on. Cory, do you know what you really, do you stand for, do you guys really like really horrible, Chris, do you really like horrible, Halloween stories, do you like horrible Halloween experiences? Since you enjoy Halloween, and you're not like me, who's a Grinch. Actually, no, what's the worst part about Halloween? Steph, what do you fucking despise about Halloween? Yeah, what the fuck do you hate, because you can't like Halloween? It's only one day. Oh. No, seriously, you can't, that's a top-down. What the fuck is wrong? It's not, it's the city. I hate nothing about Halloween. Well, if a rotten pumpkin's outside your house, you have to throw away. Okay, picking up the cleaning, taking down the decoration. What about pranksters? That sucks, because it's labor. People who, you give them candy, they don't want it. I've never experienced a Halloween prankster. You don't watch too much TV. Yeah, that's pretty rare, but you don't get a lot of... Not where I live, dude. We had people coming and fucking like killing animals. You are from Missouri. Yeah, Missouri.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:25.594 --> 0:32:25.949]: 
  Yeah, we're

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:28.159 --> 0:32:28.463]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:32.445 --> 0:32:35.854]: 
  I hate nothing about how we...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:41.575 --> 0:32:45.119]: 
  taking down the decoration. What about pranksters? That sucks because it's labor.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:47.363 --> 0:32:47.954]: 
  alright!!!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:52.459 --> 0:32:53.404]: 
  Not where I live.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:55.750 --> 0:32:58.956]: 
  Killing animals. You are from Missouri. Yeah, I'm from Missouri.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:01.116 --> 0:33:51.083]: 
  Misery's a good movie to watch at Halloween. Oh yeah, well, he was writing a book or whatever. Yeah, that's a cool movie. So I guess the thing I hate most about Halloween would have to be, it's the fucking materialism, like how it's like you buy costumes for one day of the year, buy candy for one day of the year, it's pointless. You don't have to. I mean, you pretty much- You could walk around and look around the house. Like I said, if you have lights up in your house, you might get a trigger-trigger if you live in an environment where kids fucking come, you have to turn your lights off so kids don't come bother you all night. That's why old people are all so pissed off because they're fucking- They don't remember- I was 12 or 13, that was the last time I ever had a trick or two. I think I was 12, I was like from Jason. And we looked at this guy's door, and the fucking dude was like standing at the side of his door, and we were like, he was trying to avoid us. But he wasn't like out of center, so we'll see him. Jesus fucking Christ, dude. Is that Jeff?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:08.153 --> 0:33:09.959]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:52.112 --> 0:34:02.676]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:52.146 --> 0:33:53.007]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:52.214 --> 0:33:52.619]: 
  A note

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:53.007 --> 0:33:54.441]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:17.306 --> 0:34:52.507]: 
  Yeah, he's acting all mo- Fuck with me. I'm fucking with you! I was fucking with people. This is getting stupid. This is stupid. F you, Jeff. He knows we have like fucking two hours of battery left. You? He's just sabotaging it. We could probably use this to make it feel like funny. He's like the spook-a-boy. He would probably use this in the podcast. It all makes sense now. We could probably use all this in the podcast. Probably. Samford, it all makes sense. He eats. Just give it a one-soul run. He fucking eats Halloween. That's why he's sabotaging it. He's the creature so healthy. We talking about it! He said he liked it! Oh yeah, that's why he's going around smacking windows and fucking- Be the cool-o-eeve. Yeah. The cool-o-eeve.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:30.672 --> 0:34:32.494]: 
  We could probably use this to make it to like...

  Take it funny.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:34.992 --> 0:34:37.016]: 
  It all makes sense now.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:39.059 --> 0:34:42.197]: 
  Samford, all makes sense. Just give it a one-soul cut.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:44.728 --> 0:34:46.027]: 
  What are you talking about? He's sitting all the time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:45.335 --> 0:34:47.056]: 
  He said he liked it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:53.183 --> 0:35:10.935]: 
  This is weird, you don't spend fucking 40 minutes looking for bars. You think you'd come inside? I think you would, I think you would. I think you would back home. Actually, I don't care. He came with us, he couldn't have gone back home. I don't know, I don't see shit. I checked everywhere. We were just trying like, past the time until he gets back or... Look, look, look!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:06.430 --> 0:35:06.565]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:09.434 --> 0:35:12.994]: 
  This is the most fucking dysfunctional

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:12.994 --> 0:36:01.476]: 
  It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine. No, it's not dude, we have no power. I didn't, and fucking, it's two hours. Nobody fucking can see the power dude, it's, we're recording, it's fine. Yeah. As long as you cut the fucking stupid blip off noise, in a stupid fucking day, it's fine. We'll just, we'll try to cut Jeff out, just edit us and say he left. Yeah, okay. Marker, was that like the night time we fucking did that? I know it sucks, but look dude, just wait. Get back to the fucking, yeah, we need to hurry up dude, we got fucking, what did you dress up as? As a kid. Wait, we need to be more like, yeah. Okay, okay, okay, wait. We already did that, right? No, no, no, we didn't. All right, so, Stamper was a trainee, Zach was Moses. Corey, what did you dress up as as a kid when you were, I was a kid, it's a generic shit, like a vampire. Oh yeah, we did already talk about this. In the fucking, power rangers? Sorry.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:23.153 --> 0:35:25.161]: 
  Yeah. It's always been, it's always been You're the crew all year.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:36.737 --> 0:35:37.632]:

  Get back to the fuckers! Yeah, we need to hurry up!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:47.689 --> 0:35:49.275]: 
  We already did that, right? No, no, no, we didn't.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:02.134 --> 0:36:16.056]: 
  The next question has nothing to do with dressing up, just to make sure. We're gonna have to go for at least two more hours if we want to do this. I'm sticking to fucking topics, dude. Yeah. I mean, I appreciate them, but it kind of gets grating when you're like, you feel like it's the same regurgitated stuff.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:16.208 --> 0:36:16.680]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:16.917 --> 0:36:29.505]: 
  And it's fucking starting to get cold now that there's no goddamn power in here. Look, we'll uh... I need to get my coat, but it's right here. No, it's up here. Okay. Well, I don't know what we're gonna do.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:29.691 --> 0:36:32.594]: 
  Can you think of anything? What I mean? Halloween is like a one-shot.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:30.923 --> 0:38:33.435]: 
  I mean, Halloween is like a one trick pony. Yeah. What if we um... Yeah, wait, hold on. Um, I think we all got a little too grumpy there. Um, so let's... Well, it's hard fucking out here, dude. Yeah, let's spend a fucking disaster. Alright, let's inject some fun back into the podcast. Let's get preppy. The shaft doesn't get back in like five minutes. Probably go look for him too. But yeah, let's just... Yeah. What's up? Wanna tell ghost stories and have to like just candles and shit? It's gonna pass the time with ghost stories. Spooky scary stories? Spooky ghoulish stories? Let's tell spooky scary ghost stories. Yeah. Woohoo. Alright. Spooky stories. What kind of spooky stories? Like real life experiences? Like ghost stories. Do you have a... Here's a question. I'm legitimately curious. Has anyone ever had any ghost experiences? Cause I've... I do. I actually have a good one. You have a good one? I actually have a legitimately good one. Are you fucking serious? Ghost stories. Tell me. Okay, okay. So, I'm at this bar in downtown Philly. I think it was actually called Cori's. Cori's. Oh. So... It's this little piece of shit bar. It's got like four stools in it, right? Is it really? Yeah. Is it really called Cori's? It hasn't either. It's a C-O-R. Oh, yeah it is. Have you been there before? Cori's. A few times, yeah. Or something like that. Anyways, I'm the only dude in the bar, right? I get a beer and I'm sitting at the bar and I feel something tap my shoulder and I looked to my left because I thought it was somebody like pranking me like how do they tap your shoulder? Tap the wrong shoulder. And then I look back over and there's nobody there. So I turned all the way around and I was like that's fucking weird. So I turned back forward and I'm drinking my beer and I was like that was fucking strange because I'm the only guy in there and the bartender is at the other side reading a fucking newspaper song. So I thought maybe some plaster fell off the ceiling or something and tapped my shoulder like that. So I turned back around to look around the floor to see if something fell off the ceiling or whatever. And as I was turned around backwards I felt somebody grab my hand on the bar, the bar top and it went my head around and it was fucking Cori.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:42.330 --> 0:36:44.895]: 
  Yeah, this is better fucking than this. Alright!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:52.152 --> 0:36:52.185]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:52.185 --> 0:36:53.367]:

  Bye.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:14.950 --> 0:37:19.337]: 
  I actually have a legitimately good ghost story.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:57.914 --> 0:38:00.006]: 
  There's nobody there, so it turned all the way around, and I was like, that's...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:03.752 --> 0:38:07.650]: 
  and I'm drinking my beer and I was like that was fucking strange because I'm the only guy in there

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:09.574 --> 0:38:11.751]: 
  or the side of the side reading a fucking newspaper

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:12.882 --> 0:38:13.455]: 
  I thought it made some fun.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:16.645 --> 0:38:17.624]: 
  So I turn back around.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:22.467 --> 0:38:22.956]: 
  And as

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:34.634 --> 0:40:31.982]: 
  You. And your dad was fucking you. And moaning like a ghost. Really? Yeah, fucking you. Oh, oh, oh. How old was I? Woo! This was like last week. That's bullshit. I'm not allowed in bars anymore for some reason. But I don't recall that. It's good to have your bar get fucked by your dad loudly, Cory. You're a nuisance to Billy. I mean, I'm not allowed in bars anymore, but I don't really. Cory. I don't recall, actually. Cory. That's a true story. Cory, did you ever hear about a story about when I went to my grandparents' house and they were like, yo, it's a little bit hot there? Is this the genre that's just going to lead to me like fucking my dad or like me having a pussy? No, no, no. But the absurdity. I mean, it's both stories. I really did tell you that my grandparents' house was hot there. I talked about it. You talked about it before? Yeah, I talked about it before. Yeah, you talked about it briefly. I stayed there when I was 10. I stayed in the basement there. They have this basement there. It's a nice little basement, but they have these back glass windows that are on the ground floor. Because the back of the hill, they look like a hill. So the bottom part of the hill is where the windows come out. And so anyways, I think I was about 10. But 10 years old, I was with my cousin and one of their friends. And we were watching some kind of movie. And we heard fucking some kind of weird rumbling outside. We saw a dude standing outside of the fucking. This isn't like a ghost story, but we saw a dude standing outside of these huge fucking glass panels looking into us. We fucking shat our pants because I was 10. I thought you were like a monster, like a serial killer. We fucking closed the blinds, ran upstairs, like grandparents they. They called the cops. Apparently, the dude fucking broke out of some mental place and was watching us. You fucking serious? Yes. So apparently, they called him. The police came back, fucking grabbed his asshole, took him back to the asylum. And we went with him. We went like, because we had to identify him. You know those police things where they're like. You had to identify yourself. You know those police things where it's like, is this the guy? We went there. We saw the dude. We saw two guys. We saw you dead fucking in your violent glass.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:12.670 --> 0:39:13.007]: 
  � gods

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:13.007 --> 0:39:14.864]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:33.450 --> 0:41:37.491]: 
  Really? Really? Was I making fun of that story too? That's a strange story. I'll tell you, that is a strange story. I don't know how I can travel through time and meet all these people and somehow still have time to fuck my dad. I could be using my time travel powers for something useful. I just don't know how your dad's not associated yet. Probably because I allowed it. How do you fuck with your dad so much? I don't know. How about you enjoy the idea of me and my dad fucking behind a window? Let Chris tell a spooky scary story now. Really a good one. For real this time. I actually don't have a scary story, but I did memorize an entire piece by Edgar Allan Poe. Oh yeah, yeah. Well, you wanna go for it? Yeah, do this. Okay. Once upon a midnight dreary. Cory's dad fucked him in the ass.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:23.215 --> 0:41:24.345]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:23.485 --> 0:41:23.940]:

Yeah, he already can't see his wiener. I don't think we have a... I can't... I can't fucking see you jumping out there early. He's gonna scare the fuck out of Cory. Yeah, I can't see... He's running the phone. He's probably just gonna fuck Cory outside anyways. No, his dad's got dibs.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:58.990 --> 0:41:59.952]:

I'm not gonna go into that. Like a corkscrew pig tail, dragon tongue? Perfect Halloween story. This is gonna be a truly spectacular, Corian fucked my dad, I was gonna fuck my uncle... You know what we need to address? Now that it's Halloween, we should talk a little bit about pumpkins and pumpkin spice. Pumpkin spice, you're Christmasy little teenage girl, aren't you? Can't do America. Pumpkin spice is awesome, we talking about faggot. Stamper, I had pumpkin spice for the first time in my life this week. They got pumpkin cream cheese for your bagel at Wawa. They got pumpkin spice coffee, creamer, they got pumpkin donuts and Dunkin Donuts, and they're fucking on it. It's amazing! We don't have that, it's just you don't like fucking pumpkins. Pumpkin pie is good too. Now you're on the pumpkin side? I'm just saying, Christmas has been like his eyes have sparkled every day for pumpkin blade. I've never had it before, it's amazing. It's amazing when I find something that tastes good because my taste buds are shitty. How long does it take to piss? This is like fucking ridiculous. I was gonna go get them.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:43.641 --> 0:42:46.122]: 
  You know what we need to address? Now that it's Halloween, we should tell them.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:51.724 --> 0:42:53.226]:
