 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:38.312 --> 0:03:17.985]: 
  It's true. I had sleep paralysis. What did it? Explain your situation. I was in college and I was in a room with my roommate, Paul. And I was falling asleep, but I was lying on my back and you're not supposed to- Wait! What? Paul, hot. Did he have sexy lips? Sweet-fo- What if he's listening right now? He was definitely someone you would fuck. What was it? Did he like, grabbed you and made you fuck? Did he have a word for it? What was his positive qualities? He's really funny. Okay. And he's really beautiful. It's like a quality. What do you say? Anyways, listen. This is important. Wait, what kind of hot? Like- Did he kiss you on the cheek when you blush? What kind of hot? Like, like a hot stove? Yeah, a hot body. Hot girl. What?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:02:50.142 --> 0:02:50.699]: 
  Wait!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:50.496 --> 0:02:51.492]:

  What was his positive qualities?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:05.852 --> 0:03:07.455]: 
  We have to listen to that. Anyways.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:17.985 --> 0:03:21.090]: 
  Shut up, coin! Listen, long story short.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:19.521 --> 0:05:03.741]: 
  Listen, long story short, I was in college in a room with Paul. He was asleep next to me, and I was lying on your back, and you're not supposed to lie on your back, because that's what causes sleep paralysis. Because your mind goes into a state where it's like, oh, I'm falling asleep, except your body falls asleep, but your mind might stay awake, and that's what sleep paralysis is, because your brain's in your body, then, but you're still awake, but you can dream, and that's what also happens. So I was lying in bed, staring at the roof, and then the whole room turned into a fucking airplane, and I was on a cabin, and it was as real as can be. And then I looked at the window, we were flying into a mountain, right? I was like, this is not good. And then I woke up, and I was like, I couldn't move, and I was looking over at Paul, and I was just like, Paul, help me. And I couldn't move, and Paul was just like, yeah. And I was like, and then after like two minutes, it wears off, and you can sit up, and I was just like, Paul, and he was like, would. And I was like, I had sleep paralysis, and he was like, fuck off. And I went back to bed. I, hey, what's up, Tom? I have vividly experienced one here. I remember it. It was so fucking bizarre, because it was probably the first instance where I almost consciously know about it, because I didn't have it when I was a kid. And I was downstairs on the couch, and I was just cycling through shitty avatar things for your Xbox, just like stupid shit, like skateboards, and the fucking droning ass elevator music was playing, and I was just like, I was already tired as fuck, and it was so soothing. So I eventually fell asleep, and I woke up, and I couldn't fucking move after I woke up, and I'm like, I'm probably still asleep. And I closed my eyes, and I visualized myself getting up, like picking on the couch and lifting myself up, and when I opened my eyes up again, I was still asleep. So at that point, I was like losing my shit, because there was the most scary thing ever, and then it just fucking goes away, and you pop. It's really scary. I didn't have sleep.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:15.715 --> 0:04:16.154]: 
  I love you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:02.054 --> 0:05:06.930]: 
  That's really scary. I didn't have sleep paralysis. You were watching the Irate Gamer. Yeah, you caught it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:05.412 --> 0:05:21.949]: 
  Yeah, you're a gamer. Yeah, you're a cory. He came here to throw you a touch. No, I swear to God. I mean, the iReGamer has given me tons of different sleep paralysis things, but... What happens to these? His head full to run? Does he stand over you when his dick goes in? He usually runs into them. He falls over his hair. He's like, hey, cory, what's going on?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:05:15.570 --> 0:05:17.444]: 
  these? That was

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:17.444 --> 0:05:17.460]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:05:23.654 --> 0:05:34.943]: 
  The hell? I'm just gonna pay on you. I'll tell you what happened to me though. I had this weird thing where I don't know what it is. Maybe some of you doctors out there. Yeah, right. Some of you doctor listeners could diagnose this, but uh...

And one time, the worst thing that ever was, was I had a dream that I was like Bruce Willis and Dihon, I was trying to break out a window, and I just like grabbed someone to smash it with a few windows. You wish, man, you're going to die. I, yeah, and anyways, my dream is to smash this window, and I woke up, and I had a chair in my hand, the fucking window was cracked, I was like, well, I'm going to bed, I put the chair back down, I woke up. Oh, you really did it. And I woke up, and I was like, literally happened, I looked over there, there was fucking glass all over my floor. Oh, shit.

  Christmas.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:29:35.005 --> 0:29:36.945]: 
  What? Here's something to talk about.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:36.945 --> 0:29:38.937]: 
  It was an off-brand tuner, like it was...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:29:38.937 --> 0:30:01.229]: 
  Like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:46.649 --> 0:29:52.740]: 
  I did not shit on the couch. When I was a kid I did. It was my jeans.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:30:02.241 --> 0:30:21.462]: 
  I was like yeah, it'd be fine. I went back to the pit on that side too. I was like I put a fucking pillow over it. I was like yeah, it's fine. And then there's a huge dog whenever it's sniffed in. The dad was like, you pissed on my couch. I was like, no, the dog did it. And he was like, my dog did not piss on my couch. I was like yeah, I did it. And that was the whole thing that happened. You just immediately admitted it. I would have been like,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:19.724 --> 0:30:24.533]: 
  I would have stopped with the dog thing. That's genius.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:30:22.339 --> 0:30:27.942]: 
  dog thing that's genius would you say it's fucking dog you could lie you could have put a dog down for pissing out

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:26.001 --> 0:30:40.581]: 
  You're lying! You're gonna put a dog down for pissing on your couch! I have an idea. You should remind people, since they're all tuning out, why they liked us in the first place. Okay. I don't know if you, since we're all here, if you'd like to discuss animation briefly. Oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:27.942 --> 0:30:31.030]: 
  I'm not gonna count this shit. I have an idea. Oh.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:38.084 --> 0:30:42.944]: 
  So read topics? Oh yeah. Okay hold on hold on. Since everybody here is kind of...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:42.944 --> 0:30:47.837]: 
  I don't know if anybody listening realizes we all sort of got our start in art and animation. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:30:47.230 --> 0:30:49.508]: 
  Yeah, we still can't do it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:49.457 --> 0:31:17.369]: 
  I don't. And we got a lot of feedback from the general public as to what we should talk about aside from shit, feces, pro-lamps, pro-lamps. That's an important conversation. Tell me babies. There's many comments inquiring about animation. Baby pro-lamps. You know, for example, like all the ungrateful shits on YouTube that are always giving you guys a hard time about, why can't you just pump out like a five minute cartoon? I hate, they're not ungrateful shits. There are so worthless shits.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:54.402 --> 0:30:54.503]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:57.439 --> 0:31:01.320]: 
  That's an important conversation. Kill me, babies.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:04.982 --> 0:31:06.501]: 
  You know, for example, like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:09.707 --> 0:31:11.024]: 
  about

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:13.352 --> 0:31:42.479]: 
  Hey, they're not on grateful shirts. Shitheads. They're worthless shibbles. They're human beings with opinions and you have to look at it. I'll tell you what bothers me. They're ignorant. They're educated. They're uneducated opinions. They're ignorant. They're just ignorant. They're just ignorant and ignorant. And that's the thing. That's the thing when it comes to animation. For me, since I do frame by frame, I can't do tweens because I'm fucking awful at it, I have to draw each individual frame.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:31:20.052 --> 0:31:25.958]: 
  No, I'll tell you what bothers me.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:31:28.253 --> 0:31:30.767]: 
  They're horribly ignorant to it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:30.767 --> 0:31:32.556]: 
  And that's the thing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:41.804 --> 0:31:46.950]: 
  I like how your backwards like most people do twins because they're awful at real animations. I can! Hey yo!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:45.499 --> 0:31:52.283]: 
  I can't When I do just stab yourself

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:50.511 --> 0:31:56.350]: 
  Yeah, it's unintentional, but it still happens.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:54.797 --> 0:32:29.037]: 
  We go half. We go, like, so when you do a frame, sometimes a line work alone can literally take a whole day. It can take like six hours to just do like a single line. So you, and then there's sometimes where you animate something, you're just like, no, it's like shit. And so you fucking delete everything. That's six hours of work, you just delete it and you start over, or you'll be working and your flash crashes while it's saving. You're like, oh fuck. And then you realize you didn't save six hours ago, or it's corrupt. So you have to start all over. And this is, I'm, this is experience from doing the music video for Aaron.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:03.707 --> 0:32:04.585]: 
  We'll pray.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:03.775 --> 0:32:04.298]: 
  All right.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:04.298 --> 0:32:04.450]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:19.199 --> 0:32:19.958]: 
  You didn't save some money.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:28.632 --> 0:32:31.484]: 
  Would you like to elaborate on what that is that music video?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:31.635 --> 0:32:54.940]: 
  Oh the music video? At least link them to it, yeah. Yeah. Oh, let's see what it was. It is a Street Fighter music video that I did for Starbomb. For Aaron and Danny's like. Egoraptor. Yeah, I mean that's the thing. I'm on a straight name basis now. Yeah, you're too cool. I can't say Egoraptor, I can't hear Aaron. Because I don't really call him Egoraptor. Tom, hey. I had breakfast with us this morning. Tom, Tom.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:32:46.688 --> 0:32:47.937]: 
  I can't believe it's too cool.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:47.937 --> 0:32:48.679]: 
  I can't say.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:53.438 --> 0:32:53.505]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:32:54.383 --> 0:32:57.707]: 
  I call him Tub, door is open. Yeah Tommy, if you're a Tub boy...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:54.940 --> 0:32:58.821]: 
  Yeah Tommy, if you're a thug boy, Tommy Hanks.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:58.821 --> 0:33:17.586]: 
  Yeah, but nobody's gonna know people are gonna people are gonna associate us with Aaron because a lot of people know that we know Sure, yeah, but some people don't maybe some people okay. Well cause I'm sorry. Well, I start now go forgive me How how long I'm using video take you Corey. Oh that took six months of constant work. No

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:04.525 --> 0:33:05.217]: 
  After humans become coat hunters, people can't really get over what they've seen. Not much get over what they've known they feel in their own benefit, they feel that they can be a part of their lives here, that someone needs and is the only one that they can provide. Since nobody really knows what their plan is, which is the care delivery is, where anybody can contact their neighbor, and just show them how they feel, or some people just can't get back at all. So for you, can you call aерospa, a C rival for any from Yimbira, can you call joining? Just call now and it would make you a fan, you can call Yimbira Od單� pork吃班,

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:06.854 --> 0:33:08.085]: 
  Okay well...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:08.862 --> 0:33:09.739]: 
  Where we start now, go.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:08.997 --> 0:33:09.317]: 
  Wait, stop.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:12.996 --> 0:33:13.874]: 
  Thank you, Cory.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:17.097 --> 0:33:18.615]: 
 是、「那是他

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:18.615 --> 0:33:27.441]: 
  Everything you're trying to say I'll sum it up with one point when you go and you release something finally after like two months And people assume that it's all you've been working on for two months

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:27.306 --> 0:33:34.799]: 
  That one, the fact that maybe your father died or you have other obligations or you have a fall back job. This is what drives me, that's why I'm asking you, if you take a year...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:32.183 --> 0:33]: 
  This is what drives me, that's right. If you take a year between the cartoons, then maybe the cartoons take a month or two months.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:38.663 --> 0:34:03.773]: 
  I've been waiting for this! You took a whole year? That's another thing too. We talked about this. We talked about the attention spans of people on the internet now. And it's like, if you don't get a fucking cartoon out in three months tops, people are going to be like, wait, you animate? Because it's like you have to constantly make stuff. Unfortunately, when it comes to frame by frame animation, it takes me like eight months and then I have to worry about paying rent and I have to worry about it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:38.730 --> 0:33:41.768]: 
  I've been waiting for this.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:52.382 --> 0:33:52.956]: 
  Wait, yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:02.693 --> 0:34:23.280]: 
  I wouldn't mind if they were if they were bored that just didn't like us it was like oh I know how long it takes but fuck you whatever cool I respect that's fine But people who like family got gets the episode every week and say are you kidding me dude? That's stupid million dollars Yeah, let's let's go over budgets of cartoons series a family guy the Simpsons of million dollars per 22 million

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:06.996 --> 0:34:08.581]: 
  I guess it was like, oh, I know, I know.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:16.362 --> 0:34:18.572]: 
  A million dollars you anniversary! Let me just give this a fucking say!!!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:23.280 --> 0:34:25.862]: 
  And that's a studio.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:23.989 --> 0:34:28.949]: 
  That's a studio. That's a studio of people. A whole studio. Yeah, like six or seven people.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:27.550 --> 0:34:33.911]: 
  Yeah, that's like six or seven people. Like another... Sorry, go on. Six or seven people. Like hundreds of people. Anabedics, but millions.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:29.609 --> 0:34:31.650]: 
  for precise

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:29.946 --> 0:34:30.992]: 
  Sorry, go on.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:32.275 --> 0:34:32.292]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:32.292 --> 0:34:42.467]: 
  AnimatedX budget millions! $750,000 per episode working up like small budgets were one guys Sometimes we'll have a couple people help out like Yada or just a friend or somebody else

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:42.382 --> 0:34:47.952]: 
  Yeah. Yeah, people think I'm killing it in YouTube. I make $200 a month on a good month. Oh, I make $90 a month.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:47.952 --> 0:34:53.520]: 
  nothing. Again, I make $200 on my YouTube. You're a rich idiot. You're the richest. You're the best.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:50.888 --> 0:35:02.498]: 
  You're much better than you are. But here's the thing, here's the thing. Like my partners for YouTube, they're fine. They pay me what I earn. Unfortunately, I haven't made any content, so I haven't earned it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:59.207 --> 0:34:59.899]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:01.418 --> 0:35:14.496]: 
  Well, no, that's it. See, that's it. It's easy to kind of misconstrue that. Like, they're not paying me shit, but they're paying me what I'm worth. And you can't put... You can't... It's like a thing where you have to produce to make money, but you don't have time to produce because you're doing another thing.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:13.619 --> 0:35:51.149]: 
  There's another thing there too, it's like if you produce or if you make something You take like a few months to make it right and then you've uploaded and then you wait another month for the money to Gradually Yeah, also then you have to wait another month to get paid because they don't pay you straight away Yeah, you have to wait and if you want to make a cartoon it'll take like five months to get paid literally and another thing is it's like all of us Do everything so it's like sound effects mixing music voices Backgrounds after effects Somebody can step in and actually do something. It's like the best thing ever like when someone

 SPEAKER_04 [0:35:14.496 --> 0:35:15.745]: 
  That does it, does it catch on?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:24.621 --> 0:35:27.625]: 
  And it's like only a few thousand dollars.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:35:27.625 --> 0:35:30.004]: 
  then you have to wait another month to get paid because I don't

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:30.004 --> 0:35:30.949]: 
  I'll pay you straight away.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:35:30.949 --> 0:35:32.940]: 
  Yeah, you have to wait and it has to build up.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:32.502 --> 0:35:32.907]: 
  It's like a

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:43.656 --> 0:35:44.213]: 
  Sexy back.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:45.833 --> 0:35:47.824]: 
  We're the holes where the ones nobody can step on.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:50.997 --> 0:35:59.940]: 
  someone's like yeah I have time to do background check oh fuck thank you Jesus are you fucking right now and you start crying just one fucking background

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:53.460 --> 0:35:53.950]: 
  네

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:53.950 --> 0:35:56.498]: 
  Thank you Jesus. Are you fucking kidding me?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:55.502 --> 0:36:12.462]: 
  Are you fucking right now and you start crying? Just a little bit. One fucking background can take like three or four hours. No, that's true. A fucking background for me can take like a whole goddamn day. Three or four hours doesn't sound like a whole lot, but for three or four hours of work for literally like two seconds in the cartoon.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:59.451 --> 0:36:01.088]: 
  back and take like three four

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:00.531 --> 0:36:00.565]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:04.210 --> 0:36:07.197]: 
  For more hours, it would sound like a whole lot before three.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:11.432 --> 0:36:23.447]: 
  I think it should be noted, two of the hours we put in, I mean a lot of people say, well you guys are just big YouTubers who make too much and you don't get it. A lot of people, let's say the average person works 40 hours a week and gets paid 40,000... That's what I was talking about, no, no.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:21.760 --> 0:36:27.160]: 
  That's what I was taught. No, not to interrupt you, but this one I was talking about that Twitter poster made that a cut a lot of

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:23.447 --> 0:36:32.526]: 
  I got to interrupt you, but this one I was talking about, that Twitter post I made that it cut a lot of flag for it, when I was like every construction worker that's talking about real work and shit like that. Yes, I did the research by the way.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:30.130 --> 0:36:45.216]: 
  real work and shit like that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:40.305 --> 0:36:40.643]: 
  There's been

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:45.216 --> 0:36:54.936]: 
  hours a week, 50 hours a week.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:51.578 --> 0:36]: 
  real

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36 --> 0:36:52.945]: 
  비apon

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:52.945 --> 0:36:52.962]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:54.936 --> 0:37:03.087]: 
  I'm like to everybody in this room right now hasn't talked about a vacation everybody in this room I'm sitting with four other people

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:58.497 --> 0:37:00.994]: 
  everybody in this room, I'm sitting with four other people.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:37:00.640 --> 0:37:04.605]: 
  or other people.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:03.998 --> 0:37:07.002]: 
  what! that a minute worth its 2 14 hours date

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:07.002 --> 0:37:18.494]: 
  every day, no days off, for as long as I've known you guys for almost a decade now. You've never taken it, I think Jeff left because somebody died.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:08.234 --> 0:37:10.444]: 
  No days off for as long as I've known you guys.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:10.444 --> 0:37:12.689]: 
  guys for almost a decade now.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:18.004 --> 0:37:21.447]: 
  And because he had to go and he didn't want to.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:37:21.447 --> 0:37:33.057]: 
  I'll be courteous for you, you work what? Honestly, how many hours per day? 14? 14, 15. You wake up, you go to the docket, do what it's, wipe your ass with a napkin, and then you work for 15 hours for a bed!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:27.741 --> 0:37:28.112]: 
  You wake up.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:31.605 --> 0:38:17.573]: 
  to hell with your bed. It's shocking how much. You go back to your desk with your shitty ass. No, God, I don't want to see this again, though. Realistically, though, I actually am a workaholic. I do enjoy working, and I do enjoy what I do. I love to draw, I love to animate, and I'm very fortunate to be in the position I am, and that's a thing. A lot of people, that's another problem people have talked about, is talking about how you got to where you are. A lot of people think you can just handouts, and it's like if you don't help someone out, you're an asshole, but realistically, what it comes down to is I worked my fucking ass off for seven or eight years and got to where I am. I met all these guys from putting my shit out and trying. This is a pretty common email that we get, like how do we get our foot in the door, and it's like not one of us has an easy answer. You just look at it, and you just do stuff that you do it constantly.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:34.170 --> 0:37:37.647]: 
  Now, would you go back to your desk with your shitty ass?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:08.967 --> 0:38:14.940]: 
  This is a pretty common email that we get like how we get our foot in the door and it's like not one of us has an easy

 SPEAKER_04 [0:38:14.940 --> 0:38:24.441]: 
  Just do stuff that you're going to constantly... There's no easy answer. Practice fucking practice, if it just suck it, get better, get better. And you make serious......life choices....life choices. Exactly!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:21.488 --> 0:38:30.415]: 
  series Exactly just ridden not to throw you one of the bus or anything, but you went without eating for like four days Oh, man, I could talk to you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:23.445 --> 0:38:24.745]: 
  and like Zach just really...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:27.833 --> 0:38:28.947]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:38:28.002 --> 0:38:40.439]: 
  Oh man, I can talk to you. Boy and I are dead fucking broken. This is a pity thing. It's just like to put perspective. A lot of people really think we make like a million dollars per year with these big YouTube guys who work two hours a day for spoiled assholes.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:29.436 --> 0:38:29.504]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:31.275 --> 0:38:32.136]: 
  Okay, let's visit the...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:40.439 --> 0:38:42.447]: 
  ticket answered to any of it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:38:41.502 --> 0:38:52.099]: 
  Like what you said, we're super, super fortunate to have the jobs we have. It's also like, you need to understand the perspective of what we do and what goes behind it. Or else, you know, you know, a way to get a job.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:45.940 --> 0:38:47.020]: 
  So you need to understand the process.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:52.099 --> 0:39:00.250]: 
  Weird view. So what I ate yesterday? Yeah. I drank eight beers and I had two bowls of kicks.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:38:55.795 --> 0:38:56.369]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:00.250 --> 0:39:13.446]: 
  That's all I ask. Not fast, but more than most people get spoiled. Sits white males. Whatever. Not fairness, you guys could be a two-marker by vegetables, but... And it's like $60. You're eating kicks. Yeah, cereal, I really like that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:01.988 --> 0:39:02.933]: 
  There it is.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:10.645 --> 0:39:26.102]: 
  It's like $60. You're eating cakes, cereal, everything. I mean, they're a damn corn. No, realistically, like right now, the amount of... Hold on. Calde corn, Calde... Calde. This is all corn has to use though. That's all I have to my name right now. Let's see.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:13.446 --> 0:39:14.442]: 
  Actually, no.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:39:14.442 --> 0:39:14.492]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:14.492 --> 0:39:14.880]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:16.720 --> 0:39:19.437]: 
  I'm out of, hold on. Caledit coin, Caledit.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:39:18.154 --> 0:39:19.960]: 
  Caledit coin, Caledit!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:20.500 --> 0:39:23.082]: 
  mmm.... this is all great at Jia's Cats

 SPEAKER_04 [0:39:24.449 --> 0:39:30.945]: 
  My name right now let's see 2550

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:28.094 --> 0:39:30.827]: 
  Shit, maybe you got caught us!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:30.945 --> 0:39:35.130]: 
  So yeah, I got like a dollar fifteen. I think we're going to the market.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:39:34.827 --> 0:39:47.061]: 
  Cory's been there with me all day, we're a night of us had money and one of us gets like 10 bucks, he's like, what a good McDonald's and we get a fucking $1 hamburger it's scarred me down like fucking homeless guys we're like, oh, truly fucking big ass

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:44.361 --> 0:40:17.942]: 
  That's a thing, that's a thing. And that's exactly, I wouldn't trade that situation for the world. Because A, here's something that I've realized after being in that sort of situation. I've realized you appreciate the little things when you finally get it. If you haven't eaten for four days and you eat a fucking McDonald's cheeseburger, it tastes like a steak meal from fucking Outback. It's amazing. And then when you drink beer to compensate for food, and then you eat something, it tastes even fucking better. When I got back to America this time, I was like Zach Laws played, and I was like, damn, and I was like, yeah, it's because he's in the... It's not because I'm not eating!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:11.564 --> 0:40:12.441]: 
 トゥタ いやお腹

 SPEAKER_04 [0:40:12.441 --> 0:40:12.694]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:40:16.778 --> 0:40:20.997]: 
  It's not 80, it's not 100. What you should do? I have no fucking money.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:20.997 --> 0:40:27.949]: 
  That's what I'm losing my mind. Chris, all you gotta do is not burn all your money. Okay, finally, an easy solution.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:26.363 --> 0:40:34.244]: 
  Finally, an easy solution. I don't know, it's like why, I don't know why artists are such terrible like business people too. No, oh yes, yes. That's a thing, absolutely.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:31.392 --> 0:40:54.578]: 
  No, no, no, yes, absolutely. That's the thing too also, like I don't mean to like, I'm sorry. I had it, I had it. Cause like we all earn our earnings. Chris earns his earnings, he does let's plays and stuff. That's how he gets extra money. Zach does work, all of us do work, like we all have a certain thing and we all have something as we're just every month, for me at least, it's just I gotta make rent this month, so I gotta make enough. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:54.578 --> 0:40:56.991]: 
  So the bottom line is really

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:56.991 --> 0:41:11.132]: 
  that we do it because we want to do it and any success or financial gain is a natural byproduct of doing something that we would want to do anyways is not exactly feel that you jump into low because you think it's gonna be financially stable or

 SPEAKER_04 [0:41:11.132 --> 0:41:16.127]: 
  This thing is the most, this job is literally probably one of the most financially

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:16.094 --> 0:41:19.772]: 
  unstable unstable you're welcome on the razor's edge it's like dude what

 SPEAKER_04 [0:41:17.309 --> 0:41:25.004]: 
  You're welcome on Razer's Edge. Dude, you could make $40,000 to the next year. You could make $100,000 next year. You could make $10,000.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:24.143 --> 0:41:24.177]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:24.177 --> 0:41:26.961]: 
  It's not stable.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:25.004 --> 0:41:32.159]: 
  It's not stable. On YouTube, the first year I joined YouTube, I think I made about $1,200.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:32.159 --> 0:41:33.694]: 
  in a year.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:33.694 --> 0:41:39.449]: 
  year and people are like how do I do this and it's like dude I was just doing it I wasn't even expecting it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:41:39.314 --> 0:41:48.443]: 
  I always say this, if you're getting a derivation for the body, don't be a fucking doctor, you're not getting derivation for the body. I'll tell you one thing, nobody I know got a derivation for the body.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:46.772 --> 0:41:47.346]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:48.443 --> 0:42:01.555]: 
  animation for the money, that's an action, that's an action. Or the fake money. Any time you see people do that, it's like, it doesn't work. It's also like to their head, like they're very diluted. It's like, oh, it's like themselves up. If they get lucky, that's it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:41:49.725 --> 0:41:49.945]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:41:52.442 --> 0:41:52.459]:

Here's the thing, two things. One, if the biggest mouth always wins, you can

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:00.734 --> 0:45:06.893]: 
  He's like trying to act like he's a 20-year-old. No, here's what he's like a snake. Here's the thing, two things.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:58.259 --> 0:47:59.693]: 
  of Hollywood like this.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:59.220 --> 0:47:59.744]: 
  like this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:13.092 --> 0:48:14.577]: 
  Okay, so literally...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:48:23.942 --> 0:48:41.003]: 
  My first experience with Hollywood in New York is completely different. Yes. You know, when Chris and I first went to Hollywood, we were like, we were super stoked. You know, the stuff you see, the candy you grow up with it. And we went there and the guy, the driver, was like, you guys want to see the Hollywood side? I was like, yeah dude, sweet. And he pulled around and he was like, you know,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:40.902 --> 0:48:43.534]: 
  Oh, you mean that thing up on the hill? Yeah, the Hollywood side. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:48:41.847 --> 0:48:49.491]: 
  on the hill. Yeah, the Hollywood side. Yeah, and he pulled her out and it was like the most underwhelming thing I've ever experienced in my life. Because it's really small. There's some gay dude with AIDS over here.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:47.044 --> 0:48:48.074]: 
  Because it's really small.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:49.491 --> 0:48:54.891]: 
  side of the road and there was like there was like small everywhere and there was like there was a whole bus stop. It was dirty, it was trashy. And it was like.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:48:52.444 --> 0:49:00.814]: 
  There was a whole bunch of dirty, trashy... And he was like, look, it was like behind Svallko, and I was like, oh my god. What do you want with the exact opposite?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:57.996 --> 0:49:02.957]: 
  Yeah When do you want? Was he exact that? I was like How do you know he was a gay guy with AIDS? Oh, cause he said hi there!

 SPEAKER_04 [0:49:02.029 --> 0:49:09.927]: 
  Oh, because he said, I have AIDS! I said, get out of here! Get out of here! I'm gay! I'm gay! I have AIDS! Let me tell you something. When we... What do we know?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:06.754 --> 0:49:13.960]: 
  Let me tell you something When we New York is fucking pristine I know dude But the thing is everyone's like Oh dude

 SPEAKER_04 [0:49:11.850 --> 0:49:20.440]: 
  I know, but the thing is everyone's like, oh, do you want to try guys at Pigeons and Pizza? You go there and it's like, oh my god. That's funny. Okay, that's the thing.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:16.626 --> 0:50:09.327]: 
  Oh my god. That's funny. That's funny. Okay, that's the thing. It's spray paint everywhere. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. It is hilarious. The amount of difference people think. When people think of New York, they think this like shitty rank fucking rats running around, people getting bit, turning into mutants. How does they fucking think New York is? How does you think New York is? Why do you have? When you go to California, everyone's like, oh, it's like Beverly Hills, everyone's rich. Guess what? 90% of the people are homeless and crazy and trying to kill you. When we were going to meetings in Hollywood, we went, we were gonna drop off in a taxi and the taxi guy was like, you'll be careful on the street. And this was like the street that a big studio was on. Yeah. People have been stabbed here. And it's Seth Green. Oh, is it Seth? Yeah. When he was going to shout out on the street, someone like smacked him and took his camera and there's a video on YouTube of him screaming about it. It's funny. When we went to the studio, when we went to the studio.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:20.440 --> 0:49:24.591]: 
  spray paint everywhere. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. It is hilarious.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:31.577 --> 0:49:32.505]: 
  How's they fucking...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:32.505 --> 0:49:36.117]: 
  I'm juicing! What do you have?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:36.117 --> 0:49:36.859]: 
  California

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:54.055 --> 0:49:54.105]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:49:54.105 --> 0:49:54.291]: 
  See ya!

 SPEAKER_04 [0:49:58.240 --> 0:49:59.455]: 
  Yeah, but when he was gonna...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:02.340 --> 0:50:02.661]: 
  There's a big...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:03.792 --> 0:50:06.002]: 
  It's great. When we went to the

 SPEAKER_04 [0:50:06.002 --> 0:50:15.267]: 
  studio. When we went to the studio, he's like, let's stop my fucking camera! He puts like a food table in the store.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:11.301 --> 0:50:52.949]: 
  He puts it like a food table in the store. So me and Stemper, when we started the show Table Flip, it was like in a rented studio, the place was. And basically what ended up happening was we went there and it's fucking hilarious because outside it looks like this horrible back alley place where you get gunshots and then you walk inside though and it's this prestige like green screen place and these fucking places, this like shitty rank horrible place cost thousands and thousands of dollars. You know where like the green screen, all these special effects to like rent out a studio is so much fucking money. I mean obviously there's good places in California but Hollywood is not a good place.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:48.629 --> 0:50]: 
  California.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:50 --> 0:50:49.152]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:50:49.995 --> 0:51:01.504]: 
  But nobody is not a good place to live. There's no way we're gonna live there in these places. When Chris and I went to our studio, we had to walk past the fucking homeless lady, like talking to rocks and shit. I remember.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:55.109 --> 0:50:56.205]: 
  to your studio.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:00.981 --> 0:51:01.875]: 
  I remember

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:00.998 --> 0:51:02.500]: 
  She was nice though

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:02.534 --> 0:51:04.491]: 
  If you're, if I had a dollar for you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:04.491 --> 0:51:08.946]: 
  every time that I had to tell an online animator to say, don't move

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:08.946 --> 0:51:13.452]: 
  to Los Angeles and you could do your job from anywhere in the world. You could be sent.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:11.444 --> 0:51:14.684]: 
  anywhere in the world.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:51:13.452 --> 0:51:25.939]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:25.939 --> 0:51:39.709]: 
  Go anywhere, go anywhere, stay where you are! If you're paying a reasonable amount for rent, why fucking go to Las Vegas and live in a ditch and pay $40 million? You're not going to Los Angeles, California, Hollywood!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:27.441 --> 0:51:28.673]: 
  Stay where you are!

 SPEAKER_04 [0:51:37.988 --> 0:51:54.458]: 
  You're not gonna move to LA and become friends with Keanu Reeves and fuck you. You're gonna move there and die immediately. You're gonna move there and you're gonna be the exact same level of talent that you're just gonna be payboard. All it's gonna do is fuck you. You're gonna move there and pay two grand for a studio or a studio.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:42.308 --> 0:51:45.464]: 
  You're gonna move me out of the fucking house! You're gonna get shot and die!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:51.775 --> 0:51:57.630]: 
  You're gonna move there and pay two grand for a studio or a apartment to live on clothes. Stay where you are!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:56.989 --> 0:52:02.642]: 
  that you're working at Starbucks part time at Meet Bruce Willis. You're gonna be... Passing your script. You're gonna be...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:58.660 --> 0:51:58.997]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:11.535 --> 0:52:18.690]: 
  If you have a laptop and a wireless connection, you could make cartoons on our bridge in fucking Kansas. If you don't have a laptop and a friend...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:12.497 --> 0:52:13.037]: 
  BYE

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:16.598 --> 0:52:28.495]: 
  You know what, he doesn't matter what you're trying to do with your laptop trackpad. Yeah. Fuck in. Yeah, you should move somewhere that you don't pay tax. The other thing too is, speaking like...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:52:27.044 --> 0:52:27.887]: 
  The only other thing too is...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:52:28.495 --> 0:52:36.207]: 
  You don't need a people so what do I need to animate you don't need all this shit Don't get all this equipment you can if you're fucking rich, but yeah, that's what you need you need to be motivated

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:29.170 --> 0:52:31.094]: 
  People say, what do I need to animate?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:34.536 --> 0:53:04.202]: 
  Yeah, that's what you need. You need to be motivated and you need to be willing to create stuff and get no reward in a few years. That's another thing. That's something people probably talked about is like the process. Like when people think like, oh, I gotta get the best stuff to be a good artist. I gotta get a Cinti 24 HD and it's like let me fucking tell you something. I've been using, I used the bamboo fun. I eventually use the Cinti because it does speed up your work process and make animating a lot easier when you draw on a screen. However, I was using a bamboo fun. And a mouse too. Yeah, and a mouse. I was like, we were animating a mouse.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:01.080 --> 0:53:07.189]: 
  I'm out of fucking, yeah, I'm out of fucking TV show on bamboo fun. Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:05.789 --> 0:53:23.440]: 
  Yeah, and it's like, Stanford still uses it fucking into us. Yeah, even if it's about a street still. I've seen people using things done with it before. Yeah, and I know amazing artists, like, literally, people who can fucking paint them on a Lisa on Psy, and they literally use fucking bamboo funds, and it's like... If you're bystanders, I can't...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:09.231 --> 0:53:12.572]: 
  Yeah, even in a two or three story. I've seen so many things done with a book.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:53:23.440 --> 0:53:28.941]: 
  I need to go, I need to move to this place and you can dissuade me, don't be better. No. No. Be better one.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:53:29.937 --> 0:53:43.319]: 
  So if you really want to do all the animation then you want to do all the animation If you're in it for like the favorite success you're gonna fail period You know technology doesn't reflect you You're not good. It's not gonna. Yeah, you can shoot

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:38.374 --> 0:53:52.499]: 
  You know technology doesn't reflect you. You're not good at talking at young. You can shoot an amazing movie on a $500 camera versus a $5,000 camera. You know what you're doing and you know you're lighting and you really want to get the job done.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:39.994 --> 0:53:40.534]: 
  to you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:43.319 --> 0:53:43.335]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:44.702 --> 0:53:45.006]: 
  500

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:45.630 --> 0:53:48.938]: 
  versus a $5,000 camera. You know what you're doing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:48.938 --> 0:53:48.989]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:52.499 --> 0:53:56.245]: 
  You can get it done. Study it. It's not easy, but you can get it done.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:53.157 --> 0:53:53.258]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [0:53:53.258 --> 0:53:56.717]: 
  It's not easy, but you can get fun.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:56.245 --> 0:54:01.257]: 
  You gotta fucking practice with Lewis and keep losing keep losing also another thing again

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:00.379 --> 0:54:02.792]: 
  Again, there's no magic answer for any of you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:54:02.792 --> 0:54:12.445]: 
  If you want to do it, just do it. One big thing is if you ask for critique, don't shoot somebody's critique. So if you say I would critique it, people give you critique. That's a whole other subject. Hey, hey, can you end the video?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:09.880 --> 0:54:14.554]: 
  That's a whole other subject. We're not even gonna get it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:12.445 --> 0:54:20.444]: 
  I don't wanna get into that. Critique is a slipper or slope. Let's talk about it. Critique is 90% of the time. Critique is tell me how good I am. Tell me how good I am. I don't wanna hear.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:18.840 --> 0:54:19.414]: 
  To be...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:20.444 --> 0:54:22.604]: 
  anything bad. But also...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:21.507 --> 0:54:26.434]: 
  But also, Chrétin can also be like, you should do it this way and the person doesn't know what they're talking about.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:54:25.995 --> 0:54:31.446]: 
  Protein well, that's the critique that that's just big bossy if people if people come

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:29.910 --> 0:54:34.568]: 
  Yeah, but when you talk about gratees, you're getting into gray areas. Yeah, but it is gray, but it's also gray.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:54:32.847 --> 0:55:01.450]: 
  But it is great, but it's also not very great. Just do what you like. The end. Yes, but also if somebody says something about your work that can be confirmed by other people, like if somebody says your anatomy is bad, that's provable. But if somebody like- But I know it's horrible. But when it comes to like comedy and stuff, I kind of let that slide because I'm going to make myself laugh. If somebody else didn't laugh at my stuff, then sorry. But for stuff like art and shots and angles and sounds, I'm going to listen because that is objectively like provably improvable.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:35.344 --> 0:54:37.217]: 
  If you just do what you like, the end.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:01.450 --> 0:55:09.297]: 
  You should listen to people you respect. That too! Exactly. One last thing I want to talk about. And this is important. And this is what I've realized.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:55:02.985 --> 0:55:04.335]: 
  That too, exactly.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:05.567 --> 0:55:06.259]: 
 OK

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:13.448 --> 0:55:52.952]: 
  No, the last thing about the topic about animation is you should do stuff that you want to do. I know we talked about it briefly, but if the new cool thing is some fucking trend and everyone's doing it, you should consider how fucking viral that will be because I know like... And not do it. Yeah, and not do it because you should do things that you want to do unless you have an idea where you're like, you know what, it'd be funny, I think it's funny. And then you do that. If you're doing it with specific motives to reach whatever requirement is popular for that day, then you're just fucking falling in line with everyone else. Well, the people who did Harlem Shake parties, I bet they feel really good about this. Oh, god. Well, this isn't like Shoot.Paris either.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:16.874 --> 0:55:17.498]: 
  about animation.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:30.492 --> 0:55:32.669]: 
  and not do it. Yeah, and not do it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:37.799 --> 0:55:39.182]: 
  And then you do that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:46.810 --> 0:55:47.907]: 
  someone else.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:55:50.269 --> 0:55:59.483]: 
  This isn't like Shoot.Pairty's either. If you have a good idea for a pair you like, and you want to do it, just to cash in, then do it. It's your...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:53.644 --> 0:56:02.234]: 
  If you have a good idea for a pair that you like and you want to do it, then do it. If you're doing it because, hey, that's a reference.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:02.234 --> 0:56:12.848]: 
  How tempting is that when you see like a kid animate like something not that funny with like Mario and Look everybody, every kid did that. Everybody does that. It's definitely one of those things where you just think like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:07.617 --> 0:56:18.349]: 
  Look, everybody, every kid did that. Everybody does that. It's definitely one of those things where you just think like, wow, I could just make Sonic fucking shooting everyone in the face and I get so much money, but then it's like, I don't want to do that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:18.315 --> 0:56:21.066]: 
  There's also like, for example, like me and Jeff

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:21.066 --> 0:56:33.942]: 
  We've done parodies in the past, like we did the Street Fighter collab and we each did like Street Fighter pieces that we thought were funny. And we did it in sort of a way where if you liked Street Fighter you would laugh, if you didn't like Street Fighter you would laugh.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:33.942 --> 0:56:57.803]: 
  was the parody. And it's because we like Street Fighter, but I do know people that, I know at least two, maybe three people that constantly make Minecraft parodies, and they've never played Minecraft before. They don't even know what the fuck it is. They just know that if they do this, it'll give you monsters and stuff. And I don't like Pokemon and shit like that too.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:34.566 --> 0:56:35.444]: 
  That's exactly what I'm talking about.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:35.444 --> 0:56:36.962]: 
  And it's because we like you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:46.632 --> 0:56:47.560]: 
  Ja, ja.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:50.057 --> 0:57:30.422]: 
  They do this references to the monsters and stuff. It'll give you. I don't like Pokemon and shit like that too. I feel like I made the first Minecraft parody ever. You did? You look like that. I quit. I'm done. 2009 or something? It was pretty young. I did a... I thought it was pretty good too. I did a... Like when me and Stamper made Pokemon Spread, when we made that, our only motive was to get a point across that she farts and that's the only fucking joke. That's the only joke. It's just the build up is just too... Like as you could replace fucking the nurse with any other nurse, you could replace the kids with the kids just at the time. That's the point though. That's another... That's another... That's another point though.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:56:58.900 --> 0:57:03.642]: 
  He did. I mean, you look like 2000. I'm like, I'm done. I'm like, I'm done. God damn.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:27.537 --> 0:57:36.447]: 
  It's just at the time. That's important though. That's another key thing with like parody. If you can make a parody, this is really important. If you can make a parody cartoon.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:36.194 --> 0:57:40.497]: 
  and be able to replace any of the characters with any other characters in its still

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:40.497 --> 0:57:42.437]: 
  funny than you've got a but if

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:41.931 --> 0:57:52.140]: 
  But if you're isolating people where they don't understand I know references He's like an in-depth warhammer joke that only people who play warhammer understand and you've already killed yourself

 SPEAKER_04 [0:57:49.204 --> 0:57:49.947]: 
  I understand.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:57:50.537 --> 0:57:57.152]: 
  You've already killed yourself. But those characters, if you do know the characters of the franchise, that should be a bonus.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:56.562 --> 0:58:02.282]: 
  I barely know the Pokemon characters. I don't know the reason why I think it's funny.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:58.722 --> 0:58:11.243]: 
  I don't know the reason why I think it's funny. I literally only watched the show. I had like watched like 12 episodes. We mostly know the characters and then to put them in a position that we would see them in is funny to us.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:05.016 --> 0:58:06.197]: 
  Like we loosely

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:09.690 --> 0:58:27.477]: 
  Yeah, funny to us. I just don't understand parodies where it seems like necessary that, A, it's funny to everybody, and B, it's funnier to people who know the game or the movie or whatever that understand the reference is better, but it should be funny to everybody. Yeah, exactly. I've never seen it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:58:25.587 --> 0:58:30.885]: 
  Yeah, exactly. I've never seen Harry Platt before, but I laughed at Chris's stupid little Harry.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:29.940 --> 0:58:32.725]: 
  little

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:31.847 --> 0:58:47.946]: 
  There's parodies that are obsessed with being, you know, too many references and they're not funny to anybody that doesn't understand the reference. And then there's things that are used to characters, but they have nothing to do with the subject. To the point where it's like, why'd you do this? And I'm like, why? Where the hell did this idea even come from?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:44.031 --> 0:58:46.461]: 
  To the point where it's like why do you think this?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:47.946 --> 0:58:52.502]: 
  If you if you Paris will be alike and you do it like if you're not you know

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:52.502 --> 0:58:58.560]: 
  That's why I always make two characters fucking because everybody can understand that. Everybody needs to fuck. You know the characters. That's true.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:54.325 --> 0:58:57.109]: 
  because everybody can understand that. You know it's the fuck.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:58.560 --> 0:59:39.398]: 
  Or eating food something that's global on a base level. That's another thing It's relatability also in your cartoons like an idea where someone has to joke around the fact that they need to pay their bill or something Yeah, it's just like you do like a really childish thing and another thing I actually personally find funny is Being immature in a professional setting like if a scientist present or the president does something really immature to me That's funny because he's supposed to be professional yet He's acting like a fucking idiot and that's funny to me But it's obvious you're niche of what you find funny because a lot of people find certain things funny Well, it's all it's all completely. Yeah, I can't stay with humorous object

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:02.324 --> 0:59:02.948]: 
  That's another...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:02.948 --> 0:59:04.939]: 
  That's another thing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:13.157 --> 0:59:14.001]: 
  And it's just like...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:35.989 --> 0:59:41.440]: 
  Well, it's all completely subjective. I can't stay with people who would stop and go, oh, you love it. Yeah, that's the thing.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:40.950 --> 0:59:41.558]: 
  역시 쌤의 출발

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:41.558 --> 0:59:58.450]: 
  I always try to make cartoons where it's like, what are you doing in fucking Europe that doesn't understand this whole thing in America. So we got a really tightly knit idea of things out here. And you try to apply it to another. When some dude from Kenya is like, I really like your cartoons, man.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:55.699 --> 1:00:02.466]: 
  Kenya's like I really like it You're like what part did you fucking like? What the hell are you talking about?

  Where was it? Yeah, fucking Kenya. Yeah, like have you ever gone to...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:16.152 --> 1:00:30.344]:

 SPEAKER_04 [1:07:49.819 --> 1:08:02.914]:
