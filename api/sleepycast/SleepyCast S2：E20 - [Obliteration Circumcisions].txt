  Chris is like needs an orange screen right now. Yeah. Sorry. Anyway, also there's Cory. Everyone's lovable Oaf. Hey. Hey. Chris, did you know that being surrounded in red, like it will enraged you? Like being around red, cause I used to have, I used to actually have my room and my mom's used to be completely painted red because it used to be my sister's. She spent like four days painting it and then she ended up moving out a week later. So I moved in and the room was just pig blood red. It was just vile, vile red. What's the difference between pig blood and human blood? Pig blood is vibrant and glows. So it was really, it was just like this really creepy over the top red room and since I always just the glow of my screen with this vibrant red around me. Do you think it's better we record in a reddish orange room? Yeah, cause it's fucking. I like red rooms. It's this high stuff. I think red rooms are comfortable. I think a blue room would be too depressing. Blue would probably put us to shame. I grew up in a, in a blue room. I like, I, my room was like baby blue and I loved it. Let's talk about, wait, wait, wait. We talked about too many colors last time. No, Corey brought up a good point. Pig blood. Don't you just hate it when you see a movie and the blood looks like jam.

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:23.224 --> 0:04:24.810]: 
  I've never heard of interspace.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:28.455 --> 0:04:29.282]: 
  Oh

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:29.282 --> 0:07:39.329]: 
  Guy! No, it's like basically Martin Short gets, a guy gets put in Martin Short's body, accidentally. Oh, is that like the whole thing where it's like we need to shrink down and fix him from the inside? Yeah, but it's like a whole, it's like he's in a lab and then somebody breaks into a lab and steals the syringe with him in it and injects him into like the wrong person or something. Cool, that sounds sweet. Then it turns into an adventure comedy, where Martin Short acts quaggy. I've never heard of it, so it can't be that great, Jeff. It's alright. These over seven on Metacritic are good. Idiot. Metacritic. Have any of you ever watched a good movie in your entire lives? I've seen. I can't name any good movies out there. Interstellar! That was good. It was pretty sweet. Interstellar wasn't even that good. It was sweet though. It was cool to look at. It was soundtrack. I like the soundtrack a lot. I never saw Interstellar. The movie is sweet. I heard it makes messages from it. It was really long, but it looked nice the whole way through. I had a cool concept. Matthew McConaughey is a fucking... I could talk about this for a while, but let's just change the subject. I wanted to talk about something. I had an interesting topic this morning. Tell us your topic, Kari. Well, it was the discussion that came up. I think we were talking about mascots and how pointless they are nowadays. Pointless. Yeah, they're pointless. They're like mascots. But kids like mascots. Let me prove my argument. But you remember McDonald's or Ronald McDonald's? Yeah. They kind of got rid of all that. Nowadays it's become a kind of murky-ish brown college hangout room. It's just like this boring colors where people go to work and stuff. McDonald's? McDonald's is like brown now. What? But you do get McDonald's that are a mix of play places still. But for the most part, they're not as common as you'd think. They're actually more common of just having just the restaurant and they're just very bland. They take away the red. I mean, the red's always going to be in the happy meals. It's all for kids. You get the happy meals and it's red and yellow and bright and obnoxious. But for the parents, it's orange and yellow and brown. Are you telling me you're not a fan of the Hamburglar? No. I hate McDonald's. What about Grimmus? It's Burger King. Grimmus is fucking hot. They had the Burger King. Grimmus is a purple guy. Who's Grimmus Bologna? He's got a big hairy ass. Furry ass. Sorry. Let's not be sexist. You guys are actually right. When I was a kid, I never liked any of those mascots. When I was a small kid. Absolutely not. Grimmus is McDonald's. It's a purple. In Hamburglar, it's Burger King. No, they had it in McDonald's. The Burger King is Burger King. Oh yeah. Even that douchebag who smiles and they made terrible X-Files games. I did those Burger King commercials. Yeah, well, but they can't do that anymore because it's kind of cost prohibitive to use mascots. You're not as a kid though. It's just that how's the mass. It's like they have to like... It's a costume. It's just it doesn't really attract anyone anymore. Back then, I guess an argument would be like... Well, maybe corporate mascots or sports mascots are still popular. See, what I mean is I mean things like not like restaurants, places where people eat and stuff. You know, sports mascots are always going to be there because mascots are like entertaining for everybody, for families and stuff. But you also need mascots for cereals like tricks and like Captain Crunch. Why? What do you need? Count Chocula for kids. Because kids will see that and they'll be like, oh, the tricks rabbit.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:48.587 --> 0:04:50.072]: 
  Cool. That sounds sweet.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:52.637 --> 0:04:53.717]: 
  I've never heard of it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:59.539 --> 0:05:00.265]: 
  and medical.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:05.817 --> 0:05:08.449]: 
  Interstellar, that was good. It was pretty sweet.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:09.884 --> 0:05:10.845]: 
  It was sweet though.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:11.790 --> 0:05:14.069]: 
  I like the soundtrack a lot.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:14.929 --> 0:05:15.992]: 
  movie is sweet

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:15.992 --> 0:05:17.258]: 
  We're just messages from it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:19.705 --> 0:05:22.860]: 
  Cool concept. Matthew McConaughey is a fucking I could talk about this

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:24.750 --> 0:05:25.949]: 
  Well, I wanted to talk about something.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:25.999 --> 0:05:26.337]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:28.244 --> 0:05:29.003]: 
  Interesting.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:29.003 --> 0:05:30.555]: 
  Tell us your topic, Kori.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:37.744 --> 0:05:40.765]: 
  Yeah, like they're pointless.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:46.469 --> 0:05:47.903]: 
  They kind of got rid of all that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:51.514 --> 0:05:52.189]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:54.096 --> 0:05:54.653]: 
  where it's just like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:56.678 --> 0:05:58.973]: 
  The word in the tunnels? Yeah, the tunnels are like brown now.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:02.550 --> 0:06:02.820]: 
  Mm.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:23.273 --> 0:06:24.100]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:25.872 --> 0:06:29.196]: 
  What about Grimace? Burger King. Grimace is fucking hot. They had the burger.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:30.681 --> 0:06:31.255]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:31.255 --> 0:06:33.314]: 
  Wait, who's Grammys Belongue?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:35.997 --> 0:06:36.149]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:36.149 --> 0:06:38.005]: 
  Furrier, sorry. It's not being-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:38.005 --> 0:06:39.456]: 
  что нашего iTunes есть и просто на другом conjugении

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:42.780 --> 0:06:43.945]: 
  when I was a small kid.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:43.945 --> 0:06:47.286]: 
  Absolutely. Oh no, like Grimaces McDonald's. It's a purple.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:48.872 --> 0:06:50.999]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:52.534 --> 0:06:53.192]: 
  Oh yeah, whatever.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:54.981 --> 0:06:56.213]: 
  I did like this

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:57.816 --> 0:06:58.491]: 
  Yeah, well that's-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:58.491 --> 0:06:58.845]: 
  sort of.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:03.115 --> 0:07:03.959]: 
  Even as a kid though

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:05.781 --> 0:07:07.047]: 
  Well, it's like they have to like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:08.228 --> 0:07:09.561]: 
  It's just it doesn't really attract you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:09.443 --> 0:07:09.629]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:12.464 --> 0:07:12.902]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:09.072 --> 0:17:11.459]: 
  Oh, come on now. I'm not know you can look it up. It's true There's also accusations of like like the people dressed up that get caught like dittling kids and stuff So it's like it's like almost like a pedophile ring almost in its own way, but like people considered I wouldn't say that well it is because it's like where where you gonna? Okay? Think of it this way you're hungry for kids Where are you gonna go? You're not gonna go to fucking you go Chuck E cheeses or you can go to Disneyland take your pick Is they're both Harvard the most kids? It's what I play people go for dreams. I'd say fucking Disneyland is the most heavily Security camera place in the world it is but it's also like a place where people capture pedophiles Right, this is fact like people go there to meet kids And it's like the easiest place to catch pedophiles because they're just like you know They're hanging out waiting for kids and it's like you know obviously it is heavy But it's also like considered like one of the worst places to work like Disneyland is considered a horrible place Like I think it was so good mosh mouse wits or whatever it's they like that's the name Yeah, like there's this underground tunnel that all the mascots have to go through because they're not supposed to be seen going do you think that's like kind of

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:11.890 --> 0:16:12.902]: 
  There's also accusation.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:20.597 --> 0:16:23.044]: 
  But like people considered, I wouldn't say that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:39.126 --> 0:16:40.375]: 
  place in the world. It is.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:02.549 --> 0:17:05.991]: 
  That's the name. That's the happiest place on earth. That's the kids.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:10.058 --> 0:17:15.458]: 
  Do you think that's like kind of off Jeff Jeff just checked it. Man, I mean, he's a life.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:12.420 --> 0:17:40.754]: 
  Jeff Jeff you've spec checked it. I just saw it man, I didn't mean to laugh. Did you see the life feed of his face blown off? The Disney actor who won the hearts as Gaston has died in a fireworks accident over the weekend. According to the news that Devin Staples placed a fireworks mortar tube on his head and set it off. Oh I think the apple thing was they deserved it. What kind of fucking idiot is like who the... Gaston! That's just Gaston! That's not even like a freak accident. That's pretty much premeditated suicide. That's karma. That's what happened to you. No one blows up.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:28.688 --> 0:17:31.152]: 
  Oh, I think the apple thing was eating it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:33.059 --> 0:17:35.320]: 
  That's not even

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:39.775 --> 0:17:43.994]: 
  No one blows his own head up, you know? God damn it!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:43.994 --> 0:19:05.820]: 
  That happens to me. No one kills himself. No one blows his face like Gaston. No one charges his face like Gaston. No one dies like Gaston. Fuck that. No one croaks like Gaston. No one bows down to death. He f- He spreads like Gaston. No one blows off his hands like Gaston. In the world it's meek and shitty. I'm dead. I don't know the rest of it. This is mean. Yeah. I'd say that guy was the nicest, coolest guy ever. He seemed really charismatic. He bet he was drunk and decided to put fireworks in his hair. Harry's probably on fucking meth. I always feel bad for little kids whose parents let them have black cats. They always blow off their fingers with them every fucking year. It's like fucking parent you're kidding. Harry Potter with Roman Candle. Why would you give your kid fucking fireworks? It's so stupid. My dad had a friend like that. He'd come over for the four of the job. He'd light the M80s and he'd throw them so they'd blow up midair. That's crazy. It's stupid. Like I cannot stand that shit. Strong and loud little fucking explosive thing. There's always one guy who's like, you know, the fireworks master. And then they always like drop one and everyone runs fucking and explodes and kills everybody. I'm not even sure where they're legal anymore. I know they're legal on a few states but not here. They were illegal in my state but you had to go to like the woods. So you had to be on like an area away from town. So you go to the woods. The bottom where to use them. To use them. You have to go to the woods. In fairness. Just like you're fucking...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:55.485 --> 0:17:58.067]: 
  No way, brokes like this don't work.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:12.546 --> 0:18:12.850]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:12.850 --> 0:18:13.170]: 
  I'd say

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:13.761 --> 0:18:15.297]: 
  The nicest, coolest guy ever.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:19.482 --> 0:18:19.802]: 
  probably

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:25.084 --> 0:18:25.574]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:27.497 --> 0:18:30.315]: 
  You should play Harry Potter with Roman Candles with my candle words.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:37.977 --> 0:18:41.993]: 
  Yeah, that's what's hard. It's stupid. I cannot stand that shit

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:51.004 --> 0:18:51.460]: 
  Buddy.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:02.057 --> 0:19:09.854]: 
  You go to the woods to use them you like go to the woods like they probably should be regulated like they are explosives Yeah, no, I'm

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:09.449 --> 0:19:50.151]: 
  Absolutely, I think that's why they're illegal. I'm not really a fan of doing fireworks every fourth of July It's like all you hear all day is like And you're like, how are they not getting caught right? Cuz like even if you did get the fireworks you're not the richest man in the world So you're not gonna go out and get the $600 you can get the little shitty ones You're gonna have fun for like an hour They have a massive fireworks show really close to where I live and it's just my apartment is shaking for like 40 minutes Every fourth I just like oh my god stop not to mention like like Chris said like last the pre prior four days People are shooting fireworks off non-stop just never an after it

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:10.545 --> 0:19:11.288]: 
  They are.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:12.149 --> 0:19:12.975]: 
  I'm not really a fan.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:21.075 --> 0:19:24.012]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:54.370 --> 0:20:08.579]: 
  Yeah, you walk over to your window and look at you see one firework every five minutes You're like cool, so I bottle rockets are better because they're like they they're bottle rockets. So if there is any damage It's only gonna hurt you within a certain area. I'm afraid it fireworks. I don't like fireworks

  So I bottle it up.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:08.089 --> 0:20:12.443]: 
  I'm not afraid. I think they're kind of cool. I like the little black snake wire.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:12.443 --> 0:20:29.402]: 
  You ever see the video where the fireworks show had a malfunction and it set off 30 minutes of fireworks in about 5 seconds? Yeah, it's like smacking off cars going Just set the whole thing up in one like seconds and it just seems like a bomb going on. And the black guy's like, shit man!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:17.910 --> 0:20:21.269]: 
  It's key. Yeah, five seconds. That was insane.

Yeah, no like 20 to 30 grand. I would have saved probably a closer 20 30 grand for that Just because it's like paid fucking like you know, it's like a big event So it's like people all my parks and shit, but we're talking about fireworks. You know those like shitty tank fireworks They have like a they're like you see them when you're a kid you like wow a tank a tank that moves And then you turn it on and it flips over immediately and fucking explodes You know it has like all these I do that's like it's actually gonna roll.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:41.485 --> 0:20:42.936]: 
  I always wondered, I always thought someone was

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:42.936 --> 0:20:44.337]: 
  I was like, like, if I recall,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:48.674 --> 0:20:51.424]: 
  through all the switches. I guess for some reason.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:52.909 --> 0:20:53.905]: 
  They're testing it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:55.609 --> 0:20:57.128]: 
  And that costs a lot of money.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:56.099 --> 0:20:58.124]: 
  I lost a lot of money. That's a weird number.

  There's two villains in the Nickel Movie.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:39.226 --> 0:34:40.054]: 
  But it's like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:57.975 --> 0:34:58.465]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:54.979 --> 0:35:57.291]: 
  That was it. I guess it was factually accurate.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:57.848 --> 0:36:25.995]: 
  Dude, the fucking assholes in my school come up with creative ways to piss you off. Like, they turn your bag inside out and put all your books back in there. That's cool. That's really fucking annoying, because you're like, UGH! Or they'd like, they'd actually go really far. Like, they'd open two of your textbooks and, uh, like put one page in the page of another textbook and do that with every page so the book is stuck together. And it's like impossible to fucking- that happens. If you put one page in another page of a book, it gets stuck together. You can't pull it out. You wanna know how creative you are?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:04.935 --> 0:36:07.416]: 
  That's cool. You're really fucking annoying because you're like, Ugh!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:25.995 --> 0:36:36.542]: 
  of the guys in my school were how they put your bag on the floor and get ten of their friends circle around it and spit on it well man that's that's good to me but they did it to this guy and I've never been more angry

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:31.345 --> 0:36:33.893]: 
  Man, that's not even good. That's not even good.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:36.002 --> 0:36:56.944]: 
  But before school every morning we'd be we had got a school bus So we'd be early and everyone would stand outside in a circle and then someone would throw in like just say 50 cents And then someone would be like I want that 50 cents But I won't be in a circle and then someone else would throw in 50 cents and you'd like and then like it would get to enough Money where you'd want it so someone would go in to get it Everyone kicked living shit out of whoever went in to get it

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:56.944 --> 0:37:05.230]: 
  Do you remember stories of real like mean like a and especially mean case of bullying your school? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah, I was a bit I was kind of a bully

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:02.429 --> 0:37:09.651]: 
  Yeah, yeah, I was a bit I was kind of a bully at one stage that was to avoid me being bullied that are being bullied I was bullied, but I also in

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:08.335 --> 0:37:11.592]: 
  I was bullied but I also- You and Corey, the bully brothers here. No but-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:11.052 --> 0:37:15.203]: 
  No, but to survive I had to yeah like it's the survival of the fittest. Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:12.689 --> 0:37:34.474]: 
  Yeah, yeah like survival of the fittest. Yeah, you don't bully in The classified school to well to be fair like my Sort of upbringing everyone thinks like everyone experienced bowling I never experienced it I was who you were the bully no It's because my friends were the popular kids and also the nerds so I felt I would fit in with everybody So I didn't I didn't have a segregation. I was I was sad

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:17.160 --> 0:37:19.236]: 
  That's the classified school to pursue our...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:24.670 --> 0:37:25.176]: 
  I was

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:34.457 --> 0:37:35.993]: 
  I was actually like that too, I was friends with the cool...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:35.993 --> 0:39:22.947]: 
  and the fucking narratives. But the meanest thing someone ever did was it was almost like um, it was like this initiation thing at this place. It was like completely fucked up what they did, but the whole day they all spent time pissing in one of those giant blue barrels pissing. Yeah. Why? Where is this going? The whole day? Yeah. So in order to get like let him join the group or something, they told him to get in the barrel. A 50 gallon barrel. Yeah, I mean it was it was filled with piss and then they just ended up pouring like whatever like sewage water around them was there. Oh, dude. It was vile. And then they so they pulled it open and he got inside and they put the lid on and sat on top of it. That's horrible. And I mean I couldn't do anything because if I would have been like if I would have been like you guys are being jerks let it be free they would have shoved me in the barrel. Fucking Missouri. So after he came out, after they let him go, they dumped it all out and shit. They drove off without him so they just abandoned him there. And it was freezing out so we ended up getting like a really sick and then they had to pay for it that way. I just remember stupid ones like this kind of. So that's like the worst like I you know I don't understand bullying but that's more like a frat-ish bullying but it wasn't even for a frat. It was just a group of guys being assholes to this one guy who really wanted to be the friend. That's really fun to do. But the guy was like he was just this like harmless guy who liked to dance. He was like a goofy dancer. He was like everyone kind of like egged him on and ironically said oh you're the funnest dancer at our school. So he like thought he was like the coolest dancer and he was like you know that sort of like goofy not cool dancer and then they ended up fucking with him and yeah he so many times like these people like and they just end up moving away. Like every time there's real bullying happening they're just moving away before anything happens. They always get that one kid who dies. Oh man. From bullying.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:51.704 --> 0:37:52.024]: 
  Why?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:01.305 --> 0:38:01.491]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:01.491 --> 0:38:02.065]: 
  I mean it was

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:16.510 --> 0:38:17.607]: 
  if I would have been like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:37.199 --> 0:38:37.975]: 
  That's right.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:38.970 --> 0:38:39.004]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:39.004 --> 0:38:39.510]: 
  So that's like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:49.939 --> 0:38:50.496]: 
  I really wanted to be

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:50.496 --> 0:38:51.171]: 
  be the friend.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:09.919 --> 0:39:10.257]: 
  Mm.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:21.951 --> 0:39:29.055]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:22.947 --> 0:39:24.600]: 
  There's always the kid from the kid. No, no, no.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:24.179 --> 0:39:24.398]: 
  Oh no.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:26.777 --> 0:40:09.977]: 
  Well, there's three there was three kids who died at our school There was one kid who actually killed himself he hung himself in his room with a shoelace guy and Like it was literally six houses down from mine So it was at the end of the street and he hung himself a shoelace's then the parents moved out and the house sat abandoned forever And then the other kid got hit by a literally right near my fucking house There's this fucking like this lone road highway thing guy got hit on his bike by a fucking car What died like instantly so we got fucking killed by a car on his bike and then the other kid like in the park He had like a fucking asthma attack and he just died in the disease He just he didn't have his and he didn't have his inhaler with him. So he just suffocated and died in the woods

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:32.734 --> 0:39:33.814]: 
  Oh my god.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:59.160 --> 0:40:00.038]: 
  And then the other

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:09.977 --> 0:40:24.794]: 
  There's a weird epidemic where I was from like every all these kids would die just from playing sports and their heart would stop That happened with you Chris is like Ireland like it was just The fucking right on and go away. Yeah, all these kids would play sports and their hearts would just stop

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:16.710 --> 0:40:16.997]: 
  I think

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:16.997 --> 0:40:17.993]: 
  It was in Ireland.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:17.993 --> 0:40:21.773]: 
  I think it's probably the fucking radon in Galway.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:24.794 --> 0:44:24.030]: 
  Fuckin, uh, you wanna know a great bullying story? Sure. Staring yours truly? Sure. This is real, like this is real life. It's not like the internet. Yeah. Cause I have a really, like not, not showed, but like an actual situation where I egged this person on to a point where I actually was just like, okay, I need to stop. Yeah. Okay, so I'll give you a little, kinda like timeline. I was suspended from YouTube. So I made a new account called Chain Reaction where I would purposely just fuck with kids online. Oh, you'd make a Chain Reaction? I would go to Recolors and then I'd take their video audio and stick it over game footage. If I'm like screaming at people with like game footage. And there was this one guy who I pinpointed. I picked, I grabbed him because, okay, to clarify, this was like 2008, 2009. Oh no, this was way back. This was like 2007, 2008. So this is like way the fuck back then. This was like during the process of like Chode's existence. This was like prior year before Chode. Chode was even made before this. So this was way back then. Yeah. But there was this one guy, at least I think it was, there was this one guy. I took his video because he was talking to us. So he's like, you better, he's like, you fucker, you better leave my friend alone, you fucking bitch. And it was like, he had this like recolor of like a stolen picture of Sonic scribbled with like MS Paint and stuff. And so I'm like, okay, so I took the audio and I slapped my keyboard and I found a video of a baby crying. So I took his video and I overlaid it perfectly with a baby sitting in his crib, like looking up at like somebody. Then he like, right when he's like, you little bitch, the baby started like fucking scream crying. So he was like, he was like actually like crying. The camera like zooms in while the kid was like talking. And then I sent it to him and I'm like, I sent it to him. I think I had a caption like wall. And then he fucking, he like messaged me. He's like, take, he made another video. And he's like, train reaction. He's making videos about me making fun of babies. And I do not scream at babies. And then I took that audio and put it with another baby crying. And then I sent it to him and eventually it got to the point where I ended up adding him because he added me. And he didn't know like I was spaz kid. He didn't know spaz kid. So he thought chain reaction was his own identity. So I was talking to him and he's like, do you know chain reaction? Because I told him I was spaz kid. I'm like, yeah, yeah, he's, he stole all my videos. And he's like, he's been proposing as me for years. I just sort of left. And he's like, yeah, well, he's a jerk. Let me tell you what he's been doing. So I ate this whole thing on and Lyle actually helped with this too. And so Lyle ended up convincing him that I was taken out of my family into. Wait, you as spaz kid or you as chain reaction? Chain reaction was a boy who played the role. I think I talked about this because I talked about sonic mega pictures. I never heard this. Okay. Who's going down roads? I don't know. Okay, okay. So funny though. And so Lyle, there was this, there was this voice actor named sonic mega. Well, Lyle would take his pictures of sonic mega and pretend it was fucking me. And he would be like, so he'd have pictures, but he would contradict himself because like, he would say he's like, you know, he's like super gay, but then he would like have pictures of him with like, pointing at a sign with like a kissy face being like crazy girlfriend. And he's like, well, he like, he has a crazy girlfriend. Well, he's so gay. And so I would fucking, we would just tell him lies. People like, yeah, he smuggles cocaine. He smuggles kilo, kilo, what is it? Kilograms? Kilograms. Yeah, he smuggles kilograms of cocaine, but he didn't understand the idea of what a kilogram is. He thought it was a kilometer. So he's like, so he makes like videos where he's like, he also smuggles kilometers of cocaine across states. He's like, he's bad. And he's like, look at him trying to, like he has like, he had like a videos of him like trying to voice act. Is that like sonic mega? Like, yes, it was sonic mega. This is the worst episode we've ever done. I know. Continues. So the whole point is we convinced him that he lived in France. I mean, like smuggled cocaine for a living and his name was Gresne Gerlover.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:27.409 --> 0:40:27.780]: 
  Sure.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:29.316 --> 0:40:29.333]:

  I know. Continue.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:26.376 --> 0:44:53.224]: 
  His first name is Gresnik and his second name is Erlover. Yeah, Gresnik-er-lover. So we told him... What's Gres? What does Gresnik-er-lover mean? Lyle thought of that. I don't know. Lyle thought of it. He's like... It was just because it says Gresnik-er-lover. Gresnik. So he would... We would be in Skype chats all the time. And he would send me pictures of him writing his name down in death notes. And he's like... He's like... Wrote his name down again. I hope he gets kicked by the car this time. Yeah!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:28.570 --> 0:44:30.426]: 
  It's Nick, we love her.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:51.891 --> 0:44:52.583]: 
  He's fine.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:53.224 --> 0:45:01.392]: 
  So there's this kid who hates this made up imaginary guy called Gresneger Erlover who was Sonic Mega smiling half-wheat.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:59.485 --> 0:45:24.645]: 
  Sonic Mega, just smiling happily. Well, it's just a simple Sonic Mega. It's just like, you know, his like, bus shots of him being happy at like, voice academies. And he's like, he probably sucks acid voice acting and shit. Just completely shi- this- nobody knows what he looks like. And he's just like- Poor Sonic Mega, why'd you do that for him? Well, he's writing Chris Nigorlover down in the death note, so it's okay. In the death note? He has death notes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:16.934 --> 0:45:17.170]: 
  Well, here's the thing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:22.772 --> 0:45:26.451]: 
  He has death notes. Yeah, he has death notes. That's why it's so fucking funny.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:24.645 --> 0:45:25.844]: 
  That's why it's so funny.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:26.451 --> 0:45:30.299]: 
  This is such unbelievable faggots. You can't even fucking believe it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:30.147 --> 0:47:45.957]: 
  At the end of the day, he made so many videos where he was like, he would like try to reveal information, but we would just mislead him every single video and contradict him all the time. And he would release more parts and more parts. And eventually it got to the point where I was like, okay, we've been doing this for like a week, this needs to stop. And so I went into a call with him and I brought him in and I'm like, I'm done. I'm Spaz Kid, chain reaction. I've been fucking with you. You've been punked. And then I hung up on him. And then he called me back and he's like, I realize now that I've made a fool of myself, but do you think we can still be friends? And I'm like, no, I don't want to be friends with you. And then I kind of like left and then he still like, he still adds me to the day. Sounds like Chris's pal, Genesis Valentine. No, it's- Cory, you better watch it. But your name is- This sounds pretty like, you know what? We're being- you sound really mean spirited in this whole- Well, this is like, well, it is what it is, man. You do stuff for your- I'm just gonna have to bully you guys. And I go for it. We're just gonna have to like, they could face value when you're a fucking 17 year old, you're cunt. Yeah, we were all malicious. I was a malicious troll, okay? Fucking sweet. I was like, you're better now. Yeah, I'm no longer- I no longer find enjoyment in fucking with kids who are younger than me. Yeah, me neither, it's it. I feel like it's kind of like a little creepy for me as an adult. You totally do grow- Yeah, don't you definitely grow out of that though, don't you? There's too many things to worry about in life than seeing what these little kids are tracing. Like, it's like, who cares? You definitely grow out of that shit. So yeah, I fucked with him, but he adds me back and he still is as quirky as ever. It's so bizarre, he'll add me and say stuff. Like, he's like, I'm changing my name to Wolf Slayer. I know it's corny, I don't care, deal with it. And I'm like, cool, dude. And then he changes his name back and he's like, I'm sorry I bothered you, I won't bother you again. And then he removes his name and his picture. And I'm like, dude, I didn't care. And he's like, okay, I'm just checking. And I'm just like, I don't know if I should respond to this person or if I should just wipe it away. Just be like, I'm done, I can't keep up. Like, I had no ill will towards him. I want him to do what he wants, but he just don't care. I don't want to be reminded of fucking with people. Jeff, how would you like to talk about diets? Well, diets. Diets. What's dieting? It's when you lose weight because you're so fat. Oh, I thought it's when you die. I'm trying to get in shape for a bikini season at the beach.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:13.836 --> 0:46:15.912]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:31.225 --> 0:47:31.410]: 
  Después de los días este

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:40.658 --> 0:47:41.957]: 
  I'm trying to...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:44.927 --> 0:47:53.331]: 
  Okay, no, but seriously, diets, me and Nile have a lot of experience being the fat chubby fucking... Yeah, I've been fat and chubby, I've been scrawny, I've been everything.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:50.631 --> 0:48:25.090]: 
  I've been fat and chubby, I've been scrawny, I've been everything. What about, okay, my problem is like, there's certain diets, like soup diets. I don't want to go on a diet where eventually it's just gonna become like harmful to the, to my lower half. What is like the Lubos ludicrous diets? Like, that you, I'll just eat bacon all day. Me and Nile did um, uh, we did keto. Keto is when you don't eat any carbs or sugar, you just eat vegetables and meat. And it makes you feel like the lowest pond scum shit on the planet. But you lose the weight really quickly. You lose like, like sometimes like three pounds a day by doing it. What about, I can, That's the same shit really. It's almost, I think it's,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:01.684 --> 0:48:02.005]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:22.592 --> 0:48:28.144]: 
  What about that can that's the same shit? I think it's it there's a few different like discrepancies, but it's pretty much I just think the other

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:27.520 --> 0:49:21.368]: 
  I just think the idea of eating nothing but meat sounds just It's disgusting your books are like fucking putrid. It's horrible So your body was not meant to be eaten a bunch of different meats You're meant to be eaten that's another dinosaur meat and like deer meat You lose that on a lot of you lose that on a lot of like things like iron and zinc and all this other shit If you only eat one food type it's weird that your body craves certain things like you know a lot of nights I'll just eat a plate of plain chicken and broccoli. Yeah, but you know, even if it's a healthy Even though it's a lot. I still feel like my body's like I really need something else Sometimes I crave really weird shit like I have a craving for like horrible stuff Like I know that'll be bad for me like sometimes we're just like I just want to fucking McDonald's burger I just want the worst thing ever or I just want to eat a TV dinner It's like why would I why the fuck would I ever want to eat a TV dinner cravings for TV dinner?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:24.683 --> 0:50:50.316]: 
  Look, listen, the easiest way to lose weight, there's so many factors to it, right? It's one, fucking work out. Just do a little bit, do 10 minutes, right? Also, don't eat carbs at all. No, fuck, like we're eating sub-weight, that is carbs, but the more carbs you eat, the more fat you will be. So if you eat just vegetables, meat, and a little fruit, that you'll lose weight the fastest by doing that, and you'll feel the best by doing that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:32.479 --> 0:50:32.901]:

  We have a Democrat in office. Everyone's put it's the purification of America.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:41.813 --> 0:59:26.168]: 
  classification of America I believe you know how people believe it they just just make some feel special they just like oh my special points I get to say I have like nothing against it but I have something against it when you have to be obnoxiously vocal about how special you are it's like just enjoy a lot of words raised that way they don't know anybody yeah they're gonna be the fucking it's just so funny just knowing reality is inevitably gonna hit these people in the face with a bat because you can't exist in this harsh world with these sensitive feelings and really get by very long yeah well if you're if you're the kind of person and that's a thing too like if you're the kind of person who you know you're willing to make that step of transitioning into like you know transitioning then you're gonna have to deal with the fact that not everybody's gonna accept it and if they do like you're just not to be able to turn a cheek like there was somebody who I used to watch who transitioned and but transitioned and pretty much left the internet because of all the hate but it's kind of like well if you're gonna be doing that stuff it's probably best to have a thick skin or understand the concept that people will still be prejudiced against the idea of it so you know and it also really helps not to read negative comments if you're trying to avoid negative comments what do you think the problems are gonna be in the future like a hundred years from now future yeah that's not a tough question never mind all raping people out of virtual reality everybody I wonder some oh my god that will be man is gonna just gonna be too annoying a hundred years in the future for they're gonna create I got raped in G. they're gonna create robots once they once people like once they figure out how to peep for people to not die anymore society I almost fear what humanity is gonna turn into because I was gonna be no more danger anywhere for anything nobody's gonna die nobody's gonna feel pain anymore that's what he said it's gonna be like it's just gonna know do you think it'll be

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:45.441 --> 0:57:45.711]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:55.212 --> 0:57:58.941]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:23.940 --> 0:59:28.547]: 
  Just gonna know do you think I'll be peace and harmony and happiness now?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:27.585 --> 0:59:38.942]: 
  No, there's always gonna be somebody fighting over something. There's a little like link in your brain. Just like one little wire that if you snip it, you stop feeling pain. Emotional pain or physical pain? This is called closeness. No, you're nerfing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:36.276 --> 0:59:36.951]: 
  emotional pain.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:36.495 --> 0:59:42.047]: 
  Pain or

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:40.124 --> 0:59:43.161]: 
  Yeah, but they link back to the brain though.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:42.857 --> 0:59:48.089]: 
  Yeah, so if you cut off those nerves then I mean but there's so many nerves that are

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:45.490 --> 0:59:46.165]: 
  I mean,

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:47.245 --> 1:00:05.605]: 
  There are genetic disorders where people don't feel physical pain. That must be weird. I think that's a good thing. It's more of a good thing than a bad thing, except that you can be resting your hand on a fucking burning hot oven for like 10 minutes straight. Yeah, but you're fucking gonna eat bone. That's what I did yesterday a few days ago. Yeah, I put my arm on a burning stove.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:51.126 --> 0:59:51.447]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:51.447 --> 0:59:52.999]: 
  I think that's a good thing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:52.999 --> 0:59:53.252]: 
  I'm not sure what you're saying. I'm not sure what you're saying. I'm not sure what you're

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:55.412 --> 0:59:56.307]: 
  Like resting your head.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:58.737 --> 1:00:12.203]: 
  Yeah, but you're fucking you I did yesterday a few days ago. Yeah, I put my arm on a burning stove I was in Stanford's house, and I was lighting a cigarette on the stove. Yeah, I singed my eyebrows and my hair went on fire That's stupid. Why would you why would you?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:11.190 --> 1:00:19.139]: 
  Why would you light a cigarette on stuff? Because we didn't have any fuego. Yeah, but you could have just take a crumbled up piece of paper, put it near the fire, and then did that. Oh.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:14.768 --> 1:00:15.342]: 
  Yeah, but you could

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:19.139 --> 1:00:24.285]: 
  Well, the real answer is I'm stupid. We're one more hypothetical. Hypothetical?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:21.754 --> 1:01:21.492]: 
  Hypothetical hypothetical like Superman thing with different. Oh Superman like a hypothetical. Yeah, just oh What would you do if you were if you could do? Oh, what if you were Harry Potter and Harry Potter? But we were a wizard. Yeah, what if you were a wizard what how what Hogwarts house would we join? Okay? You would 100% being Slytherin or he would be in Ravenclaw. What's Ravenclaw? Like for funny Chris Chris would be in Hufflepuff because I'm a faggot. Why would that hat choose syllabus? Why would I be in Slytherin because you are a cunt? I think you're gonna have a goal. The hat would be like different door. He's funny guy put him in Huffle door Jeff bed. Oh, I got one soon. I'd be like Jeff you go with Slytherin because you are a cunt I'd be like that Drake. What is Drake? I drink okay, dad You guys follow me around

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:29.399 --> 1:00:30.225]: 
  Oh, what if-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:36.368 --> 1:00:37.161]: 
  What if we were a wizard?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:37.161 --> 1:00:37.431]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:38.444 --> 1:00:38.815]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:40.739 --> 1:00:41.245]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:44.991 --> 1:00:45.885]: 
  Ravenclaw.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:48.906 --> 1:00:51.454]: 
  Chris will be in Hufflepuff because I'm a faggot.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:56.129 --> 1:01:00.449]: 
  I think you have a heart of gold. The hat would be like, he's funny guy.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:00.499 --> 1:01:00.702]: 
  What do you mean by that?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:02.204 --> 1:01:03.975]: 
  This is sound like that.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:02.507 --> 1:01:03.435]: 
  This is sound like the

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:09.612 --> 1:01:10.101]: 
  So that'd be like.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:14.910 --> 1:01:17.070]: 
  You'd have making a snapper fall on you around.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:19.484 --> 1:01:23.888]: 
  I would be like Slytherin House. I would be in Hufflepuff because I'm weak and not that clever.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:22.926 --> 1:01:26.082]: 
  That's clever. What is- what do- what do they do in Hufflepuff?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:25.997 --> 1:01:29.204]: 
  Okay, this is literally how Harry Potter's world explains it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:27.449 --> 1:02:01.958]: 
  Harry Potter's world explains it. Gryffindor is for the brave and courageous, right? They've led up their wands. Ravenclaw is the quick-witted and funny, right? Okay. Um, Slytherin is the purebloods. Okay. As in the fucking, like, we... Jerks, jerk, and all purebloods are jerks. They're all cunts. They're all evil cunts. Hufflepuff is the rest, which means they're faggots who can't find anywhere else to be. I was wondering what Hufflepuff was about. That's why it's called Hufflepuff. Was there ever a character in any of the books or the movies from Hufflepuff? Yeah, there's lots. I'm Ravenclaw. Okay. Cedric Diggory was in Hufflepuff.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:30.874 --> 1:01:32.224]: 
  They've light up their wands.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:32.224 --> 1:01:33.034]: 
  Ravenclaw is the best.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:43.311 --> 1:01:45.893]: 
  They're all controls. They're all evil cunts. Puff a puff.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:49.217 --> 1:01:49.605]: 
  as well.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:50.989 --> 1:01:51.765]: 
  That's why it's called...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:56.406 --> 1:01:57.992]: 
  There's lots some Ravens

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:57.503 --> 1:01:58.954]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:00.912 --> 1:02:05.434]: 
  What is that fucking French one in here?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:03.089 --> 1:02:30.949]: 
  He got murdered by the evil evil guy. Yeah, Voldemort's Olds of Morse. What if I'm really bad at magic? And plus Harry Potter land is like it's hard to like maneuver the staircases. It is bullshit That's why they just gave up on that concept after like the second movie. I kind of like the paintings I like the moving paintings. Yeah, no, I thought it was really cool like when you first go into like the Hogwarts It's just like insane. It's just insane. It's like this abandoned almost like haunted school. Man, it's so weird.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:09.214 --> 1:02:10.480]: 
  What if I'm really bad at magic?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:14.732 --> 1:02:14.817]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:17.753 --> 1:02:19.052]: 
  second movie.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:20.639 --> 1:02:20.959]: 
  Yes!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:29.279 --> 1:02:40.045]: 
  Man, if some fucking game developer develops that for the Oculus Rift, like Hogwarts, that would be the best fucking thing ever. Someone make that. Please, you make me. Yeah, someone make Hogwarts a good word.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:34.510 --> 1:03:45.722]: 
  That would be the best fucking thing. Someone make that. Please, you make this. Yeah, someone make Hogwarts a good word. Where is Hogwarts? Somebody explain, is it just in an invisible- It's in New Zealand. It's in the middle of fucking England or Wales somewhere. It's in Wales. And it's invisible to the common model. Wales is on the other side of the world. Alright, so it's just invisible. It's behind a dark soul smoke screen. In the book they say that they put a spell on it so it looks like a ruin so people don't go near it. Gotcha. A ruin? A ruin. Oh, that's genius. Fucking uh... What are they? I hate the concept of the paintings though because in the Harry Potter world, right, you could be in Dumbledore's office, right, he's got all these paintings on the wall. You could go in there and you could stare at your gun off and you look up and you're like, oh shit, they're looking at me. They can run out of that room into the paintings and the hall. But it's not like the soul of somebody. It's weird, it's creepy, but they're still alive and they're not dying. It's like a duplicate. They feared death. Because in the third one, one of the paintings gets ripped up and she's like hysteric and crying and they can't find her. Here's a question. What is the point of the paintings? No, you graduate A-plus in Wizarding School. Now what? Do you get a job somewhere as a wizard? You could be an horror. You go back. You could be a professional quidditch player.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:42.441 --> 1:02:45.175]: 
  It's in New Zealand. It's in the middle of fucking England or something.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:47.504 --> 1:02:51.959]: 
  It feels better. Well, listen to the other side of the word. All right, so it's just invisible. It's behind a dark.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:53.612 --> 1:02:54.827]: 
  in the book they say that they put

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:58.185 --> 1:02:59.451]: 
  A room? A room.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:02.927 --> 1:03:03.569]: 
 これでいい!

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:16.529 --> 1:03:17.001]: 
  do final

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:18.874 --> 1:03:20.629]: 
  That's what I'm saying. It's weird.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:22.047 --> 1:03:23.093]: 
  or not, th- Just a

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:24.561 --> 1:03]: 
  You're do-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03 --> 1:03:26.451]: 
  They feared death.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:31.159 --> 1:03:31.581]: 
  Here's a question.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:38.804 --> 1:03:41.942]: 
  Now what, do you get a job somewhere?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:44.980 --> 1:03:50.430]: 
  What else? You can be a magic baker. You can work at Gringotts if you're a little- Fun! How do you make money being a wizard?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:48.102 --> 1:04:04.791]: 
  How do you make money being a wizard? You start your Let's Play channel. The Ministry of Magic. They make it like Jeff, what? You start your Let's Play channel. I'm serious too. You're a witch. I studied my whole life.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:51.882 --> 1:03:53.451]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:12.477 --> 1:05:53.230]: 
  So it's a very high-class trolling school. It's trolling. You're learning how to troll people. Cory, you would fucking shove your one up your ass and be like, Lumos Maximus and then your whole body would glow red. Whoa. That sounds like a good use of my time. Nothing about this whole wizarding world makes any sense. What do you mean? It makes perfect sense. You have like a forest filled with spiders that kill students. Represents of the school. Teachers and groundskeepers constantly send students into a forest with spiders that want to eat them. Yeah, it's the forest. It's the forbidden forest. You're not supposed to do one. They have a team sport that doesn't make any fucking sense. That doesn't make sense.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:26.415 --> 1:05:26.820]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:29.065 --> 1:05:31.140]: 
  Nothing about this whole wizarding world makes sense.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:32.288 --> 1:05:32.625]: 
  What do you mean?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:33.672 --> 1:05:33.840]: 
  Yeah.

Okay, so you shut up, you go into the bathroom, she's right there, you're like, holy is creasiest, and there's a hole that it creates, and then you stick your dick through it, and then you fuck, because it's a- Glory hole. Yeah, you created Glory Hole on the opposite side, and now you have- But what if the magic wears off and it closes in and chops your dick off?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:01.894 --> 1:07:49.262]: 
  It's not a very well-made up-duty trick. Don't these wizards wanna- Don't they feel bad about these goddamn murdered ghosts floating around the hallways all day? No. They don't wanna help them? And- and that- Don't try to ride one. No, the- the- the ghosts in the universe, when someone dies, you have a choice. You have the choice to move on or become a ghost forever. Okay. So you can stay in the world and you can still communicate with the people, but you can never move on. Yeah, but what if some tixter goes up to your picture and just rips your fucking, like, a piece of your painting off, you're gone forever? Exactly. So someone could just be drunk one day and just, like, fuck a- AHH! Smashin' shit with beer bottles and ripping up all the pictures, cause they're poor. It'd be horrifying. What's- what's like a good real world spell that would actually help you do something? Lumos. You have somebody- Lumos is really, uh, like a hand-meat. So it's like a flashlight. It's a flashlight.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:19.765 --> 1:07:20.389]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:24.422 --> 1:07:25.907]:

  Yeah, yeah, it's Harry Potter 8 is like a play. I know nothing about Harry Potter. Harry Potter is awesome. You're an idiot.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:08.903 --> 1:10:55.512]: 
  I know nothing about Harry Potter. Harry Potter is awesome. You're an idiot. I am an idiot. I only saw up to, I saw the first one and Goblin of Fire. Oh, what? Okay, one is a great movie. Two is a great movie. Three is a great movie. Four is the worst film ever. Five is an okay movie. Six is a good movie. Seven and 7.2 is good movies. Holy fuck. Four is the worst movie ever. Which one's four? The one you saw. Goblin of Fire. No, I didn't see that one. I saw the one with the snakes in the basement. That's the one with the vampire die at the end. What vampire? He played a vampire. What's his name? Nosferatu. Gary Oldman. No, Serious Black. He was in the Teen Vampire movies. What were they called? Oh, fucking Edward. Oh, he's talking about Edward.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:17.070 --> 1:10:19.230]: 
  That's... Oh, what? Okay, four is...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:31.245 --> 1:10:31.499]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:31.499 --> 1:10:32.005]: 
  We're gonna go polls first.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:32.865 --> 1:10:33.456]: 
  No, I didn't.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:34.992 --> 1:10:36.004]: 
  That's the one of the...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:36.004 --> 1:10:37.675]: 
  The vampire died at the end.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:44.290 --> 1:10:44.931]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:45.842 --> 1:10:46.163]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:46.163 --> 1:10:46.551]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:52.862 --> 1:10:56.440]: 
  Oh, fucking, oh, he's talking about that. He's talking about sex.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:56.440 --> 1:13:24.957]: 
  Cedric Diggory. Cedric Diggory. Twilight. Yeah. Yeah, he dies in the fourth world. What if I just wanted to steal a bunch of magical animals and open a magical animal zoo? You probably could. You could pedal them. Then I could. Yeah. It's perfect. You could sell them for like $15,000 to rich people. What if I wanted to sell hippogriff hooves and grind them up and sell them to Africans for bad strings? What's hippogriff? You know what? JK Rowling wrote it so that Harry was born in 1980. So he's like 20 by the end of the books or whatever. So the book ends right as the age of internet begins, which is very convenient. So in the world of Harry Potter, there's giants roaming around. There's fucking hippogriffs flying around. There's dragons. But no one ever sees them. But you would think in the age of the internet at least one person would get it and upload it to YouTube and they would be fucked. So there's no internet? Not yet in Harry Potter. Do you think she'd make another Harry Potter movie with like, bring back what's-his-face? The new Harry Potter generation? Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel Radcliffe is the new wizard. We'll have like cool wizards. It'll be almost like the exact opposite, like Amazing Spider-Man where the first one was like a nerd, this guy comes back, he's like a cool pretty boy, he's like really cool and he has to do his hair when he comes inside. Yeah, big stick out. He's got his psychic. He's a little like Mowgli guy with orange hair. What's his name? Ron Weasley? Yeah, Ron Weasley. Ron Weasley's like this ripped Calvin Klein model. He's just like, yeah I think I'm gonna fuck what's her name? Hermione. Hermione. And then they just start off the season, he's already dating Hermione. It's almost like Twin Peaks or like fucking like- Emma Watson became the most unfathomably annoying feminist ever. Really? Yeah. Emma Watson. She's the Hermione. Oh, God. She's became Lady. What a name. A lost cause. What if technology companies got into making wizard wands? Like they're really high tech. They could probably do that now. I guess what do they have inside them again? Like hair or feathers or something? What's the catalyst? Yeah, it's like a feather. It's like a magic essence for magic beings. Wait, you mean what makes a wand? Yeah. They're all different so there's one is like- Oh, it's like the base is like a tree so it's like- Elm with a bit of heart string from a dragon. Or like feather from a phoenix. Okay. It's just like oak. You just need like dragons and legendary creatures and already keep magic. I agree with the tooth of a basilisk, that kind of shit. So if you open your magic shop you can have your downstairs where you have your dragon locked up like in Shrek. And Mr. O'Levander's like- So if I stuffed like- The wand chooses the wizard Harry. If I stuffed dog hair in a tree branch. That would be the shittiest wand.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:58.380 --> 1:10:58.718]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:00.220 --> 1:11:00.507]: 
  What is it?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:00.507 --> 1:11:01.553]: 
  What if...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:10.615 --> 1:11:11.374]: 
  What if

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:16.875 --> 1:11:18.192]: 
  What's hip for good luck?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:30.089 --> 1:11:30.730]: 
  which is very con-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:42.677 --> 1:11:45.765]: 
  and they will be fucked. So, yeah. So there's no internet.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:42.694 --> 1:11:43.150]: 
  and they will be fine.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:44.939 --> 1:11:45.462]: 
  There's no internet.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:51.199 --> 1:11:52.937]: 
  the new Harry Potter generation.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:52.937 --> 1:11:53.460]: 
  Yeah, I agree.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:07.214 --> 1:12:08.580]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:47.055 --> 1:12:48.119]: 
  That's like the catalan-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:48.119 --> 1:12:48.945]: 
  It's like a feather

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:48.945 --> 1:12:49.452]: 
  It's like a-

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:50.447 --> 1:12:51.679]:
