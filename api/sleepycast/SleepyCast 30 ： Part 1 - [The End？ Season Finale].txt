  is the sleepy cast season finale, featuring Stamper, Rice Pirate, Oni, Psychic Pebbles, Spaz Kid, Nile, Johnny Utah, and Tom Fulp. My name is not really Captain Dickhead. I have been living a lie. All my stories, everything I've ever said, it is a lie. One day the truth will be revealed. But not today. I have a doctor's appointment because my peepee is coming out like cottage cheese. See you in another life.

  Bye.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:40.457 --> 0:01:01.500]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own. Impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense. A world enveloped by a seemingly unending ocean of forests. Buried deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little cabin. And in that cabin...

 SPEAKER_06 [0:01:01.500 --> 0:01:09.516]: 
  Jesus shut up! God! It's a season finale! It's a sleepy cast season finale! God fuck!

  so I'm gonna see you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:18.392 --> 0:01:55.146]: 
  More powerful than a grizzly, more agile than a cougar, with reflexes faster than two cobras. Combined, it is the evolutionary bridge between man and beast and Sasquatch. Enter the domain of the North American Sasquatch, towering nearly one and a half inches over the typical brownstone Sasquatch. Set, wait, Sasquatch? Or Sasquatch? Fine, whatever. Next week, as Discovery takes you deep within the vicious web of sex, lies and drugs that is the secret world of the North American Sasquatch, only on Discovery.

We've answered this before, so we're gonna blaze through it. Go, Jeff. In 2004, I needed a job, and I searched Flash and Google, and Newgrounds came up, and then I asked Tom for a job, and he said yes.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:04:38.952 --> 0:04:41.939]: 
  Yes, and then I worked here. Perfect. That's how I found out.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:04:40.319 --> 0:04:40.437]: 
  PERFECT.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:04:40.437 --> 0:04:48.334]: 
  That's how it turned out. Yeah. Um, um, uh, Hentai Meat and Fuck games in Mario and Sonic vs. Sprite collabs. You're doing so well. We're doing so well.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:04:46.731 --> 0:04:53.565]: 
  You were doing it all the time. What coin set? What coin set? What coin set? What have you done? Go go go go go! In 2005 I was, I tried to make a video.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:04:53.565 --> 0:04:58.949]: 
  cartoons about a little character that was a tomato and he'd always get sliced up at the end.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:58.949 --> 0:05:05.057]: 
  When I put them on Newgrounds, that was it. When I was 14, my friend Paul showed me a website.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:05.057 --> 0:05:10.086]: 
  and retired animal babies and I kept going on. In like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:08.905 --> 0:05:28.935]: 
  in like 1999 I stumbled upon it because I was looking for funny animated gifts and then I found an animated gift that had sounded it and I was like holy shit wait what oh shut up what no but it was flash oh okay yeah it was what I thought was an animated gift but it had sound in it and it was on new grounds and that was before the automated portal even

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:18.659 --> 0:05:19.587]: 
  Wait what?

 SPEAKER_05 [0:05:28.935 --> 0:05:39.482]: 
  Oh you mean like most of our cartoons that people just rip and fucking post He said he said he saw a gift that was with sound and he couldn't believe that sound was on a gift Yeah, you don't understand the concept of

 SPEAKER_06 [0:05:32.800 --> 0:05:35.601]: 
  He said he saw a gift.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:37.795 --> 0:05:37.812]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_07 [0:05:37.812 --> 0:05:40.191]: 
  Yeah, you don't understand the concept of a dots and then

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:38.723 --> 0:05:46.064]: 
  And then Tom started adding my flashes early before the automated shitty...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:42.857 --> 0:05:42.908]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_05 [0:05:42.908 --> 0:05:43.212]: 
  예.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:05:45.422 --> 0:06:08.895]: 
  You know Tom always says in his sleep like while he's lying in bed He always says he likes you the best. Tom's a little bitch. Yeah. Alright, I found new grounds through... I love Tom, I'm just kidding! An ego raptor video we posted on YouTube that said stop watching Mike Karchings on YouTube Go to new grounds because it's better. Jon Tooby asked, Who do you hope to have on season 2 of the podcast? Stamper?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:52.425 --> 0:05:52.442]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:52.442 --> 0:05:53.235]: 
  Je te filme d'argent!

 SPEAKER_04 [0:06:03.209 --> 0:06:04.525]: 
  John 2B asked.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:06:09.959 --> 0:06:23.695]: 
  Oh my god, that speed at which that fucking answer came out.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:06:22.497 --> 0:06:54.441]: 
  answer came out. That was amazing. Amazing. You know I'm just moving on. Talk the rest of that question. Moving on. Travis Powell asks, if an investor approached Sleepy Cabin and gave you guys $500,000 check but wanted a 5% stake in the company, would you take it and what would you do with it if you did? Take the money, shut down the company, let's start a new company. Buy a red evil man.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:06:26.445 --> 0:06:28.656]: 
  Amazing!

 SPEAKER_07 [0:06:51.539 --> 0:06:53.007]: 
  Ryan...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:53.007 --> 0:06:57.360]: 
  It's like flipping houses.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:53.496 --> 0:06:53.732]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:54.441 --> 0:06:57.394]: 
  Can you make open houses?

 SPEAKER_05 [0:06:57.006 --> 0:07:10.962]: 
  Start a new patreon keep the old one running and just stack them up I'd like to think the real answer would be we'd probably do a couple animated series would actually make content It's gonna be like tiredhouse.com I think actually what I would do

 SPEAKER_06 [0:07:02.220 --> 0:07:03.402]: 
  Is that what you guys talking about?

 SPEAKER_06 [0:07:07.266 --> 0:07:07.334]: 
  MBC 뉴스 이덕영입니다.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:07:09.561 --> 0:07:18.353]: 
  I think actually what I would do is I would tell him a series of questions. Catch him off guard to see if he actually was truly a sleepy-cat with him.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:07:10.439 --> 0:07:12.936]: 
  What I would do is I would tell him a serious...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:12.936 --> 0:07:13.763]: 
  of questions.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:07:17.999 --> 0:07:22.622]: 
  Wait, what? No, who cares if he's a fan? He just gave you a $500,000

 SPEAKER_07 [0:07:22.622 --> 0:07:27.162]: 
  Well, if he knew about C.P. Cavanich, he's not a fan.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:07:26.790 --> 0:07:41.556]: 
  The other question is if are you gonna take it if somebody wants five percent? I know I would tell him. Everybody says yes. This is what I would say. I was gonna say Chris you can't spend on the money and you're resident evil. Yeah it's not fair. You can spend half of it. I would really want to make a character. You can build half of the mansion. I would really spend the amount of character. Yeah I think we would.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:07:30.267 --> 0:07:33.203]: 
  I know, I would tell him. I think everybody says, yeah, that's the story. This is what I would say.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:31.448 --> 0:07:32.005]: 
  Yes

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:33.203 --> 0:07:33.220]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:36.190 --> 0:07:37.101]: 
  Yeah, it's not fair.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:37.101 --> 0:07:39.852]: 
  I would really want to make her.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:07:39.852 --> 0:07:45.100]: 
  I would really I think I obviously think we probably do a couple series 500,000

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:43.986 --> 0:07:50.112]: 
  500,000 like a really arbitrary number like why would anybody really here's half a million and I want

 SPEAKER_05 [0:07:47.057 --> 0:07:48.627]: 
  Why would anybody believe here's?

 SPEAKER_05 [0:07:49.437 --> 0:07:53.706]: 
  And I wonder if that person is a creepy rich kid like he said he has a rich dad or something I would bring

 SPEAKER_06 [0:07:51.495 --> 0:07:52.390]: 
  like he's a rich man.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:07:52.390 --> 0:08:00.439]: 
  I would bring him into a dark room where light is shining on him and I would ask him does my dad fuck me And then start chopping off his fingers

 SPEAKER_05 [0:07:56.710 --> 0:08:04.742]: 
  Does my dad fuck me. And then start chopping off his fingers with pliers. If he didn't give me the answer, I would have. Maybe he did for the answer.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:00.439 --> 0:08:01.941]: 
  We're twins. We're fliers.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:08:01.941 --> 0:08:03.004]: 
  If you didn't give me the answer

 SPEAKER_04 [0:08:03.004 --> 0:08:08.117]: 
  Maybe he wanted one. I'd better capture cards and start let's playing and make triple that.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:08:09.197 --> 0:08:38.459]: 
  What day? You'd start so you're basically saying with $500,000 you'd start a Minecraft let's play challenge. Yes. Alright. Moving on. So you would keep all the money and then just start playing. And make more. There you go. That's right. Nathan Brown asks, not that Sleepy Cabin has been going for almost a year. How do you dashing guys feel about the growth and work of Sleepy Cabin? Has working together helped you guys grow as content producers? No.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:08:14.462 --> 0:08:15.188]:

  There you go, that's right.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:37.986 --> 0:08:41.952]: 
  No, no. No, truthfully working together has made me hate and resent people. It's cool.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:08:41.952 --> 0:08:45.479]: 
  I don't actually hate each other, we all hate each other, this is my idea.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:43.926 --> 0:08:43.943]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_05 [0:08:43.943 --> 0:08:43.960]:

  Like, we are friends.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:54.507 --> 0:08:57.713]: 
  Exactly how it is portrayed in the video

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:59.181 --> 0:09:01.307]: 
  Tomorrow we knock out.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:09:04.767 --> 0:09:12.765]: 
  Uh, what was the question? It was... basically has working together helped you guys grow as content producers? Really? No, because we've all been working together anyways.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:09:06.100 --> 0:09:06.944]: 
  It was...

 SPEAKER_07 [0:09:09.880 --> 0:09:10.740]: 
  really know because

 SPEAKER_07 [0:09:12.057 --> 0:09:15.668]: 
  Wait, what's a content creator? Oh my god, Cory.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:09:14.335 --> 0:09:16.832]: 
  Oh my god, Cory, I'm smelling your face.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:15.668 --> 0:09:19.499]: 
  This is the shit you've been doing for the last decade of your life, man.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:09:18.300 --> 0:09:18.503]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_06 [0:09:18.503 --> 0:09:18.689]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:09:19.499 --> 0:09:23.734]: 
  You make content you make things

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:20.444 --> 0:09:20.950]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_05 [0:09:20.950 --> 0:09:30.417]: 
  Make things even better. You know, it's what all these fucking worthless let's players call themselves who play video games. They create content. Yeah, you're a project creator. Oh, stuff. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:09:27.784 --> 0:09:28.493]: 
  Yeah, you're a pun-

 SPEAKER_07 [0:09:28.493 --> 0:09:30.484]: 
  Oh, stuff like that.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:09:30.417 --> 0:09:32.948]: 
  Stuff, literally just stuff, like shit you throw out a wall.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:09:32.948 --> 0:09:39.445]: 
  If you eat a sandwich on camera and put it on YouTube, you're gonna regret it. No, it really has no meanings with it.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:09:36.205 --> 0:09:37.504]: 
  It's content.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:09:37.504 --> 0:09:44.457]: 
  No, it really has no meaning to it. If anything, it's... I haven't made any. It has no validity to it. Here's what's ironic.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:09:39.445 --> 0:09:39.664]: 
  Peace out.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:09:41.149 --> 0:10:11.862]: 
  It has no validity. So I think here's what's ironic is that we've got Jeff and Corey who both have been working on a game with Tom Fulp We have Zach and Chris have both have been working on hellbenders We have now has been working on half of the ladies in Philadelphia and outside of the state Me who have also been working on some other stuff So while we have sleepy cabin we chose a time to start this when everybody was working at a table top huge other fucking project

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:49.013 --> 0:09:49.941]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:09:56.674 --> 0:09:58.176]: 
  and outside of the stage.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:01.281 --> 0:10:05.010]: 
  Stay ever in me who have also been working on some other stuff.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:10:09.229 --> 0:10:16.519]: 
  huge other fucking yeah it was basically like hey let's start a podcast while we're all super invested in all drowning and work now

 SPEAKER_05 [0:10:13.330 --> 0:10:13.752]: 
  not catch

 SPEAKER_05 [0:10:15.017 --> 0:10:41.494]: 
  We're all drowning in work. Next, we got Jace Baker. He says, we sent him shit today. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yesterday. We sent a lot of people shit today and yesterday. You're having your biography written, which fellow sleepy cabin member or Jeff, would you want to write it? Would you want to write it? So, um. I'm going to stamp it right. Shot down again. Yeah, OK. Wait, you would write stampers? So he would let stamp right here. Oh, you would let stamp right here?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:31.791 --> 0:10:32.770]: 
  I don't want you to write it.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:10:35.740 --> 0:10:37.410]: 
  Let's stamper, right? Shot down again.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:10:40.313 --> 0:10:44.498]: 
  Oh, you would let Stamp write yours? Correct, yes.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:21:28.465 --> 0:23:44.055]: 
  Okay, I woke up. I went to the post office. I had a package to send to my mom on my way to The post office a guy stopped me in the street and said hey Did you hear the towers got hit and I literally did not process it and just thought the guy was crazy It's New York. You never know and I was like yeah, yeah, okay, whatever I went to post office. I sent my package No one at the post office seemed to have any kind of reaction at all and now my way back There were there was some people that I don't know I guess it's kind of like you know things felt a little weird But like I didn't really really anticipate anything. I got to Pretty much to our building and there was a bunch of people standing outside they were on their phones and everybody was trying to make phone calls and I asked what was going on and they said that the Twin Towers got hit and I said what what I mean I guess like when they say you're just like what does that mean like hit? Yeah, what do you mean? Yeah, and then some yeah, I got hit by hacker. Yeah, or something and then somebody said no a plane flew into it I was like, oh shit. That's fucking crazy And they're like yeah, you can see it from the roof and I was like oh shit So I was like okay at that point it was just like oh the tower Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I went up and I was living with two film guys Adrian and Adrian Elsie and Ben Baker and they're both Guys and I went upstairs and Ben was smoking Adrian wasn't there he did whatever he wanted Ben was a big pothead back then you still may be Ben Baker Lee Anyways, I woke him up and I said hey dude I heard the towers got hit and you can see it from the roof which you go up and He's like what are you talking about anyways? He woke up and he brought his camera up and we went up and all the people in our building which we very rarely saw It was a converted warehouse textile work textile factory, which was then turned into a bunch of lofts 248 McKibbin Street Anyone in New York who knows that it's there anyways It's off the Montrose stop and we went up to the roof and there was just everybody everybody was up on the The roof of the building and they all had their phones out and everyone was trying to make phone calls No, we can get through to anything But what was really creepy is that you're across the river so you can actually look across into Manhattan You could just see like one of the towers and just like smoke coming out of it

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:58.485 --> 0:21:58.502]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:58.502 --> 0:21:58.688]: 
  Great.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:23.494 --> 0:22:27.612]: 
  hit like yeah what do you mean yeah and then so yeah I got hit by hackers yeah or something and then

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:37.129 --> 0:22:39.576]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I went up.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:37.939 --> 0:22:38.496]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:45.449 --> 0:22:45.854]: 
  Nice.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:23:44.646 --> 0:23:54.467]: 
  It was pretty creepy iconic image. Yeah, well it was one of the iconic images It was both of them were still standing at the time. Yeah, and only what was at this point of a correct. Yeah Yeah, you know you

 SPEAKER_06 [0:23:53.151 --> 0:23:55.986]: 
  Yeah, yeah, only one was it. Oh, you got there before the second one was it?

 SPEAKER_05 [0:23:55.716 --> 0:24:22.919]: 
  Yeah, so everyone it said the first one hit and then by that time I got home and went upstairs and we saw it and then While we were up there somebody brought up a television because none of our shit was fucking working No one can make phone calls and all the lines were like I believe this is what I believe I was telling Stanford this earlier was that the cellular tower was on top of The Twin Towers I believe that was the case

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:10.785 --> 0:24:12.321]: 
  All the lines were like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:10.819 --> 0:24:11.005]: 
  All right.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:24:21.923 --> 0:24:24.505]: 
  This was 2001 where people still had people

 SPEAKER_05 [0:24:24.505 --> 0:24:47.168]: 
  itself is but wasn't like a huge thing a lot of people had him at that point yeah a lot of people had him at that point but it wasn't as excessive we all had that flip shit there was no like smart like it's not yeah so but anyways we were up there and no one can make phone calls and one of the towers was hit Ben brought up his camera and someone brought up a television and then tenant television

 SPEAKER_06 [0:24:31.964 --> 0:24:35.693]: 
  There was no like smart phones.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:24:47.944 --> 0:26:20.419]: 
  and they had the local news going on. Which is interesting because like pixel for pixel, what you saw on the horizon versus what you saw, yeah, on the actual television was pretty much relative. And then the second one, well, basically everything after the first one hit. So we saw the first hour go down, we also saw the second one hit. And when all that was happening, I just remember everyone trying to call people. And Stepra and I were actually talking about like post-apocalyptic movies where like, how do people feel like the world was ending? And we always see like, you know, people hanging from a lamppost or people shooting themselves or whatever. But the truth is the way it really fucking hits you is when you're self-treated. You try to fucking call someone. Yeah, when you try to call someone or your internet isn't working. And they're not your phone. Because like all of a sudden you can't contact anybody. You feel isolated. So fucking isolated. Like here I was with like six people. Even with a phone. Nobody remembers phone numbers anymore. Oh yeah, even if you had the phone, you couldn't call anybody. But it's like here you are trying to call like your parents or whatever to let them know you're all right or whatever. And like you don't have cell service. You don't have internet. You don't have any of this fucking shit. There's no better way to make people feel isolated than take away that. Because it's weird because it takes down your communication from the world down to a block. And you're so used to it. Down to the top of a block. You can't tweet it. You can't Facebook it. You can't call somebody. You can't text somebody. You're literally just like, who's next to me? If you ask, you'd be like,

 SPEAKER_07 [0:24:55.521 --> 0:24:55.791]: 
  what you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:30.689 --> 0:25:32.444]: 
  You've all got a fucking call sign.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:25:32.494 --> 0:25:32.967]: 
  Oh, when you try to...

 SPEAKER_06 [0:25:34.435 --> 0:25:35.447]: 
  They're not your f-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:40.442 --> 0:25:41.995]: 
  RISELATED zug

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:41.168 --> 0:25:43.480]: 
  So fucking isolated like here

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:44.324 --> 0:25:48.694]: 
  Even with a paid phone, nobody remembers phone numbers anymore. Oh yeah, even if you have a phone number.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:50.432 --> 0:25:50.888]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:55.495 --> 0:25:56.018]: 
  And

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:56.018 --> 0:25:56.659]: 
  like you don't have

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:09.940 --> 0:26:11.762]: 
  And you're so used to it. You can't...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:15.492 --> 0:26:16.943]: 
  Little bit.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:16.943 --> 0:26:17.415]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:18.850 --> 0:26:23.001]: 
  If you asked it, would you be like, the second tower just went down LOL? Yes!

 SPEAKER_05 [0:26:23.001 --> 0:26:43.943]: 
  No, you'd probably take a photo and put it on Instagram at a filter or something. You're fucking saying that you're like a movie star. Oh yeah, no, that worked. I have to ask this because I'm genuinely curious. I remember specifically at that time, the initial news was like, if you listen to the radio broadcast or how it started to fucking anybody who was seeing that or whatever,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:26.325 --> 0:26:28.992]: 
  Or something. And then you're like, oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:27.574 --> 0:26:29.751]: 
  Oh yeah, no that worked.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:26:43.943 --> 0:26:49.107]: 
  was going on at that point. Initially everybody thought it was an accident.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:26:49.107 --> 0:27:00.042]: 
  What point did it dot on you when the second tower got hit everyone? I think everybody knew and not only that but we had like I said we had the TV up there Yeah, and once the second tower hit

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:59.451 --> 0:27:02.674]: 
  People would immediately, I mean how, how media was it before you would, um

 SPEAKER_05 [0:27:02.219 --> 0:27:59.003]: 
  Um, it was it was fairly clear, but it wasn't exactly Crystallized until peg on yeah So what happened was is that we were looking at a screen that had the twin towers hit and then all of a sudden the Screen on the newest went split screen and they showed the Pentagon as soon as we saw the Pentagon with a plane hitting the side of it Everybody on the roof was like yeah, fuck Half the roof cleared out and ran down and got water It's it was like as soon as that fucking happened there was no fucking question and at that point I actually started I have a tape somewhere in my boxes It's called black Tuesday and it's just a cassette tape where I just popped it into one of our Stereos and of course record as the news was playing it was just was you reacting to it? No, not me at all Oh, you were you record I just recorded like radio stations Okay, so it was like your favorite rock band radio station press record during 9-11 in New York And it was like all of these guys. You know that was a fuck up

 SPEAKER_07 [0:27:23.920 --> 0:27:25.219]: 
  Ja!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:45.081 --> 0:27:46.245]: 
  No, not me at all.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:56.927 --> 0:28:14.309]: 
  Dude, no, that was exactly what everything was. Everything was dedicated to it. Oh, I didn't know that. I remember, I was sleeping on the couch and my dad called me and he said, turn on the TV. I said, okay, what station? He said, it doesn't matter. And I was like, oh my god. Even in our lives.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:00.336 --> 0:28:01.872]: 
  Everything was dedicated to it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:08.588 --> 0:28:08.993]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:28:11.507 --> 0:28:39.942]: 
  And I was like, oh my god. I've heard that story several times. My mom, same thing, my aunt called her and said, Terry, what's it, it doesn't matter. It was everywhere. Even he was also in the country. When somebody says it doesn't matter, then you get no wake up. Yeah, like I lived in Ireland, in Gauley, in Ireland, some remote area. And my mom was like, I remember it happened. My mom kept like, she was on the phone, and she's like, is it the end of the world? Is it the end of the world? This is fucking hard. And you're on Ireland. My parents bought a bunch of things.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:28:22.189 --> 0:28:22.290]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:22.290 --> 0:28:27.505]: 
  Yeah, when somebody says it doesn't matter, then you wake up.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:28:36.533 --> 0:28:38.625]: 
  This is fucking annoying YouTube

 SPEAKER_07 [0:28:38.625 --> 0:28:42.743]: 
  My parents bought a bunch of fucking pot noodles because we'd have to hide them on the ground.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:28:41.106 --> 0:28:45.949]: 
  We have to hide them Context using Ireland to your parents but pot

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:45.949 --> 0:28:52.952]: 
  For you to hide underground in Ireland. Yep because of what was happening at the water. I thought they were buying them to send us.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:28:49.476 --> 0:28:50.995]: 
  Because the water's happening at water.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:50.995 --> 0:28:52.463]: 
  They're not buying them to send them.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:28:52.463 --> 0:28:54.437]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:28:54.134 --> 0:28:59.517]:

  4-3 the next day.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:28:55.450 --> 0:29:10.705]:

I remember watching it with, I was at my friend's house and he had three kids and they were like 12, 10 and eight. And I was like, go into the fucking living room and just watch a movie. And they put on Robocop. And I didn't even think anything, cause I was trying to work. And they all watched Robocop. And they thought that it was a fucking amazing movie. They loved it. Their mom came home and fucking chewed me out and shit because dudes are getting blown apart. But what was weird about that was, I watched Robocop really late in life. I never really saw it as a kid. I saw a couple of pieces of it. But when I was older, I watched it for the first time and it made me sick. I was like, Jesus Christ. This movie is brutal. That's one thing my parents, they let me watch. It was a weird split difference where like, I'd watched tons of rated R movies, but then I finally watched Robocop later.

  Yeah, no, I agree. I just have from Real Bad ADD, and like ever since I moved to America, I haven't been on meds or anything, and it's been really hard for me to actually focus on anything, like and it's really tough because like, you know, I'm living with these guys who are really, really, really, really,

 SPEAKER_05 [0:41:53.438 --> 0:41:59.952]: 
  really creative and shit and I can't like actually just like focus on one thing and you know you know I could help you guys

  I had no idea. Yeah, you did. No, I didn't. Oh, really? I had no idea this was the thing. Oh, no, this is a real thing. No. And so, like, I'm not sure what it is.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:42:03.951 --> 0:42:05.436]: 
  No, I didn't. Oh, really?

 SPEAKER_05 [0:42:09.992 --> 0:42:15.949]: 
  It's really hard for me to actually get motivation and stuff because I just can't think of like one thing for more than five seconds

 SPEAKER_04 [0:42:15.291 --> 0:42:17.063]: 
  A lot of people have this problem.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:16.304 --> 0:42:30.040]: 
  That's the thing you can't beat yourself up ever but I feel like everybody has problems Especially when it comes to creative shit Yeah, so you can't like everybody feels bad about everything they do and it's always like this

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:24.437 --> 0:42:24.876]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:42:28.926 --> 0:42:32.993]: 
  I'll say this too, maybe if you're like, you know, everyone has

 SPEAKER_05 [0:42:31.947 --> 0:42:35.558]: 
  Everyone has a weak spot with creativity, so maybe you're really good at creating

 SPEAKER_06 [0:42:35.440 --> 0:42:48.079]: 
  Oh, that's true. Yeah, maybe you see what good thinking about this, but maybe you're not gonna execute that so that's so true It's so everyone has a soft spot. So maybe you see people who you see all of us who seem like really Creative and funny we all have

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:35.558 --> 0:42:36.132]: 
  Oh, that's true.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:39.625 --> 0:42:39.945]: 
  So good.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:39.945 --> 0:42:40.755]: 
  That's so true.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:42:46.240 --> 0:43:01.005]: 
  Creative and fun we all have weak spots whether it's like timing or like hitting stuff out on time Yeah getting stuff done or doing that product or whatever if you feel stressed out It's it's easy to get burnt out if you feel stressed out of world actually step away not weak or whatever You're gonna be weak if you find out

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:53.007 --> 0:42:53.867]: 
  I'll try to hit to another one.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:43:00.111 --> 0:43:03.621]: 
  You're gonna be weak if you fucking burn yourself out. You can't work for two weeks.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:03.554 --> 0:43:25.947]: 
  I'll say this, if you're sitting at home beating yourself up every day because you feel like you're not a good voice actor, day after day, then maybe you shouldn't be a voice actor, maybe you could keep doing it, but maybe you were meant for something else. Yeah, explore older years. It's not to say that, why pigeonhole yourself, there's no reason to pigeonhole yourself into a specific career. The world has changed and the world constantly changed.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:43:16.834 --> 0:43:17.948]: 
  Explore all of us.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:43:25.947 --> 0:43:39.362]: 
  By the way, the world is it's it's certainly now is the time where you can't change it allows you to yeah None of us none of us are single singularly voice actors or singularly I mean Jeff really your voice actor games on an animated calling your fucking it is weird Oh, yeah

 SPEAKER_05 [0:43:31.364 --> 0:43:31.802]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:37.995 --> 0:43:45.944]: 
  It is weird. You don't have to point at a star and say, I'm going to be a web designer for the rest of my life and lock yourself into this. That's the end of the window.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:43:44.492 --> 0:43:48.070]: 
  That's the same as we know. This is kind of on topic, but...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:45.944 --> 0:43:46.230]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:43:46.230 --> 0:43:46.500]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_04 [0:43:46.500 --> 0:43:52.947]: 
  This is kind of on topic, but when you get to a certain age, you sort of realize there's certain professions. It's just impossible

 SPEAKER_05 [0:43:52.947 --> 0:44:10.007]: 
  Possible like I can't be a police officer now. I can't fly fighter jets now just saying you cuz I think Jeff like Yeah, I really can see I got that really when I found out there was like 12 year old golfers that were getting better scores than Tiger Woods And I was like wow I think it's all I don't see ever

 SPEAKER_06 [0:43:58.701 --> 0:44:00.996]: 
  You close. I think Jeff, like you close. I probably can't.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:00.996 --> 0:44:02.498]: 
  I got that feeling when I fell.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:44:08.657 --> 0:44:08.742]: 
  MBC 뉴스 이덕영입니다.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:08.742 --> 0:44:19.947]: 
  I think it's all good. You can definitely be a police officer because most of them are douchebags and it's pretty easy to get them right. You'd be the most in shape police officer there is. Because your eyesight is bad.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:44:10.007 --> 0:44:11.256]: 
  Never be a police officer.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:44:13.500 --> 0:44:18.951]: 
  It's pretty easy to get a stand right. You'd be the most in shape without further ado.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:44:18.816 --> 0:44:26.680]: 
  My eyesight is bad. Yeah, my eyesight stinks, but I'm just saying things people get into in the early 20s and train hard and you're just like, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:26.680 --> 0:44:31.675]: 
  You sort of crossed that bridge you're just like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:29.667 --> 0:44:39.944]: 
  But this is the transitional generational period where you don't have to train hard for one specific walk of life You just got to break your ass

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:33.244 --> 0:44:33.869]: 
  You don't have to.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:44:33.497 --> 0:44:33.835]: 
  Don't have to.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:44:34.645 --> 0:44:34.949]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:44:36.872 --> 0:44:46.255]: 
  I'm just saying. Yeah, you just gotta break your ass for all of us. Some people still do it instead when they're still coming to you. You're funny and creative. You can do any number of things. That also opens up the other.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:44:39.944 --> 0:44:40.230]: 
  So do you.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:44:42.019 --> 0:44:42.998]: 
  You're funny and crazy.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:44.770 --> 0:44:49.950]: 
  That also opens up the other door where people think they are. Yeah, it's not working out very well.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:44:48.195 --> 0:45:03.636]: 
  Yeah, it is not working out very well. With too much confidence out there that are worthless. You know what? And there's people with too much confidence to actually get really successful based on them just being confident. If you're motivated and confident, you'll need talent. Yeah, no, that's actually correct.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:52.195 --> 0:44:53.005]: 
  You know what?

 SPEAKER_06 [0:44:53.005 --> 0:44:53.984]: 
  people want too much.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:57.983 --> 0:44:59.198]: 
  Be confident.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:45:01.729 --> 0:45:05.948]: 
  Yeah, no, that's actually correct, but Jeff like the thing with me is that I

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:05.948 --> 0:45:06.944]:

  You do it on the same way.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:13.575 --> 0:45:19.448]: 
  I would rather not have a job than just not work in any of those things.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:45:17.119 --> 0:45:20.680]: 
  Like, we're all like in any of those times. We're all like us.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:32.879 --> 0:47:35.207]: 
  What was your definition of a cringey video?

 SPEAKER_06 [0:47:35.207 --> 0:47:39.105]: 
  Just a video where it's like really hard to watch, you need to pause it halfway through to be like

  That's the way through to be like, oh my god. That's it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:51.492 --> 0:47:56.250]: 
  Yeah, the rest of the brain... So why did you embrace the suffering of other human beings?

 SPEAKER_06 [0:47:56.183 --> 0:47:59.254]: 
  At the time no one else did that and, um... It's not all of them. People suffering.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:47:57.449 --> 0:48:07.995]: 
  And people suffering. People uploading videos of their own. Like a lot of people just made videos of themselves. They made asses of themselves. It was their choice to upload.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:48:05.869 --> 0:48:10.206]: 
  It was there too, I stopped loading. However, I do feel about a bad boat.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:07.995 --> 0:48:15.437]:

 SPEAKER_05 [0:50:02.999 --> 0:50:17.444]: 
  I wish with Joe people point you disease. He's like kind of nervous like laughing cuz this guy's a fucking like camcorder So who's filming it himself? So how do you know what he looks like if he's That is doubly cringy but the reason

 SPEAKER_06 [0:50:08.550 --> 0:50:11.149]: 
  himself this guy this guy is such a how do you

 SPEAKER_06 [0:50:12.077 --> 0:50:24.059]: 
  He turns to himself. He turns to the camera also. Wow, that is doubly cringy. But the reason he recorded this is because he thought he was picking up the woman. And by the way, at the very end, he likes to have a wife. He's like, oh yeah, this would be a good place for my wife and I.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:50:24.059 --> 0:50:28.682]: 
  at the very end he's like i don't have a wife, she's like oh, okay, let's uh...

 SPEAKER_06 [0:50:28.682 --> 0:50:36.175]: 
  He gets super busy and comfortable. I had to pause it probably 30 times. I couldn't watch all of it. I actually originally found that video. That's why it's like.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:50:33.660 --> 0:50:34.217]: 
  I actually

 SPEAKER_05 [0:50:35.247 --> 0:50:39.432]: 
  That's probably the worst one look try looking up. I don't know what it's called. Oh, it's kind of shocking. Why do you?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:37.997 --> 0:50:40.410]: 
  Swiss kind of shock. Why do you go out of your way to...

 SPEAKER_05 [0:50:40.410 --> 0:50:46.266]: 
  watch it you I think a lot of it is to do it with relatability yeah you feel like you're that guy as well yeah like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:43.583 --> 0:50:44.612]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:50:45.574 --> 0:50:46.992]: 
  Yeah, like there's videos where I

 SPEAKER_05 [0:50:46.992 --> 0:51:00.002]: 
  I'd be watching it like where a kid would have blowed himself to like YouTube it when he's yeah, he'll make a complete ass of himself It was a the spider. Yeah, you can sit there and be I'd looked like that kid I could have been that kid. See I had the internet years before

 SPEAKER_07 [0:50:50.249 --> 0:50:50.957]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:52.459 --> 0:50:52.493]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_06 [0:50:52.493 --> 0:50:54.805]: 
  Okay, we'll say the eye of the spider is like...

 SPEAKER_06 [0:50:57.944 --> 0:51:02.534]: 
  I had the internet years before no that is such horses. It's not horse. It's people

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:00.002 --> 0:51:07.950]: 
  That is such horseshit. It's not horseshit. People watch cringe videos to say look at what that asshole did. I'm so much better than he is. Yeah, that's like definitely a lot of people.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:51:06.398 --> 0:51:08.946]: 
  Well, yeah, that's like definitely a lot of it.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:51:07.950 --> 0:51:27.998]: 
  of it but I'm saying but but he's saying it's the I dodge that bullet yeah there's a lot of seriously I could have easily have so many things easily could have been me comedy bombing videos are funny because they're come the comedians are usually assholes and they deserve it and you're like yeah you watch them implode a lot of those a lot of those videos satisfying because they're making asses of the self I want to wipe this

 SPEAKER_06 [0:51:14.144 --> 0:51:17.046]: 
  There's so many things that could have been made.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:22.193 --> 0:51:24.690]: 
  You watch them implode? A lot of those videos.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:23.644 --> 0:51:23.779]: 
  I'll be right back.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:27.998 --> 0:51:36.621]: 
  screen of that man. What? It's hard, yeah, it's just really hard. I guess that's the cringe part. It's hard for me to watch. Yeah, but what's the point of it? A lot of the time, it's hard.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:51:34.545 --> 0:51:42.949]: 
  No, what's up? I'm out of time. I'll say this too, like, cringe is like an evolved treat for sympathy. Yeah. No, it is. It is the ultimate, absolutely.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:51:39.794 --> 0:51:40.452]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:40.452 --> 0:51:40.958]: 
  It is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:42.949 --> 0:51:48.940]: 
  That is the biggest crock of shit. No! The reason why you sympathy are you kidding me?

 SPEAKER_05 [0:51:44.822 --> 0:51:56.449]: 
  No, the reason why you sympathize with me is because you were sympathizing with that. That doesn't do with the fact that you want to watch it. I actually agree with that. I agree with that.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:51:44.940 --> 0:51:45.447]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:51:50.830 --> 0:51:52.905]: 
  That's all it is.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:51:55.521 --> 0:52:29.440]: 
  No, I will say listen, this is 100% serious I feel like the time where I cannot watch something is when someone else is really uncomfortable in the position Like this if some fucking creepy autistic is bothering someone who clearly isn't interested That makes me uncomfortable. Yeah, because that person's like get the fuck away from me But he's this idiot doesn't see any social cues. You guys have no problem watching these videos while I'm standing I don't mind seeing an autistic in tone on himself But I do mind when said autistic is imploding on someone who doesn't want to see it

 SPEAKER_04 [0:51:56.449 --> 0:51:56.972]: 
  No, I'm

 SPEAKER_04 [0:51:58.322 --> 0:51:59.487]: 
  I can't argue with it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:15.552 --> 0:52:16.345]: 
  It doesn't stand a chance.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:19.382 --> 0:52:19.416]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:27.803 --> 0:52:28.444]: 
  I don't know.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:52:28.444 --> 0:52:29.001]: 
  I know what you're talking about.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:29.001 --> 0:52:30.655]: 
  Look, this is another fact.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:52:29.119 --> 0:52:35.599]: 
  Look, this is another factor. He's saying he doesn't mind the video wars. He's like, like, Christiana Lodin's or something. He's saying the video is where...

 SPEAKER_06 [0:52:30.655 --> 0:52:31.026]: 
  He's here.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:52:33.675 --> 0:52:38.029]: 
  He's saying the videos were it's like Donald's exclusive

 SPEAKER_07 [0:52:36.342 --> 0:52:48.441]: 
  Yeah, if someone like creepy like someone like with like toys and stuff What I was like, I really think you're pretty and want to give this to you and the person's like get the fuck away Yeah, that makes me comfortable. Another thing is I don't laugh at that That's the first thing

 SPEAKER_04 [0:52:38.029 --> 0:52:38.080]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:43.919 --> 0:52:44.003]: 
  We

 SPEAKER_05 [0:52:44.003 --> 0:53:03.494]: 
  Yeah, that makes me uncomfortable. I know what I'm saying, but that's the first time you watch like Chris Chen. That is the first, like you'll cringe the first time, right? But he's by himself. No, I know, right? But you'll cringe the first time, but then you'll watch the next thing it blows, because it blows like 500 videos, right? So you'll cringe for every video, because it's always new. But you'll be in trance. But then the next time you watch it, you've already seen it, so you don't cringe anymore.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:52:52.002 --> 0:52:52.221]: 
  right

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:59.595 --> 0:53:01.789]: 
  But you'll be in trance. But then the next thing you watch,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:03.494 --> 0:53:05.991]: 
  You're a fan, so you kind of just watch it to watch it.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:53:04.506 --> 0:53:06.447]: 
  watching

 SPEAKER_04 [0:53:05.991 --> 0:53:08.522]: 
  and transcends this to me. I don't know why, but he's a son of a bitch.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:53:08.067 --> 0:53:14.935]: 
  He's the same, you guilty of that too. He's crudged too. I'm not a fan of this stuff, but Chris Cheney is probably the one. The white who feels what's Chris Cheney is whatever else feels what's either a psycho.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:53:10.362 --> 0:53:11.880]: 
  I'm not a fan of this stuff.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:53:11.880 --> 0:53:12.049]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:12.049 --> 0:53:14.007]: 
  You and your meld would've run for it

 SPEAKER_07 [0:53:14.007 --> 0:53:18.242]: 
  It's the same feeling that satisfaction you get.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:53:15.542 --> 0:53:21.854]: 
  It's the same feeling that satisfaction you get from Christians, what do people feel, and it's deads further.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:20.706 --> 0:53:26.325]: 
  I think cringe is one of those definitions that's so up in the air. Speaking of cringe, Jesus Christ, shut the fuck up!

 SPEAKER_05 [0:53:23.625 --> 0:53:29.937]: 
  Speaking of cringe, Jesus Christ, shut the fuck up. Let's get to our next question. Can I get our cringy ass?

 SPEAKER_06 [0:53:26.984 --> 0:53:38.003]: 
  Can I get through my cringy ass? Yeah. We didn't answer it. We didn't even answer it. Can I bookend this by saying I do think that some videos go super overboard and do good? Yeah, totally. What are you doing? Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:29.937 --> 0:53:31.506]: 
  We didn't even answer

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53 --> 0:53:31.439]: 
  answer

 SPEAKER_05 [0:53:35.033 --> 0:53:42.323]: 
  Yeah, totally. What are you doing? Yes. This is my drink. That's my drink. Wait, sorry. That was your last statement? No, no, no, sorry, sorry, sorry.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:53:38.003 --> 0:53:39.505]: 
  Like that, wait, sorry that was-

 SPEAKER_06 [0:53:39.505 --> 0:53]: 
  I was here with your last statement Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry Chris Chit on one of you Chris here the other one you have people who like kill yourself comics or some fat guy who's just doing movie reviews or something There's a huge great bulletin

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:50.744 --> 0:53:51.705]: 
  Yeah, yeah

 SPEAKER_07 [0:53:52.735 --> 0:54:07.754]: 
  Yeah, I don't mind seeing someone... Okay, here's another example. One last example, but I don't mind if somebody's clearly trying. If you see someone who's put their heart into everything and if it's a little cringy, you can still look past it because at least in their eyes they're actually like... Like, Christian tries. He really tries.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:54:06.184 --> 0:54:10.217]: 
  Like, Christian tries. He really means what he's doing. Another thing about Christian is that it's such a...

 SPEAKER_05 [0:54:07.754 --> 0:54:08.024]: 
  this

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:09.424 --> 0:54:15.752]: 
  That is such horseshit. You know you take that video link it to all your friends That's not true at all

 SPEAKER_04 [0:54:13.238 --> 0:54:24.578]: 
  No, that's not true at all. Yes, it is No, another thing there's a gray area between somebody who is clearly out of their fucking mind and somebody who is actually

 SPEAKER_06 [0:54:15.989 --> 0:54:19.127]: 
  Yes it is! Another thing is...

 SPEAKER_06 [0:54:24.578 --> 0:54:29.033]: 
  Cory, how do you even know who's out of their fucking minds? Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:54:27.987 --> 0:54:32.003]: 
  You're kidding me? I fucking harbor the concept of autism.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:54:32.003 --> 0:54:38.449]: 
  I've been lying for four fucking years. You think I can't tell the difference between a autistic who's imploded in himself?

 SPEAKER_05 [0:54:38.449 --> 0:54:39.006]: 
  See her!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:39.006 --> 0:54:45.503]: 
  That is exactly what I'm talking about.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:54:42.735 --> 0:54:48.675]: 
  amazing no but you guys are forgetting the Christian really mean are you proved yourself you

 SPEAKER_05 [0:54:45.503 --> 0:54:56.978]: 
  I'm getting the Christian's really mean. You guys are forgetting that he's like the core. That is the most poetic way of saying where you stand by the way. Christian is racist homophobic.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:54:50.042 --> 0:54:54.497]: 
  That is the most poetic way of saying where you stand by the way, Corey.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:54:55.155 --> 0:54:59.492]: 
  He deserves it, he's a great homophobic. A fucking douchebag? No, no, no, wait, wait, okay, one human...

 SPEAKER_05 [0:54:57.602 --> 0:55:05.449]: 
  Sp teaspoon

 SPEAKER_06 [0:54:57.990 --> 0:55:00.606]: 
  We'll know the other way. Okay, one he was raised badly.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:55:01.652 --> 0:55:24.940]: 
  Nobody picks up. We're not cheating. It's interesting. Step or step or step or step. Okay. Hold on. You guys haven't been obsessing on room fucking. Step or step. Hold on. Let me say something about this. If you want a store, if you want a store, you're a social place store. You don't think what you guys have been doing for years is picking up something. I will admit. How are you picking up? Jeff. Anyone, please. Step or step. I will admit.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:05.449 --> 0:55:09.499]: 
  We're still okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. You guys haven't been obsessing on

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:09.499 --> 0:55:13.617]: 
  I'm fucking licking these things. Let me say something about this shit.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:55:15.085 --> 0:55:18.443]: 
  You don't think what you guys have been doing for years is picking up

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:18.443 --> 0:55:18.780]: 
  I will!

 SPEAKER_07 [0:55:18.780 --> 0:55:19.928]: 
  One bit, how are you?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:19.928 --> 0:55:20.704]: 
  P.J. P.J.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:55:22.695 --> 0:55:27.437]: 
  I will admit that I did pick on him

 SPEAKER_04 [0:55:27.437 --> 0:55:37.208]: 
  back then and I do feel remorse for what I've done but I will also admit that now seeing the air of my ways I can also appreciate the fact

 SPEAKER_07 [0:55:35.993 --> 0:55:42.945]: 
  I also appreciate the fact that he's made charming content. Corey, actually, Steve, can I take this point?

 SPEAKER_06 [0:55:39.435 --> 0:56:11.565]: 
  Corrie, actually nice varsity jacket you got on. Can I make this point? Get on here like he's fucking nervous. Stop, stop! I'll give you a hook. Shut up! If you were to fucking... Nice varsity jacket, Zach. If you were at the show... Nice varsity jacket, Chris. What? If you were at McDonald's, if you were at McDonald's, you saw somebody screaming, you're going, do I ordered pickles on my hamburger? You motherfucker! You'd sit there and watch, and you'd laugh at him. You know what you would say? I would not. I would turn off immediately. No, no, if you actually had to... Why would I......sauce it in person. Oh, I'd walk out. In person. You would fucking sit there and watch. No, seriously. I think there's a difference. No, no, no. By the way, by the way.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:42.945 --> 0:55:43.941]: 
  Stop, stop!

 SPEAKER_05 [0:55:43.941 --> 0:55:43.958]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:49.493 --> 0:55:49.814]: 
  Of course.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:55.990 --> 0:55:56.935]: 
  Not my hamburger!

 SPEAKER_04 [0:55:58.774 --> 0:56:01.930]: 
  I would turn off immediately.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:56:04.309 --> 0:56:04.495]: 
  Oh

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:04.495 --> 0:56:05.372]: 
  You gotta walk out.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:06.520 --> 0:56:18.434]: 
  You and Jeff Woodwalk are... No seriously! I think there's a difference. No no no! By the way, by the way! No jokes aside, judging my character, how long you've known me, you think I would sit in McDonald's and laugh at somebody like that? Just watch it, you'd be like, you'd at least sit there!

 SPEAKER_06 [0:56:16.324 --> 0:56:22.602]: 
  Just watch it, you'd be like, you'd at least sit there in interest. You would. In interest, in interest. You fucking wouldn't, you know it, would you?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:22.602 --> 0:56:24.002]: 
  I wouldn't watch it for entertainment.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:56:24.002 --> 0:56:27.006]: 
  I would be really upset.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:56:27.006 --> 0:56:33.942]: 
  I would farted really loud and laugh. I would- You would notice. I'll be really uncomfortable. He does that every day! And I'd be- I'd be- No!

 SPEAKER_06 [0:56:31.664 --> 0:56:38.397]: 
  He does that every day! I'm still hoping that he might have a baby. What are you waiting for?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:56:33.942 --> 0:56:36.507]: 
  I'm hoping it is. What are you insulting me for?

 SPEAKER_05 [0:56:36.507 --> 0:56:51.525]: 
  I'm not gonna be there. Like I said about humor, that humor, all it is is something new. So when you see something new like a guy walking into McDonald's and puking all over himself and falling the puke and doing like a snow angel, that would make you laugh because it's new and you've never seen it before. It's interesting, it's captivating. No, the theory behind you is...

 SPEAKER_06 [0:56:48.015 --> 0:56:49.804]: 
  It's interesting, it's captivating.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:49.804 --> 0:56:59.946]: 
  No, the theory behind Yoruba is something that you haven't seen before. That's what I'm saying! I've seen a lot of that, you've never seen a crazy person before, you see you are all fucking BOOTING DUDE UTHERS!

 SPEAKER_06 [0:56:59.946 --> 0:57:04.536]: 
  And every time you see something like this, you're not too Italian.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:57:01.431 --> 0:57:02.005]: 
  I've never seen you.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:57:02.005 --> 0:57:08.012]: 
  the man worst on it to the value. Listen, that's true. You are right.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:06.494 --> 0:57:06.679]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:57:06.679 --> 0:57:25.950]:

 SPEAKER_05 [0:58:56.502 --> 0:59:37.289]: 
  I'll say with what you said, I met people, at least talk people who say butthurt in real life, every time I hear someone say butthurt, over voice I cringe, I actually physically recoil. I hate the term butthurt and epic. It's weird talking to you. It's because I feel both of those words are used as like single word responses to just being a fucking asshole. It's like the perfect way, like if you were to voice your opinion about something, okay, this is how I feel, I just want to be honest blah blah blah, and they just write butthurt. It's just like one of those ways of just being like, I'm gonna find the perfect way to just be the most condescending little shit fuck to drop that little seed right in there. It's just, it's just, it's all kids man. No I get it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:02.965 --> 0:59:05.007]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:25:53.835 --> 1:25:55.506]: 
  even enough of it. Keep going.

 SPEAKER_06 [1:25:55.202 --> 1:25:59.067]: 
 你們都是私信書發言LAUGHGuntainUYoP

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:02.560 --> 1:26:04.332]: 
  Oh, right will she?

 SPEAKER_04 [1:26:07.589 --> 1:26:08.753]: 
  I do it in a way that I would.

 SPEAKER_07 [1:26:09.563 --> 1:26:30.859]: 
  I've watched today I watched a three-hour 100% run of a Mario Sunshine today, and you've already done that Yeah, I played Mario Sunshine. I know where everything is I want to see like some insane individual map out exactly how you beat the game at the fastest time on Another note stamper if I see Jeff have you?

 SPEAKER_05 [1:26:17.950 --> 1:26:20.025]: 
  But you don't know where everything is.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:26:27.197 --> 1:26:36.310]: 
  On another note, Stamper and Jeff, have you guys ever just watched guys play like a Street Fighter game? And just to watch how they play? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:35.905 --> 1:26:38.520]: 
  Yeah, sure. I'm watching Nevo right now.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:26:38.757 --> 1:26:44.984]: 
  And there's nothing weird about that. No! There's nothing to str- I'm watching... Well, it's a difference between watching-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:39.904 --> 1:26:40.748]: 
  No!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:43.482 --> 1:26:49.405]: 
  There's a difference between watching a game for five minutes versus watching something for four hours

 SPEAKER_05 [1:26:49.405 --> 1:26:55.092]: 
  A four hour watch is a game walkthrough. A chess match. Alright, I know where this is going.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:51.497 --> 1:26:52.375]: 
  It's like watching a-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:54.923 --> 1:27:05.014]: 
  Okay, so I know it sounds hypocritical, but seriously Street Fighter matches are over within a minute But why would you watch Minecraft for six?

 SPEAKER_06 [1:26:55.092 --> 1:26:57.353]: 
  Okay, so Zach

 SPEAKER_05 [1:27:05.014 --> 1:27:25.939]: 
  I never said I watched mine crept I would watch blood born or dark souls Because I want to see the strategy level for level moment to moment because it's not just a two three minute match It is a whole fucking game. I'm skipping hand you cut off I'm like, oh, I know what happens

 SPEAKER_06 [1:27:09.469 --> 1:27:13.232]: 
  Alright. If that put a C Why would you watch bloodborn Because I want to see

 SPEAKER_02 [1:27:21.113 --> 1:27:23.948]: 
  Do you skip ahead? Do you cut off?

 SPEAKER_07 [1:27:25.112 --> 1:27:33.533]: 
  I would watch a six hour let's play a song playing Minecraft if it was like an interesting concept Maybe they think

 SPEAKER_02 [1:27:30.732 --> 1:27:36.419]: 
  That's what you're going to do. Maybe they think it's fascinating that you sit and animate all day.

 SPEAKER_07 [1:27:36.047 --> 1:27:41.110]: 
  That's true. Would you really want to watch me do the same? No animation for 14 hours?

 SPEAKER_05 [1:27:38.393 --> 1:27:38.815]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:27:40.367 --> 1:27:49.784]:

 SPEAKER_05 [1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:17.680]: 
  It's gonna be very type consuming. I got swindled from Hollywood.

 SPEAKER_06 [1:35:27.619 --> 1:35:31.821]: 
  It looked like it looked like a fucking turkey I gave them a design show

 SPEAKER_05 [1:35:29.526 --> 1:35:35.078]: 
  I gave them a design sheet and it was supposed to look like Leon's saying three or four which is decent

 SPEAKER_06 [1:35:35.044 --> 1:35:39.060]: 
  I saw the episode, it looked so fucking bad. I swear it's on the screen.

 SPEAKER_07 [1:35:35.078 --> 1:35:35.095]:

 SPEAKER_05 [1:35:47.447 --> 1:35:48.089]: 
  Be fresh

 SPEAKER_05 [1:35:48.949 --> 1:35:55.277]:

 SPEAKER_06 [1:35:54.754 --> 1:35:57.994]: 
  I still think you should release it. Just for me it's a...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:35:57.994 --> 1:36:03.816]: 
  editing sleepycast and then sleepy cabin go into a halt everybody and then not having any income

  Beep beep beep beep beep there it is folks! Next question!

 SPEAKER_05 [1:36:07.022 --> 1:36:48.957]: 
  Alright, WinnillPunch is asking, what are your thoughts on tattoos? Cool, hot. How many is too many? Hey, you answer this, Vic. You answer this, because you have a fucking sleepy-cap tattoo. I am the only person in this group that has a tattoo. I'm getting one though, I'm getting half of it. A sleepy-cap tattoo. Yeah, well you- Do you regret the tattoo? No, all. I wouldn't regret that. I actually- Go for it for Vic. You was funny about that? No, no, no. It's funny because it's one of those things that I forget that I have it, and every single time I see it on me, I'm actually really fucking happy I am. Are you motivated? What's that? Are you motivated? Are you inspired? It doesn't necessarily motivate me. It just- Like- When I see it, I'm just happy to see it. I'm just- It makes me- It gives me a smile. This is shocking.

 SPEAKER_06 [1:36:15.797 --> 1:36:17.417]: 
  FN.

 SPEAKER_06 [1:36:21.552 --> 1:36:23.172]:

  This is a shocking amount of people would sleep together.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:36:50.796 --> 1:36:59.031]: 
  There are. There's actually, so far from Twitter, well there's at least eight people that have tweeted it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:36:53.159 --> 1:36:54.002]: 
  What could it do to me?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:36:54.002 --> 1:36:54.593]: 
  I think, right?

 SPEAKER_06 [1:36:58.474 --> 1:37:09.325]: 
  But the only reason is because the design is really good. Well, no, it's a great design. It's a good tattoo, regardless of what it stays. It's a good thing. The skeleton key is just a fucking sexy ass fucking design.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:37:00.938 --> 1:37:01.950]: 
  Well, no, it's a great-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:37:01.950 --> 1:37:03.064]: 
  It's a great thing.

  And I'm really fucking happy.

 SPEAKER_06 [1:37:27.162 --> 1:37:29.997]: 
  It's just that I know you never would that's the only reason

 SPEAKER_05 [1:37:29.727 --> 1:38:13.011]: 
  You know what it's the problem. I don't think I could any kid I would never I would never know what it's so funny Dude, I would have never ever ever I was one of those people who was like I'm never gonna need tattoo What the fuck would I ever commit to my body that I would ever actually want to put there?

 SPEAKER_07 [1:50:38.937 --> 1:50:51.914]: 
  Beyond the fashion beyond the games and beyond like the arcades and stuff. I just I've always been really fascinated the Japanese culture Over because American culture. I like Americans. I'm not gonna say like I'm not an American. I love America

 SPEAKER_05 [1:50:51.137 --> 1:51:04.030]: 
  Well, American culture is essentially a hodgepodge of cultures. When you think about like Japanese culture, it's very homogenous. It's a very isolated, very specific, laser- Maybe my-...crystallized, like, endpoint.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:51:01.482 --> 1:51:01.499]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:51:01.499 --> 1:51:11.185]:

  Yeah, exactly. Shit it.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:51:10.510 --> 1:51:26.305]: 
  Yeah, and Japan has been very faithful to making sure that what they present to the world has been very much like Representative out there. It's cool that you like on a train to Japan and you'll pass under a statue of a giant robot It's like that I did

 SPEAKER_01 [1:51:18.964 --> 1:51:21.006]: 
  Yeah, it's just cool that you can be like

 SPEAKER_07 [1:51:24.482 --> 1:51:31.587]: 
  That's shit that actually happens there. That idea is awesome to me. Because in America, we're too busy, we're worried about like the stuff that's gonna... They're like gun them, statues.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:51:30.270 --> 1:51:33.747]:

  You wouldn't go through fucking New York and see a giant Gundam statue in here.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:51:37.004 --> 1:52:37.939]: 
  My favorite story, one of my favorite stories as far as geek culture is concerned is that I went to one of the Sega arcades and there was House of the Dead. Oh that's cool dude. And there was this one guy, specifically one guy, Long Hair, and he was playing House of the Dead and he did it with like, it looked like he wasn't even looking at the screen. Is that his name? Long Hair. Long Hair, no. Long Hair. That would be a Chinese name, but he was like, he was at the Sega arcade and he played House of the Dead and it looked like he wasn't even looking at the screen, but he was playing two players with both guns and he did this thing where he was just like almost like doing a dance while he was playing. And you know what, that fascinates me. No, it looked like a guncotta thing and he was doing headshot, headshot, headshot, headshot, headshot. Now to be fair, I didn't even know in House of the Dead that you could do like a straight up headshot kill. Like I knew that that helped, but I didn't know that like if you only did Headshots in House of the Dead, that would actually like, you know.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:51:47.247 --> 1:51:48.006]: 
  Oh, that's a cool-

 SPEAKER_00 [1:51:47.500 --> 1:51:48.310]: 
  There were these guys.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:51:56.933 --> 1:51:59.447]: 
  Was that his name? Long hair? Yeah, okay.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:51:59.447 --> 1:52:00.443]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:52:00.443 --> 1:52:01.506]: 
  That would be a Chinese name.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:57:01.004 --> 1:57:23.802]: 
  So when I was 14 years old, I didn't convince someone to do this, but somebody convinced me. This is in a classroom. This is not even like in the cafeteria or outside of class. In a classroom before the class started, some students convinced me, and this is how being a loser I was, that if I squeezed lemon juice into my eyes, it tickled.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:57:01.949 --> 1:57:03.501]: 
  But I was 14 years old.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:57:24.494 --> 1:57:33.032]: 
  I Figured out my dad it was the one

 SPEAKER_06 [1:57:30.771 --> 1:57:51.527]: 
  My dad figured out it was the why my dad convinced me when I was about 10 years old that a huge square battery It'll tickle to what yes. He was very happy to see that a fucking electrocuted me. Oh my fucking right Zach. What? Yeah, what was called? What's actually for those huge? D-Battery yeah

 SPEAKER_07 [1:58:02.091 --> 1:58:11.001]: 
  My dad didn't really convince me, but when I was putting tar on a wall to lay down like as you do, it's serious.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:58:11.001 --> 1:58:14.427]: 
  It's scary! It's scary! It's really scary! I'm serious! So darn cool! Hot is hot!

 SPEAKER_06 [1:58:11.507 --> 1:58:12.959]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:58:32.736 --> 1:58:33.006]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_07 [1:58 --> 1:58:43.215]: 
  I have an idea of this, but...

 SPEAKER_07 [1:58:45.122 --> 1:58:46.995]: 
  Yeah, he's implored over the question.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:58:46.995 --> 1:58:50.877]: 
  Does he know about the sleepy cast? No.

 SPEAKER_07 [1:58:50.877 --> 1:58:53.880]: 
  Is he real? Yeah, he's 100% real.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:58:53.864 --> 1:59:00.040]: 
  Because there are so many stories by your dad that just blow my god damn mind.

 SPEAKER_07 [1:58:57.762 --> 1:59:06.452]: 
  Oh my god, you know I talked to Jeff about this everybody asked it's like it's like a fucking insane like my dad is like this crazy

 SPEAKER_05 [1:59:06.452 --> 1:59:09.945]: 
  He does not that weird, right? He's just, if you listen to the podcast...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:59:07.836 --> 1:59]: 
  It's just if you...

 SPEAKER_06 [1:59 --> 1:59:11.059]: 
  Listen to the podcast, you just...

 SPEAKER_07 [1:59:09.507 --> 1:59:16.847]: 
  the podcast he's just like fucking with me when I was younger and like acting like a child he fucking made you down to

 SPEAKER_05 [1:59:15.177 --> 1:59:21.437]: 
  He fucking made you bury tires. He fucking locked you in a basement.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:59:21.437 --> 1:59:25.420]: 
  weird if you understand human nature is dad's not that fucking strange

 SPEAKER_07 [1:59:25.420 --> 1:59:56.149]: 
  Really what it comes down to is my dad was just sort of a child. If you want to know the honest truth, my dad's father died when he was 13. So he didn't really know how to be a father when he was 13. And not to mention his mom. He had you with her. Yeah, no. His mom gave him everything he ever wanted. If his room was dirty, she would clean it up. He had no idea of the constant. What he does when he had you, Corey? Conscibility. He was like, I don't know, like he was 40 something. Oh. Maybe 30. Oh, so he grew up.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:59:39.426 --> 1:59:40.860]: 
  His mom.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:59:41.384 --> 1:59:42.059]: 
  Yeah, no.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:59:48.927 --> 1:59:51.846]: 
  What age was he when he had you, Corey?

 SPEAKER_04 [1:59:53.972 --> 1:59:54.951]: 
  Oh, maybe three.

 SPEAKER_05 [1:59:54.951 --> 1:59:59.912]: 
  Oh, so he grew up like a coddled faggot and like everything was kind of handed

 SPEAKER_07 [1:59:57.972 --> 2:00:25.512]: 
  Like everything was kinda handed to him. Exactly, everything was handed to him. He became very narcissistic. So the concept of a kid was just like, he would keep him around and love him, but he would also fuck with him. And his idea of fucking with him was just like, you know, as if it was like a college kid, he was just fucking with him when he was like eight. Cory, do you want kids? No, well, maybe when I'm older. You don't wanna repeat the same process. I don't, I don't wanna teach my kids to be like, hey, I have a sticker here.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:00:15.420 --> 2:00:15.994]:
