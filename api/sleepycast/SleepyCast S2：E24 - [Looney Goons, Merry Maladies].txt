  I feel like a funeral is one of the few things where you can't do a plus one. Yeah, I felt like a cocktail party was like a brother and friend. It's a funeral. I don't know, I think funerals are a lot of times a plus one. Yeah, honestly, if you were dead, would you mind? The more the merrier, dude. It's fucking five people showed up. I wish they would have won the war to do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, this guy looked pissed. He was sentimentalized. What if your murderer showed up in the raincoat that he killed you in?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:28.002 --> 0:02:28.964]:

  He was very effective. He was up to it. The look he gave me, I made it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:47.999 --> 0:02:56.959]: 
  The look he gave me made me think I was like, oh my god, he thinks I'm an acrophilia actress coming here to look at his dead parents. Like, because he's like... That's specifically what he thought. That's the first thing that came into my head.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:53.685 --> 0:02:53.719]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:53.719 --> 0:02:55.322]:

  That's it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:55.997 --> 0:03:02.680]: 
  into my head.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:58.140 --> 0:03:23.925]: 
  Mike, he cut onto your wily waist, he knew you were gonna fuck the bodies then. Cause the last person I dialed on my phone was my friend, whose house I was in, who I went to it with, so it like redialed it while everyone was having a moment of silence, and his ringtone was like some fucking really corny dance song that was like, pa pa pa, and it started playing like when everyone was quiet. Oh my god. And, that was a fucking Larry David moment. Why were you looking at your phone? I wasn't.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:58.444 --> 0:02:58.495]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:22.424 --> 0:03:35.333]: 
  Why were you looking at your phone? I wasn't looking at it, dialed in my pocket. Dude, you're supposed to... I'm telling you right now, you're supposed to turn... It's kind of like going on a movie theater, you turn your phone off, show respect for the movie... I should have dialed that. I got three. Fucking dumbass. Show your...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:30.945 --> 0:03:32.515]: 
  I should have done that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:34.422 --> 0:03:40.277]: 
  You don't sit there chomping on your popcorn. It's always wake, dude. You're right. You guys spin it up.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:37.004 --> 0:03:53.507]: 
  It's always wake dude. You gotta do the pump for the lab part during the wake. I don't wanna go to where it is. When everybody's howling like banshees over the last, you're supposed to go to the top. You're supposed to pump your fingers then so you can get some load slips. You're fucking burning up? Wait till you have the big one.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:42.353 --> 0:03:44.091]: 
  Screaming

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:47.365 --> 0:03:47.500]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:47.500 --> 0:03:48.968]: 
  I kind of knew I was going to die.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:50.537 --> 0:03:51.246]: 
  Bring fucking birdo

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:53.507 --> 0:03:59.869]: 
  fart and that way you can cover up the popcorn with a big fart. Is it the rip ass? Is it chew as much as you can?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:56.410 --> 0:04:19.444]: 
  Is it their rip ass? Yeah. Chew it. Chew as much as you can. To the left. To the left. To the left. It's like fucking crying in the back. Yeah, put a little popcorn bitch into the fucking dead body's mouth. Go to! If you took a dead body and you fucking put like a tennis ball into his mouth, and you smacked his cheeks together, or did the bottom like... Fucking heaven explode. It's heaven. His eyeballs. He's fucking triggering fucking...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:09.994 --> 0:04:12.525]: 
  You fucking put like a tennis ball in his mouth?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:14.770 --> 0:04:15.310]: 
  I'm fucking heavy

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:17.452 --> 0:04:20.355]: 
  He's fucking triggering the fucking way What if he put like a pink

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:19.444 --> 0:04:24.220]: 
  What if you put like a ping pong ball? Wait, no, that wouldn't work. You need to squeeze it out.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:22.465 --> 0:04:40.454]: 
  Well you need to quit it alright. You're gonna stick a ping pong ball and fucking slap the cheeks of the dead person No no, in there. And show up at the funeral just to do that. The heads would just fucking cape through his face. I was talking about in there. I was talking about like in the vagine. Oh, you stick it in the vagine. Is that possible? No, there's probably not enough questions. It's rigor mortis dude. Yeah, they're a little... It's tight as a clam.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:30.818 --> 0:04:34.024]: 
  I was talking about in the machine.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:35.543 --> 0:04:35.627]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:36.724 --> 0:04:37.821]: 
  It's where your mortis do

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:38.530 --> 0:04:43.558]: 
  It's hard. It's tight as a clam. No, but it also gasses up, so like, you have to release some.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:41.837 --> 0:05:17.882]: 
  So what you have to do, you have to massage the top of it to get a little like this. Get a little loose, get a little, then you can stick the golf ball inside and go. Listen now, it's not as bad as earlier, like a couple hours ago we went to Wawa and I would help Dwarf for a few people. With their body fell in. I saw a little Asian man, I said, he said thank you and I said you're welcome sir. And then he said that was a woman. It was. It was an Asian woman, but that was a true actual moment of racism. In which that's final, the first time like years where I've actually put my head up my mouth, unironically. Why is that racism though? Just not even, I guess more like. Because they all look the similar. Yeah, absolutely.

No, the short answer to the last question is this is the last season of sleepy cast as far as we know For all we fucking know everyone's gonna be relocated to the West and then for some reason we rebooted But for now everyone's splitting off in every fucking direction

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:57.795 --> 0:10:58.335]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:05.541 --> 0:11:09.102]: 
  We don't want to make promises and then it not happening. Yes, in fact, I'm probably

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:11.279 --> 0:11:13.506]: 
  We're gonna hear this

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:13.506 --> 0:11:15.750]: 
  already been announced. So, they'll know by then.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:15.008 --> 0:11:15.852]: 
  They don't know by that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:15.852 --> 0:11:15.869]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:18.636 --> 0:11:23.597]: 
  Episode 30 of Right is the License Season And there's no reason we wouldn't do intermittent ones whenever we're together Yeah, yeah, yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:23.125 --> 0:13:51.743]: 
  Yeah, I mean it's not like we were opposed to fucking sit around doing it. It's just that The weather's not splitting up and they're like why don't you do Skype and it's like dude Have you ever tried to have a fucking Skype conversation? Even Discord, like it's like Discord's really good, but there's still some latency I need to look in your I need to look in your bloodshot eyes It's not the same I need to smell You have to look at the person because they are directly interacting Busky scent, you know, to really get the feel of the room I was talking to him about this earlier, but my real thing was what this was like, you know It's sleepy cast is not something that should go on forever No That is like the reason we started the podcast was to was as in between stuff for our work While we but even the work itself that we were working on or trying to work on was kind of stuff We're doing between like big stuff like we we all had when sleepy cabins started sleepy cast started Everyone in the group had big stuff. They were working on Corey has this game We have my thing because his own shit Stamper has whoops behavior like we all have our own stuff. We said that so many times and people still say it's like Oh, you never really something that's my point is but the people need to realize all All of those bigger things for all of us are really speeding up in almost every case And so we're gonna be busy and to keep a promise to do the podcast all time is just like it would just straight us So it sounds game I think of sleepy cast like a little like a little summer camp like a little it should be the thing that happened It was a snapshot of our lives and we're all gonna overdose in LA and just as a practical fucking thing It's just so hard to fucking do when everyone's not here. Yeah, we Did it with the podcast we fucking three people every fucking time I mean Chris is gone. We can create a stampers been gone. Yeah, it's a prison. Say Daniel. He lives there now Yeah, Chris. Stamper's gone Chris is gone. I'll be gone. I'm probably Yeah, I'll be gone. I was gone the only people only people who are gonna be in Philly is me because I Game for the next two years. Yeah, you can you might relocate who knows? I mean that's the game who knows. Yeah, so it's just it's just impossible Don't look the reason we didn't hear it too is because it was a saw we all lived here We saw it the other thing I would point out to it that makes it even sad realize We're not friends because we did sleepy cast we did sleepy cast because we're friends So sleepy cast dissolving doesn't make a difference like I think for people being sad They're just sad that we're not gonna go. I get them my point is we're also friends We're gonna still make something if you like if you like power trip or any stuff cool I don't stamp or put out or anything. I made or anything that Chris made that was all made with all of our influence kind of mixed in there So that's not gonna exist. That's not gonna go away. Don't be stuff that we do. We just won't be doing Yeah, we're gonna be friends. We've been I mean corin I've known you for like fucking six years

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:27.124 --> 0:11:28.052]: 
  Everyone's splitting up.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:29.824 --> 0:11:32.929]: 
  Have you ever tried to have a fucking Skype conversation? Even Discord, like it's like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:37.097 --> 0:11:42.548]: 
  Shut up. It's not the same. I need to smell her. You have to look at the person because they are directly interacting.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:49.440 --> 0:12:51.415]: 
  three people every fucking time by the end

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:53.153 --> 0:12:54.435]:

  Yeah, we're all gonna be friends.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:51.389 --> 0:13:59.708]: 
  To be honest, actually this is kind of going off with Zaxxed is like those things are kind of speeding up So like they will be out sooner than later like it's

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:58.290 --> 0:18:12.495]: 
  Yeah, no, that's like I said, it's a little snapshot of our lives is gay that sounds because it is gay But that's like 600 hours of our fucking lives 600 Interesting transition or between kind of YouTube and the other side of things so yeah, but you know what I would also say this I say this optimistically but realistically to that sleepy cast may not come back as sleepy cast But I'm sure we're gonna do a podcast to get at some point for all the same cause Problem There's a ray even if it's not weekly just something yeah, you're gonna get something yeah, all right cool long answer for Biggest voted one those that was important So I'm glad we talked about yeah, um cool So an actual crocodile asks do you have any lies that you've been secretly maintaining for years? Lies lies. Do you have any lies that you've been hiding? I have one this was actually probably you're gonna be serious I swear to God, it's a rowing Couple years ago my first YouTube channel got shut down Oh, it was called it was called the psychic pebble because I used to go by psychic pebbles that are pebbles Okay, so that's why that's why I usually switch from pebbles as a pebble on different back and forth And I was trying to this is right around the time that Google was integrating the thing into YouTube and it maybe had me Said with an email address doesn't want to do that so I try to delete the email address I deleted my YouTube account It was so embarrassed about it that I told everybody that I got hacked I deleted my own YouTube account that is fucking This is a truth you're dairy That was that was the one that like laid up my mind for you But I can say it now because it happened like five years ago Yeah Yeah, you say those those horse stories and stuff Like when I heard that that stuff was happening where it's like really finicky with emails and stuff I heard like that kind of stuff like deleting your entire account. I was just like fuck that let this fucking Gmail shit pass. I don't want to deal with that kind of stuff. Let's think of a lie Like an actual that you've told or that you've held on to that you kind of even if it's a petty one like Yeah, oh, yeah, I've held on to yeah that you you always like I have a minor one But even actually it's not even I haven't really held on to it for the longest time I always told people I never met my dad that I you know that he left my parents when I was very very young But I've never actually that I never actually met him, but I did I did meet him once and it just seemed easier to say That I never met him Yeah, rather than like oh you didn't need him once yeah once when I was seven and he came Yeah, and he had a new wife and a new kid and he took me to Seattle Center And he got me trivial pursuit even though I was fucking seven and I could barely read That's right. You do anything. Yeah, so I think I mentioned it on the party So right the longest time I didn't I never I never said anything You know the other thing I did when I was a kid I told everybody that my dad looked like Mike Greenwell from the Boston Why my friend was really my friend Sean Cohn who's pitcher he I think he was a triple league Triple a league for a bunch of you go no no So he was in the baseball and I got into baseball cards because of him because he was cool And so I got baseball cards, you know, I'm this fat Asian kid and I didn't really you know I just played video games in eight and so he got me into baseball cards And then we'd always like trade because we buy them together and then he'd always like make me give the like he'd be like Oh, yeah, that card sucks. He's fucking take these cards They're always like the good cards and shit because he knew I couldn't appreciate it anyways Yeah, I guess one day I saw a picture of Mike Greenwell and I thought his name was Mike My biological father's name is Mike I just kind of put one and one together and kind of created a story and for the lot and for years and years and years I just told everybody. Hey, it looks like Mike Greenwell. It's a stupid lie But Chris most people don't know the fact that is like most people you talk, you know, what's weird It's like if I said this you probably wouldn't believe me But it's actually true that my dad looks like our red skin David Hasselhoff is kind of a little weight on the face 100% serious he has like and I don't know what this fucking Freddie Mercury nonsense came from but my dad looks like a kind of Red faced big ish on the face Freddie and our Freddie Mercury, but Hasselhoff Hasselhoff David Hasselhoff I didn't know what his fucking name was until I saw Spongebob, and I'm like

Yourself. I definitely have some. Oh, kids in school like a lie, you told about your personal life. I said, one time I lied to my dad like really badly about my grades to a point where actually, I think I might have said this story, but I told him, cause he wanted to see my report card, I told him that I got lost in the mail, and then they sent him a new one, and I got it before he got it, and I took it, and I ripped it up and I stuck it in a tree. It's a tree trunk, and I poured water in it, and then I put fucking dirt on it on top of it, and the tree was like in another person's fucking property, it was abandoned for years. So yeah, I got a D instead of a B. I lied to my dad that time. What's the longest lie you've told that you just told people that you're dead for the first time? Just cause it was easy to explain something. The longest lie? Yeah, like your longest maintained lie. You held on to it for a while. Longest maintained lie. Like so I was like, oh, how'd that happen?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:48.437 --> 0:21:43.939]:

I still have the footage from the other thing that you did with Stamper when we cleaned out the whole fucking office and you guys did the full-blown fight. Oh man. Which wasn't really a fight. They fucking sat around, so this is after he broke the, they were breaking fluorescent lights on their head. Yeah. And so that was the, you just saw the one where he smashes it and then, and Stamper broke one over his head too. But there were more lights after that and we filmed that too. And they were supposed to do a lightsaber fight. That was the plan. And dude, it was like fucking four in the morning, everyone was drunk and I needed to fucking go to bed. And they're like, no, no, no, we gotta do this, we gotta do this thing. So they orchestrate and choreograph a fight. They're like, yeah, I'm gonna come in, we'll do that, do that, do that, and then we smash. Dude. They fucking, they're like, alright, action. I fucking put it on the camera. They just charge each other and just fucking, they both smashed their fucking fluorescent lights against each other. And everything explodes, the end. But they had this whole fucking thing planned and that's all they fucking did. They like, maybe did a hop in the car.

But the short answer I guess for videos? Yeah, probably. Right? I mean, not here. Maybe in LA or something if we do something out there. That's so weird though. I heard of the whole, I can't say miracle. I always say miracle. But you know people used to play with it. Like adults used to give it to the kids to play with. Quicksilver. Because you put it in the palm of your hand and it was this metal that was like a liquid and you'd like roll around and you could just keep rolling it back and forth between your hands and then some fucking genius figured it out that if you rolled it back and forth between your hands too long all of a sudden it got smaller and smaller and smaller because it was fucking absorbing into their fucking skin. Jesus Christ. Yeah. Jesus dude. I didn't even know that. Human race full of them. Next we've got Anko Pro asks what's your own worst habit when it comes to work ethic and how do you get around it? Oh God. I would say procrastinating. It's weird because I always get my deadlines done. What do you do to procrastinate? It's not, it's what I don't do. Yeah but what are you doing when you procrastinate? That's like watching videos or fucking playing. Singing very loud throughout the house. Only when I make coffee to women. And shower. I don't do that. Yes you do. I do. I can hear you in the background.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:19.630 --> 0:22:25.249]: 
  Oh, that's right. That's right. That's where you got. Yeah, that's right. You lose your fucking life. Everyone will fucking go crazy.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:27.494 --> 0:22:28.827]: 
  But the short answer I guess

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:30.784 --> 0:22:34.395]: 
  I mean, not here, maybe in LA. Something if we do something out there.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:37.197 --> 0:22:38.462]: 
  I would say Mercury.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:00.400 --> 0:23:01.446]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:01.446 --> 0:23:01.514]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:19.367 --> 0:23:20.937]: 
  Yeah, but what are you doing when you...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:20.937 --> 0:23:21.679]: 
  While we all move along

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:27.535 --> 0:23:34.791]: 
  and shower.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:33.998 --> 0:24:18.936]: 
  Probably in my own room With procrastination it's usually either like what's your worst habit working? Yeah, what's your worst might put us use could be too but like yeah Yeah, it doesn't have to be procrastinating like like if I have a deadline on Friday or something like usually Monday I'll be just me kind of do a little bit of work and then like by Tuesday or Wednesday I'll be like oh shit Yeah, but I always get it done But it just just and I usually have a huge burst of energy around that time What would you say gets you over the procrastination just the real the reality of the line? Yeah, I will not get it done if I don't do it by this day all the hairs in your ass Just I'll get any better with it, but still it's fucking hard not to I have such a bad case of that Yeah, is that what would you say your worst? Oh have it when it comes to work ethic?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:35.753 --> 0:23:39.027]: 
  I definitely do. I am always... He's feeling this thick.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:46.418 --> 0:23:46.941]: 
  예예예

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:46.941 --> 0:23:48.190]: 
  It doesn't have to be progressing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:01.200 --> 0:24:01.740]: 
 ı

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:03.749 --> 0:24:04.373]: 
  The real

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:05.183 --> 0:24:07.562]: 
  of deadline in firing at your

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:10.229 --> 0:24:10.718]: 
  I'll get it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:13.941 --> 0:24:14.835]: 
  case of that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:18.936 --> 0:24:41.127]: 
  I think it's just laziness. And I've only come to terms with it recently. I called it procrastination too, but it's beyond that. I sit down, sometimes I want to work, and I hate, I'm so angry at myself for not working at that moment. Instead of working, I'm like, why am I working? Why am I browsing Reddit? I should be working, and I'm so disappointed.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:40.941 --> 0:25:27.533]: 
  It's sad while I'm still doing it. Sometimes I get sidetracked with porn, but it's not what you think. It's not porn. It's research. It's just the coded TEDx. It's research, yeah. It's like, I'm like, I see something and I'm like, I feel like I need to draw something and I'll like start sketching something out and I'll be like, I'm going to practice look up references and research and all the research and it's like, next thing I know I'm looking through all these poses and angles and I'm like, Alright, on a regular basis, what do you prefer in order to find your poses? Still shots that you Google or scrubbing through videos, scrubbing through videos to find the poses. I use just, I use image sites that have like cool, useful, not bad images. So you do just strictly go with pretty much images. I was actually wondering that. Real life references. I was wondering how you'd do that. Real life references. Real life references and you put your own exaggerated style twist to it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:41.127 --> 0:24:43.050]: 
  I'm still doing it

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:47.219 --> 0:24:50.256]: 
  It's research. It's just a cold, it's just a cold Terect.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:04.954 --> 0:25:05.815]: 
  Alright

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:05.005 --> 0:25:05.123]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:06.557 --> 0:25:06.709]: 
  This is the end of this video.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:11.485 --> 0:25:12.244]: 
  scrubbing

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:11.789 --> 0:25:13.004]: 
  Grubbing through videos.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:17.543 --> 0:25:19.450]: 
  So you do just strictly go with pretty much anything.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:19.450 --> 0:25:20.496]: 
  It was actually one or another.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:20.395 --> 0:25:22.825]: 
  Real life reference. I was wondering how you'd do that. Real life reference.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:26.993 --> 0:25:30.908]: 
  Well just to add to mine, I'm getting over that. Like recently I've been getting over.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:30.840 --> 0:26:48.044]: 
  Why would they ever stumble upon a legal porn, like children do? No, fuck no, I never go to those places. But I always try to at least try to get one thing done, even if it's minimal, even if it's something, I always try to get one thing of work done a day, always. No matter what I set a tiny goal, if it's like, today I'm gonna fucking sketch something out, today I'm gonna animate and sketch something out, today I'm gonna do something. See, that's the biggest thing, because if you set huge lofty deadlines or go through something, it's like, I already do 12 pieces of that. Like, today... Set what date? The thing I did today was I finished up a tiny bit of stuff and I exported it for Jeff, and I tested the game. So that's what I did. Those are my goals today. I tested this stuff. I actually know, I kind of have an idea of what to do for the next level, and I kind of discussed level... I guess I did a lot today, I don't even realize that I did that. It's because you set your goals low. Yeah. If you set your goals high, you're always gonna be disappointed, you're always gonna be discouraged, you're always gonna be... So that would be my number one problem, is that I always bought off more than I can chew. Though I would say, because we've already spoken about that, another... Well, I guess when it comes to my own work, my worst habit when it comes to work ethic is just saying yes to everything. So a lot of times, you know, people will be like, hey, I need a voice in this, bless you. God damn. Or, hey, I need this project, I need a website, I need blood, I've been in my natural reactions, always to say yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:30.908 --> 0:25:34.435]: 
  and haben reid streets

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:57.891 --> 0:25:59.005]: 
  What they

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:00.912 --> 0:26:01.587]: 
  Ways.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:40.922 --> 0:26:42.458]: 
  God damn.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:47.301 --> 0:26:50.592]: 
  Yeah, but that's like good though. I think that's a good thing like that

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:50.474 --> 0:27:16.242]: 
  That probably got you where you are too, because he's trolling. Yeah, the problem is that it can... everything suffers sometimes if I then bite off more than I can chew. Because the only way my schedule works is if everything I do is green-lit and everyone's okay with it, as soon as somebody has a problem or they need to edit or like there's a problem. So that'll affect? Yeah, everything gets backed up. And then it just gets really bad. Especially with the cons this year and everything else and traveling. My whole schedule's been fucked.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:51.756 --> 0:26:53.292]: 
  Yeah, the problem is that he's chosen.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:06.066 --> 0:27:06.960]: 
  It's a diagonal effect.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:16.174 --> 0:27:22.485]: 
  But Mick, were you always like that? Like I see in your house sometimes just like you have schedules for the day and just like bullet point bullet point bullet. Yes, I've been like that for a while.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:20.899 --> 0:27:21.439]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:22.401 --> 0:27:26.940]: 
  That's that I'd love to have like be able to do that make a list

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:26.417 --> 0:27:27.497]: 
  make a lot of them.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:26.940 --> 0:28:13.937]: 
  a lot of them. Lists work actually, I should do that more. They do. Lists with checkboxes next to the book. Yeah. I love checkboxes. I love me some checkboxes. I love me some checkboxes. Yo, I don't just do checkbox either. I don't even just do normal checkmark. Yo, listen. OK, so if you look at my Google Docs, I'll write it down on paper, but then I'll put it in my Google Docs. And I have code. I have little macros codes. So if I don't do something that day, I actually do a forward arrow. That box automatically, because it has forward arrow when it becomes yellow, and the whole list all of a sudden is highlighted. You've got to show me how to do that. That day is not complete. You need to show me how to do it. Then I'll move it on to the next list. And when I'm done with it, I'll go back and I throw a dash in it rather than an X, because I didn't complete it that day. So you get a bit of a punishment by after that just in time? Yes. And then after it's a dash and not a forward arrow, the whole list is now grayed out. You're fucking nuts. You're crazy. You're fucking nuts. I fucking love you're loonies. God damn. But you don't.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:31.058 --> 0:27:37.538]: 
  k g

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:54.734 --> 0:27:55.442]: 
  You gotta show me how to do it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:55.442 --> 0:27:57.349]: 
  That day is not complete. You need to show me how to do it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:03.407 --> 0:28:06.479]: 
  So you get a bit of a punishment by having that just in the back?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:09.381 --> 0:28:20.637]: 
  You're fucking right out crazy. You're fucking love your ludo. Yeah, but you read oh like I know this I hope there's no more but I'm just saying when you write a list on paper do you find that I think that's better for me like I like it more

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:13.448 --> 0:28:15.237]: 
  But do you agree though? Like, I know this is a-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:19.692 --> 0:29:54.512]: 
  I like it more paper if it's digital sometimes I feel like oh I can just copy and paste it around yeah Yeah, when it's a I and that's why even if I have a list written down on my computer I will hand write my list again I have a whiteboard and post it on the whiteboard It sounds weird because I keep a whiteboard while you're doing that But I have a segment to think off like with tape and I have one side where it's just like do this I write everything down each each task. Yeah, it's its own post it out But when it's done you either X out the red one pull it off and you see my room I also have like those I also it's not a whiteboard to cork board, but yeah I have those things if you guys are like Artists or the animator you have any kind of job out there I would honestly recommend the whiteboard like yeah, what's it called a cork board I wanted a cork wall at some point actually which actually is really helpful for a lot of things if you want to go to like If you wanted to go to like a Broadway show you print out tickets So you got a plane ticket or if you have a parking ticket just whatever bills just that you can just post things wherever you want Everything looks like a conspiracy theorist like nightmare Fucking like pieces of yarn connecting shit I tried doing the whole whiteboard thing and like staying organized But in the end of it I was just like I don't I'm not organized because I'm always doing something new each day I stick to that for a week and then I always fucking throw up. So it's like it's hard for me and also for me like I'm sporadic Yeah, suddenly I'll just be working and then I'll see like a hot picture of a character I'd be like, you know, I'm gonna draw this. You know the one huge negative about having a lot of lists and having you know Places where you organize those deadlines is that if you have a lot of them sometimes it can feel so futile Yeah, you because you'll stare at that board. You're like, I can't do this shit your balls just

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:28.585 --> 0:28:30.171]: 
  And then hold on to it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:45.173 --> 0:28:47.637]: 
  And you see my room, I also have like those, I also put it

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:48.987 --> 0:28:50.202]: 
  Yeah, we're having those.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:56.867 --> 0:28:56.884]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:56.884 --> 0:28:57.120]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:04.157 --> 0:29:04.849]: 
  Like go to like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:13.354 --> 0:29:20.948]: 
  Like you're fucking solving a murder mystery. Everything looks like a conspiracy theorist's nightmare. Fucking pieces of yarn.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:20.948 --> 0:29:22.450]: 
  connecting shit

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:29.318 --> 0:29:31.731]: 
  I stick to that for a week and then I always fucking throw it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:38.599 --> 0:29:39.122]: 
  You know the one

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:50.496 --> 0:29:51.559]: 
  You're like, I can't do this.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:52.487 --> 0:29:57.314]: 
  just Instead of like a multiple thing so you're just like I can't do this all over

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:56.335 --> 0:31:25.502]: 
  It all looks it yeah when you look at the whole grand scheme of things it looks so fucking impossible And so really what you end up having to do is segmenting it off like well What don't I have to do right now? You know like these are the immediate goals and then have them there in the background But you know what I mean like that's the only way I can kind of stay sane But honestly at this point things have kind of backed up to a critical mass. I need to I need to get some shit off my list Yeah, next next next Galatius Trogon asks What are your opinions on rotoscoped animation? I've heard some animators consider it lazier and shittier than traditional hand-drawn animation no matter the situation It's used those who don't know rotoscoping is animation done by drawing other Tracing it's chasing life. It's chasing. Yeah, I think there's a difference Because like you know like for instance like the old Disney the old Disney stuff like fucking the sword and the stone and Robin Hood Robin Hood Yeah, those were all rotoscope and it looked really fucking good, but it was done in a more stylistic style like they took Animation yet. Yeah, but they took real movements and they applied it to animation so they used real examples Well, it's almost like the rotoscoped the skeletons and then animated characters Yeah, in my opinion I think that is way more Amorable than simply tracing over something like it looks really stylized don't get me wrong rotoscope looks cool music videos and stuff But it looks a hell of a lot fucking better when it's done like how Disney The one problem is says if you deny that you wrote it. I was about to say yes

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:19.403 --> 0:30:20.061]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:26.946 --> 0:30:26.963]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:36.059 --> 0:30:39.349]: 
  It's chasing, it's chasing.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:49.710 --> 0:30:49.997]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:49.997 --> 0:30:50.942]: 
  Those were all...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:55.904 --> 0:30:57.456]: 
  Real smooth animation.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:02.907 --> 0:31:04.324]: 
  Well, it's almost like they wrote a script.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:04.324 --> 0:31:04.341]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:06.552 --> 0:31:08.239]: 
  Yeah, in my opinion.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:20.929 --> 0:31:20.997]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:20.997 --> 0:31:22.110]: 
  The one problem is

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:23.832 --> 0:31:31.088]: 
  I was about to say yes everyone knows we're animator we are like people like oh yeah no people everyone knows if you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:27.730 --> 0:31:34.328]: 
  Oh, yeah, no people everyone knows if you wrote a fucking

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:32.404 --> 0:31:36.572]: 
  Especially if they can pull up the fucking footage. Yeah. It's the fucking...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:34.986 --> 0:32:44.950]: 
  Yeah, it's the fucking animator I like I see these things all the time like I'm like Prowsing and I'm like oh I see a porn loop or I see some kind of like dirty like that sonic Mario kissing sex scene That was clearly That wasn't rosecode. No it was Like you see like just like characters fucking and their animations too smooth There's too much details in areas that you know people Yeah, it's actually the upsist usually choppy. Yeah, because it doesn't have the cartoonish fluidity Looks like you are what kind of general because they don't really know how to roast the proper But you can tell it's the boot. It's the way it moves not the actual it's a mixed bag because it's like sometimes like that But then there's some people who trace key things of it But you can still tell it because of the the anatomy is way too accurate. Yeah, there's no way There's just some things when you look at an artist and you see like I'm not saying like I'm a fucking genius But when I look at artists and I see like this is their art piece of them doing it And I see they're like anatomy and then I see this example and their fucking like faces are on point Their elbow details like their arm detail stuff nobody thinks about it's usually the details It's usually the details. It's like overly detailed You don't have to be fucking like, you know, we have to be like the best datameter of all time to have the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:42.546 --> 0:31:42.664]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:43.373 --> 0:31:44.790]: 
  Like that Sonic Mario

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:46.022 --> 0:31:49.229]: 
  That was clearly really drawn.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:50.309 --> 0:31:51.861]: 
  They got a real headshot.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:58.088 --> 0:31:58.172]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:58.172 --> 0:31:58.915]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:00.400 --> 0:32:01.632]: 
  Yeah, because he doesn't have

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:11.132 --> 0:32:11.622]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:11.571 --> 0:32:11.790]: 
  something

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:18.979 --> 0:32:19.924]: 
  Yeah. There's no

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:32.732 --> 0:32:33.627]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:36.647 --> 0:32:37.609]: 
  It's usually the details.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:38.301 --> 0:32:38.993]: 
  It's the details.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:38.993 --> 0:32:41.912]: 
  It's like overly detailed. You don't have to be fucking like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:43.988 --> 0:32:48.544]: 
  No, when the character has the same face as the animator and is suspicious sometimes.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:46.941 --> 0:33:00.154]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, suspicious sometimes you see people like yeah, people are recording I mean I don't even care that much. I mean I don't necessarily like it, but it's like why do I know it's gonna deny it though? No, no, it's just the one reason why I didn't care It's the denial. How would I say it?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:50.637 --> 0:32:51.447]: 
  I mean, I don't even care.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:54.518 --> 0:32:55.446]: 
  انہوں чутьٹدائ contemporary

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:55.446 --> 0:33:03.445]: 
  No, no, it's just that I don't be the one reason why I didn't care. It's the denial. Most of the time when I say it, like Mark M or the guy who did the double dragon thing.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:02.078 --> 0:33:34.495]: 
  But he's not gonna deny it. He doesn't care. I think when I see it a lot of times stylistically I think it's really charming mark and this really good rotoscope. It's really interesting This fucking Halloween video All it like all this stuff recently has just been like I'm not not dogged on it But all like when he does like the realistic like detailed faces and he does like random keys with them talking Yeah, but it's not like it's like rotoscope shots Like it's like I'm gonna say a bunch of stuff and I'm gonna draw over that with a face But you can tell it's like we're going to add some

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:02.939 --> 0:33:03.749]: 
  But he's not gonna

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:04.120 --> 0:33:06.077]: 
  He doesn't care.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:04.508 --> 0:33:04.626]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:10.414 --> 0:33:11.511]: 
  It's really interesting.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:12.490 --> 0:33:13.030]: 
  Yeah, it's a game.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:15.426 --> 0:33:15.797]: 
  Bom...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:25.163 --> 0:33:25.450]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:33.398 --> 0:33:46.409]: 
  This rose-cooping adds to the comedy though. Yeah, the style of it. Because he drew like a character just out of his head. And then on the next frame, the proportions are completely different.

Asking what's the most uncomfortable situation you've been in? This one right now. Most uh wait wait I have a recent one it's when I was downstairs uh and I came downstairs and there was a bunch of guys Zach and and and Corey and a bunch of people I believe now you may or may not have been there but everyone was watching cringe videos and they kind of migrated from cringe to kind of like almost weird fetish videos like butter fetish and and diaper fart fetish like full diaper full diaper not just normal diaper it had to be a full diaper. It was it was diaper full. Yeah diaper full. The only problem with these videos is you have to sign in. Yeah well oh no see this is a different situation you're talking about last night okay I'm talking about another time this happened okay this happens all the time and and all of a sudden I realized Zach had the controller in his hand and every time they watched one of these videos he would fucking he would he would push down or something and all of a sudden this little menu appeared where you could thumb up a video and he kept liking these videos I was like oh I didn't even know you could do that on our app in the house. What was happening was it was like two or three weeks ago and everybody the whole the whole class was there clapping and they all brought their popcorn and stuff for fucking snack. And I was typing in fart sounds. He was cringing. I was typing in fart sounds like ass sounds and it was like a couple of issues and guys were like and I was clicking like I like like 45 videos. Also I'm sorry at some point he had the deaf guy talk fucking kissing his mom's corpse. And I clicked back and he was like what channel is this on and he was like he had like a panic attack and he bolted upstairs and he's fucking he said he's just he's just like he's just like he's just like he's just like full of like like like rice pot like the farty ass calculation 12. It's just as sweet as his full as his pet. He's even like a fucking apology tweet. Okay, okay, I gotta say something. Okay, well I have to say something. Sandra if you're out there. Oh yeah.

  Yuck, which is spaghetti-o's and you fucking walk on it would have to go Fucking scared dude. I would do molasses asks a lot of you guys have started streaming art regularly What do you think are the benefits of streaming and do you see it as a practical way for artists to attract attention? Oh, I should say something controversial and this is what I personally believe is happening. Okay, so

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:03.141 --> 0:42:03.782]: 
  What do you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:09.435 --> 0:42:10.515]: 
  Oh, shit.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:14.970 --> 0:46:05.297]: 
  YouTube when YouTube started it was like, you know original whatever it was just like videos and stuff Then it originated to vlogs and let's plays But what I personally believe is that it's now the future of streaming and I feel like it's the future Like it's like this is where Everyone's going to like why would you watch a 40 minute? Let's play series when you just watch the person play the full game on stream. What do you think's next? I personally think like the whole 3d VR Streaming is important because not saying it's important to stay like hit but it's all it's important because You can consistently talk directly to the people while you're working It's no longer this like weird edited process where you're looking in through a window and seeing them After it's done. You can see them while they're doing it. Yeah and get a reaction. Yeah And you can directly Communicate and work with them and make stuff and it's definitely more positive than just simply spending like a hundred years making content That was literally the main thing for me Like I haven't really my I just recently got partnered But I haven't set up donations yet and I may but I think for me the biggest thing was is as an animator Spending so much time in a vacuum that you know when you animate something like before before I streamed literally Nobody saw the process and then what after a month of me trying to juggle a cartoon with work I spit out some fucking minute and a half cartoon that maybe people watch maybe they don't for a minute and a half I mean it's fucking rather than if I'm gonna spend you know X amount of hours working on something Why and it's the purpose is to entertain people it's to connect with people Yeah, even if it's in a cartoon great also granted like I haven't been streaming as much But this is my own personal reason right now. I'm waiting to get a more beefier PC So I'm kind of laying off on streaming and focusing on work until I can get a better PC I'll still try to stream but my PC is very bad at the moment So I'm not streaming currently, but I will start streaming eventually Everybody here want to plug your Twitter. We did it before but my name is on twitch. It's basket. It's fast cast I think Just cry burger cries berber. I'm just CRY Yeah, and I'm rice pirate Mick because somebody took rice pirate But yeah, I mean I do think it's a Mickey said like the interesting part about it is before people don't really not animators Did really understand how the process went. Yeah, they just saw the end result Right, so I think see any I mean we talked about it a little bit as I go it sucks It's hard yada yada yada, but that doesn't really do it justice But if you watch how long it takes to draw a friend or draw a background or whatever you go Oh, you kind of get a yeah I mean there's still gonna be that plenty of youtubers out there who say the most fucking ridiculous That's I prefer strictly community-based things like the discord and the subreddit Yeah, and like directly through Twitter and like twitch and stuff talking directly that way You know, they've already gone out of their way to watch you. Yeah, those means so they've already gone a step above the ladder You know someone's pissed or they're fucking trying to like troll me on Twitter at least There yeah, they're directly Yeah, well, yeah, I read I read all comments on you know YouTube everything else I said that I certainly respect some comments more than others like on YouTube. It's like okay It's a great assault. It's like it's YouTube comments. Yeah, no I mean I Rescued their meter because my biggest problem is everybody's fighting for the like system everybody's looking to get thumbs up It's like it's like it's a competition It's a stupid system where everybody just fights to get the funniest thing voted up and then like there's a million comments Inside of that and it's just like it's a mess like you open up a comment board is a million But you know you can see the purpose of it though The purpose of it would be to have the most pertinent comments at the top But nobody but whatever that's like the internet was made to connect people for informational purposes But instead we use it to watch fucking people shit and diapers and jack off

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:36.891 --> 0:42:37.448]: 
  What do you think's next?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:37.448 --> 0:42:37.515]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:57.495 --> 0:42:58.727]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:06.794 --> 0:43:07.452]: 
  That was literally...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:42.552 --> 0:43:42.957]:

  You played it. Youinding where you want to hit this.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:50.204 --> 0:44:53.089]: 
  ideas

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:54.692 --> 0:44:57.004]: 
  I do. I'm so fucking down with YouTube. I prefer

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:15.617 --> 0:45:19.634]: 
  at least they're going there. Yeah, they're directly engaging me. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:30.332 --> 0:45:33.522]: 
  No, I mean I was like because they're being a big problem is everybody

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:30.569 --> 0:45:30.788]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:36.914 --> 0:45:38.449]: 
  It's a competition.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:38.449 --> 0:45:40.424]: 
  really bad solution to do the work.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:50.430 --> 0:45:53.130]: 
  But you know you can see the purpose of it though. The purpose of it would be...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:56.489 --> 0:45:58.480]: 
  But that's like the internet was made.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:01.821 --> 0:46:02.614]: 
  to watch fucking

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:04.504 --> 0:46:12.807]: 
  Yeah, it's like the fucking all the whole reticentality is happening. It's like everyone thinks they're a comedian, you know It's like yeah, but it's the same shit rehash over and over again. Yeah, like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:09.516 --> 0:46:10.005]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:12.402 --> 0:49:46.039]: 
  Yeah, like voting and down voting and it's a part, it's what happens, like people, it's like in the same thing with Twitter, you say something funny or you say something controversial to get likes and retweets. And it's the same way, it's like, you know, it's just, it's a way of life, but for me, like when I look at YouTube, it would be the equivalence of being like, okay, I worked on a video my whole, for like fucking six months, because even though the process of working on the music video for Aaron, I stream for a month straight, every day, for a month straight, for 12 hours, every day I stream for a month. And then when I finally put it out, it's like the comments were just like, it wasn't very good. Or like people were like, it was good. Or they were like, wow, Aaron, your style changed so much. Yeah, and it's just like, so it's a mixed bag, you're just like, oh, okay. That's, see, that's the battle for me. And you would rather get the direct communication with people. You know, I still use that video as an example of how fucking stupid so many viewers are. Sorry, this isn't you guys, you guys are brilliant. You guys are smart and special and wonderful, and I love you all, but Jesus Christ. Yeah, special, your comments. When you put out that, or when Aaron put out that video, not only is your name in the title, he says your name out loud at the beginning of the video. You're at the end of the end. It's there and at the end, and it's in the description. Like I get it, people don't read the description, but are they not reading the title or even listening to Aaron talk in the beginning? Cause how does your comments still say, oh, Aaron, yeah, good job with the cartoon. Yeah, oh, your style really changed. It's just like, how fucking stupid, like how brain dead are you? That you could not figure that out. I'll give you an example of that recently. I do it on the new Yada things they do and stuff. I feel like, yeah. Recently our boy H3H3 got sued. Got sued by a guy called Matt Hoffman. It's the long Arabic name. Anyways, he does a series on YouTube called Bold Guy. He has a few different ones. Anyways, so he's still eating. I thought, before you say that, I thought it was fucking Matt Hoffman. Who's that? He's the BMX fucking, he's like the professional. Fuckin' Tony Hawk, dude. He's like Tony Hawk with fucking bikes. No, but he was the stuff that you got him. I was like Matt Hoffman is fucking suing Ethan. And I was like, oh, Matt Hoffman was a joke. It's just what I just like, weird political pickpocket. Anyways, let's say weird, that's liable. Bold Guy? Is it liable? It's liable, right? Just liable. Point is, point is, he filed a lawsuit against Ethan and I drew that guy that was suing Ethan for his video where he talks about it. I drew a caricature of the guy and Ethan flashed it on the screen and said like, so is that, thanks to Psychic Pebble for drawing this or whatever. The description said the same thing. And I was getting comments on my YouTube channel that was getting tweets that were like, you suing Ethan, you fucking little bitch. You will never bring Ethan's empire down. And I was like, what the fuck? Like, I just bothered me. It might just- These are people who get news from fucking 4chan, okay? These are people who log into 4chan with their fucking sippy cups and they just sit there and believe every fucking piece of trash they read. I'll tell you, 4chan is one of the funniest places to ever go because some of these people they give me stuff like, hey, someone's saying to you. Or there's a thread to it, someone says they're making here. And you look at those and it's like, they say things as such a matter of fact. You're like really- They know so much better than everybody else. You were telling me there was a thread about Nile. No, there was a thread about one of us and there was a few things that were said. One of the things was said was like, wow. They said something about helping us but it was so matter of fact as if they knew. And they're like, wow, 2chan Nile had the most stable job of any of these fucking idiots. Because you helped, not even if it was, my point is like, because you helped Sandra with the coloring for the- Oh, they thought I was- They said that you worked at Cartoon Network. And the rest of us were lazy, but it was like-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:45.359 --> 0:46:46.253]: 
  Or they were like, wow.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:47.670 --> 0:46:48.362]: 
  Yeah, it is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:50.505 --> 0:46:52.328]: 
  That's it. You'd rather get the door.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:53.408 --> 0:46:53.948]: 
  You know, I still...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:58.184 --> 0:46:59.449]: 
  Sorry, this isn't you guys.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:02.993 --> 0:47:04.005]:

  You will come down to do that out.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:39.595 --> 0:47:40.844]: 
  things they do and stuff like that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:44.590 --> 0:47:47.054]: 
  That's sued by a guy called Matthew.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:02.444 --> 0:48:02.950]: 
  Welcome Tony.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:02.950 --> 0:48:06.004]: 
  She's like Tony Hawk with fucking chucks.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:06.004 --> 0:48:07.759]: 
  He was a super skater who was a gay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:10.004 --> 0:48:10.358]: 
  It is like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:11.489 --> 0:48:12.130]: 
  He likes it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:14.762 --> 0:48:16.500]: 
  Anyways, don't say weird, that's liable.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:17.918 --> 0:48:18.660]: 
  Okay

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:20.500 --> 0:48:23.267]: 
  I don't know. Point is! Point is! Point is! He's spitting.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:00.882 --> 0:49:02.181]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:13.909 --> 0:49:15.377]: 
  Oh, they know so.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:39.002 --> 0:49:40.622]: 
  Oh, they thought I was... This is how.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:42.428 --> 0:49:44.554]: 
  Oh, you were looking at Cartoon Network again.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:46.883 --> 0:49:54.713]: 
  I'll take it. My point is, it's just like the guy said so many facts and all the replies were like, yeah. Figures. You notice on those figures.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:48.722 --> 0:49:49.920]: 
  But the guys said so bad.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:52.064 --> 0:50:05.496]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:05.496 --> 0:50:45.102]: 
  And then people like this nasally faggot. Yeah, but then it'd be me I was like waiting for it to be me and then it happened once it doesn't bother me because you Like I said, well two points for the first point I'd make is like you're never gonna please anybody if you if you really want to do That you're just you living in a fantasy the one I've always told people is like imagine or think about The person you think is the best musician of all time or the best filmmaker the best comedian your favorite comedian Probably still is hated by like 60% of the population. We hated yeah, because there's no Physically, you're not gonna please you can't do it. So that does a bother me The thing is like you read like yeah, just there how matter of fact they are like this is the way it is It's like no you're literally making shit up because you want to sound informed

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:32.580 --> 0:50:33.525]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:45.034 --> 0:50:56.965]: 
  Did I tell you about the time when someone on 4chan pretended to be me? That's happened to all of us. And he answered the question so correctly I was like, did I like... Did you black out and fucking do it? It was so like, and he was polite and I was like... You're not even islanding!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:47.498 --> 0:50:48.544]: 
  That's happening with all of us.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:51.295 --> 0:50:53.826]: 
  Did you black out and fucking do it?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:55.919 --> 0:52:28.866]: 
  You're not even Nile anymore. You actually stolen somebody else's identity. The real Nile is out there on the board. To be able to fucking mimic me, you gotta have some fucking like, you had to go to my school fucking lexicon, because there's no goddamn way you'd be able to copy my way of typing. Like the type of fucking me. People do this shit on YouTube too. I never put comments, but sometimes I put capital letters in Questingmerks and fucking comments in random places. What's your favorite 4chan board, Corey? I don't know 4chan. I guess there's like boards, but when I used to go to 4chan, I went on fucking Swift and D and all those fucking places in Aruse. What is Swift and what is D? D is like a Fuda, like She-Mail porn. It's alternative porn basically. The video game one is pretty decent. V used to fucking suck. I don't know if it got any better, but it used to be terrible. It used to just be the game equivalence of fucking B. I hate talking about 4chan like it's a fucking letter. It's actually a thing to talk about. It's cool. The dude sold 4chan as some fucking guy who sells everybody's information. Did he? Yeah, if you're still going on 4chan, there's a guy who's putting all your personal information now for the public to take. It should be common knowledge by now that 4chan is a hot box for stealing your information. From what I've heard, I don't know if that's true, but I remember the dude selling it to some shady Japanese guy. Alright, enough. Are you tired of being trolled by a troll? You trolled me hard. Time to troll. I'm giving Nick PTSD about his 4chan experience.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:00.677 --> 0:51:02.365]: 
  to be able to spade like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:04.609 --> 0:51:04.980]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:10.667 --> 0:51:13.232]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:23.914 --> 0:51:24.944]: 
  I mean, I guess there's...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:24.944 --> 0:51:25.939]: 
  I guess there's like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:32.622 --> 0:51:35.963]: 
  What is Swift and what is Deast?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:40.080 --> 0:51:41.802]: 
  The video game one is pretty decent.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:41.633 --> 0:51:41.734]:

  What's something you've done?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:16.994 --> 0:54:36.812]: 
  so hunts me. Um, fucking I can count the, it's like a laundry list man. Like, I think we talked a little bit about this one, that's what we did. Yeah. We talked about this before, but I would just say, yeah, look at our Newgrounds reviews. Yeah, look at our Newgrounds reviews. That's all you're gonna do is go to the art fucking Newgrounds reviews, like the reviews they did for like people's art pieces and their fucking flashes. I was just, you guys kept all yours up, didn't you? I want, I think I had to have Delet a few, but the really old ones. You guys, it wasn't just Zach. So some of you guys got a little, I have a removed Rikidiki about keeping those things up, got a little paranoid. I have removed anything. What? Yeah, about keeping up those old reviews. No, no, no, the ones I had Delet a room for like 2006, they were the opposite. They weren't like the meat ones. They were just the really bad ones. I think if you go to my Newgrounds or Chorys or Chris's or Stamper's, you'll find some fucking views. I read them pretty much. I don't leave reviews anymore. And it's like, it's a weird thing where it's like, I had enjoyment in knowing that I would blam someone's cartoon and ruin their day. Now when I see a cartoon, even when it's shitty, I just don't even want to be like, lamb. I just, I feel bad. So I'll like just ignore it. And then if I see someone do a good job, I'll give it a five. So it's like, I don't even feel like ruining someone's day. So I'm just like, fuck it. I don't even want to do this. Come so fuck, boy. I don't even feel like making someone fucking cry. All right, cool. Disabled grandma asks.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:27.929 --> 0:53:30.443]:

People can get offended by anything. Anything. I'm saying offended. I'm saying how do you get affected? You say how do you get fucked by a ghost? How do you get raped by a ghost? I'm not saying that. I'm not saying how do I get triggered by looking at my fat titties when I jump into the shower. Cory, did you watch Ghostbusters 1? We're dead. I think it's a fucking blowjob from a ghost. That's a documentary my friend. Two turns to a fucking schizo and goes on and on. That's fucking found fun. Yeah, that turns into a real crazy person. Ghostbusters 3 is just the aftermath of his fucking... Ghostbusters 3 is Dan Akra and Lurikig live. The aliens will never talk to us after 9-11. He's scared of a way. It's Ghostbusters 3. Lurikig looks so scared during that interview. Lurikig crawls back into his fucking coffin and descends back into the earth. Fire and flames and fucking... I'm gonna go sleep for 40 more years. Alright, Soysocks asks, for the whole sleepy crew, are there any podcasts or radio shows that any of you listen to? So which ones? Oh, Soysocks. I actually don't really listen to anything.

  I actually don't run.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:30.503 --> 1:10:32.629]: 
  I think I'm the only one on the podcast.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:32.427 --> 1:11:15.002]: 
  You listen to Joe Rogan, you're a big Roganite, right? I don't listen to him. You take Alpha Ray. No, I don't. I used to listen to him. First time, Niall would always fucking talk to me about Alpha Ray. Like, dude, you wonder why I'm such an Alpha. You wonder why my brain is so Alpha. It's because I take Alpha Ray. Dude, I went up to you, pulled your headphones on, I heard fucking like, da, da, da, da. I put it back down and was like, you know what you listen to. What was that? Most of all happened is like, sometimes a video will appear in my feed, like my YouTube recommended, like sometimes it'll be like an Anteclip or like a, you know, like Joe Rogan or like even like Howard Stern, like sometimes I get like recommended clips. Yeah. That are like 30 minutes or something. I'll just watch them sometimes. But I've never like got out of my way to listen to entire like podcasts and keep up with them. I don't listen to them. The only Howard Stern clips I always see is like, pornstar talks about first gang-bang experience. Yeah, I watch it. I watch that.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:37.337 --> 1:10:38.080]: 
  I used to love you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:44.880 --> 1:10:45.606]: 
  Dude, I don't wanna...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:49.504 --> 1:10:51.040]: 
  All at once.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:01.519 --> 1:11:01.722]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:09.062 --> 1:11:09.737]: 
  I don't listen to you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:12.471 --> 1:11:16.673]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:16.116 --> 1:12:30.670]: 
  The last one I watched was the one with Billy West and John K. Yeah, oh, so I got it. It's super fucking awkward. Weird. You know the story behind that? No. But that's an interesting combo. Well, so because Billy West did voice his first, but Stimpy and but. Oh, which one's it? He did. Oh, he was the dad or? No, he did it for actors. No, he did one of the K. He did a, I wish for which one's which. I've never watched one of Stimpy. Which one is Billy West? The Rem. Wait, the small one. Stimpy. Stigno's one. Fucking. The Rem and Stimpy is both Billy West. Stimpy's the cat. Yeah, Stimpy. He also voices Rem. Well, that's the thing. So after John K. got like, I don't know the whole story, but like, I guess he got canned and a lot of the, a lot of the people on the show for it, Stimpy, like decided to walk. And I guess they offered John K. Billy West. They were some kind of deal to come back and do the voice. And he also did the voice of the other guy, Rem. The Stimpy, whichever one. Yeah. The Red Cat and the. He did be. But if I put it this, he ended up doing both. He ended up doing both the characters, which John K. voiced the one of them. Yeah. And everyone left. And so that's. So it was a bit of a traitor. Yeah. There was a good discrepancy and cut up rivalry there. And so how it started being the fucking shit story is invited to both on. And since John K. seems a little bit kind of apprehensive as a person anyways. Yeah. And it's like Billy West just like blushing and smiling really awkwardly. It's like 1997. It's really old. Do they know he could?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:18.782 --> 1:11:20.436]: 
  Yeah, it's super fucked up.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:20.436 --> 1:11:21.027]: 
  Weird.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:22.444 --> 1:11:24.267]: 
  No, but that's an interesting combo.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:28.047 --> 1:11:31.675]: 
  What was he doing? Oh, he was a dad? No, he did it for a male. No, after.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:39.117 --> 1:11:41.715]: 
  They're running stimpiest both the way left.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:43.572 --> 1:11:45.816]: 
  Well, I g rather it is yours

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:05.357 --> 1:12:05.492]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:05.492 --> 1:12:07.112]: 
  The red cat and the swallow.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:09.357 --> 1:12:09.593]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:12.850 --> 1:12:14.858]: 
  So it's a bit of a trade-off.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:23.616 --> 1:12:24.460]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:29.826 --> 1:12:31.767]: 
  Yeah, they know each other we're like going on it

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:31.665 --> 1:12:39.749]: 
  I know I think so but it anyways that's the last thing I watch but I don't really watch So besides like opiate anything like how it's doing like the kid that but I just like that's clip

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:39.327 --> 1:12:44.744]: 
  I think Obi-an and Anthony are insufferable, but for some reason their show is entertaining sometimes. It's fascinating to watch.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:43.242 --> 1:13:03.239]: 
  It's it's fascinating to watch after the whole thing with the whole Anthony. They was keeping up with it That's it. It's like a whole like it's like a fucking way what happened with Anthony So if they got fired like a year and a half or two years ago because he took pictures of some of like some place in New York And some black lady like attacked him. He went on Twitter calls like a monkey or something

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:48.355 --> 1:12:49.384]: 
  No, no, no.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:49.992 --> 1:12:50.835]: 
  I can't take a fucking...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:50.835 --> 1:12:51.713]: 
  going to the Anthony.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:02.091 --> 1:13:07.002]: 
  Not because she was black, but he was just saying... No, it was because she was black.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:05.432 --> 1:13:47.822]: 
  I know I he said he says he's right but my point is he his argument was he was just saying that she was an animal He called it an animal not a monkey, so he called it an animal not a monkey correct myself calls an animal and Siri the network serious or whatever Fucking fired him because of it and they just had Jim and Opie and then Anthony went up and did his own thing But there's a bunch of other weird drama like they came out and sent shit about each other And Anthony got arrested for like his his girlfriend accused of a be her yeah There's a whole that's been a popular thing lately a lot of Johnny Depp recently Yes, why Johnny Depp recently yeah, he's wife or what yes, she's filed a restraining order Who's he really to what's her name? Amber? Amber? I don't know what she does. I don't know So let's see that really awkward

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:18.915]: 
  That gives me the dangerous part.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:37.495 --> 1:13:39.334]: 
  Mas já me deram por isso?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:42.304 --> 1:13:59.939]: 
  Who's you've been into what's her name? I don't know what you see that really awkward apology video. They both made like two weeks ago before no to who? How did I do Australia wait both of them both of them were forced to make an apology video to Australia because she smuggled her dogs without being vid

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:50.759 --> 1:13:53.475]: 
  No, to who? To Australia. Wait, both of them?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:59.449 --> 1:14:01.525]: 
  I'll be embedded in task

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:00.546 --> 1:14:12.595]: 
  Oh, yeah, I was like Australia is a very good country. I love it. Wait, this is post divorce though, right? No, no, well this happened like two weeks ago. They're only getting the divorce now. Okay, she only files. I am told you Oh, this is a worry beat the shit out of her

 SPEAKER_00 [1:14:04.664 --> 1:14:04.950]:

  This is...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:10.013 --> 1:14:27.782]: 
  Wait, I am totally out of a loop. But this is before he beat the shit out of her a few weeks ago. That's proven that Johnny Depp beat the shit of his wife? No, no, no, it's not proven. He made a counter claim saying that she's lying and she had photos, but you know, you know, I don't know. It doesn't fucking matter. It's this fucking TMZ bullshit. I completely wonder what it really is.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:15.379 --> 1:14:16.054]: 
  No, no, no.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:21.353 --> 1:14:23.024]:

I'm gonna that's gay watch that's super power and they'd say why then they'd be like okay But then like people but they would say stuff that like I would think what's the gimmick? What's the hook here?

It's fucking it's extinct Yeah, they were but they were really funny start talking I used to listen to roughly on occasion I would listen to it way back then I would listen to the rooster teeth podcast Because I like some of the guys on rooster teeth, but now I don't listen to it There's like hundreds of people that do it and the only ones I'd like that are really on there But a start off is one that's more if you fucking geek That's really good back on the way it's just the other guys Tyson as a podcast with coho sometimes We just talks about I'll take questions.

Stars, baby. Korea, say, make 64 does a podcast also, but they're like an episode like 1000. Yeah, never. And they haven't watched a single one. I don't even know how it is. I've never heard a lot of nothing against it, but I've just never because it's like, where do you start? You start episode one, work your way up. It's like I heard a lot of good things about that. And it's topical, like it's topical stuff. Yes. And I try to avoid topical stuff because I feel like it's like I don't want to know. Like I don't want to get up. I've heard a lot of good things about Grandma's Vigility podcast. If you know that was Justin Rylan. There's like some like idiot boxes. Another one, everyone's always clamoring about it. I've never even heard of it. I like to recommend a lot of these with ours or so. I don't feel like this. Yeah, yeah, I see. Next question. All right. Next question. Cool. Next up we got, if you could change this is needs more whammy asks if you could change anything about your body, what would it be besides a larger dongas? First of all, none of us in the sleepy cabin crew have any concerns about the size of our don guy. I don't know. But me myself, I would eliminate a lot of body hair from different parts of my body, including my neck, which then bleeds into my back and also my chest. I basically have an entire fur. I am a wolf man, but I create the illusion of not having that by having regular shearing sessions. Oh, I would eliminate my hand kill ass and replace it with a nice plump one. What would you why would you care about your ass? Do you look at it? Because I have a hand kill ass. So what? What's a hand kill ass? Why? What's the problem? It doesn't feel good when you sit down. He's got a big juicy black girl ass. Just a big, veiny fucking black girl ass. You had a big juicy Latina ass. Sat down. You that shit would fucking you look like a farmer standing in your body. I'm telling you right now, it's like sitting on a fucking waterbed over the walkover. No J Lo be like, I like your ass. You're like, Oh, thank you. Be like, no, I mean, like I want your ass. Literally, I'd love to have. But the cellulite would remain. I don't know if that's like a turn on. I know. Would you look at your own butt and be like, my modification should be I'd be buff. The better what I ate. That's a possibility. Oh, modification. You change. I guess so. Oh, I guess you could say metabolism then, right? No, but I mean, like if I could, I could pick it up. Pick out like a body, like a fucking, you know, you pay your walls. They give you like a thing to flip through. Get like where those are. Like that one. I would absolutely get a fast metabolism. I would turn. I would I would fucking trade in my juicy ass for. My metabolism was fine. It's what about sucks. It's more about time. Like it's more about like, you know, I'm not. That's something I can't work out, but it's a lot harder when you're fucking. Fucking juicy ass or eating food. Red knackin responded with less man boobs is probably the most popular answer to that question. What a fucking. You know, what's your name? You better whip those babies out. We're shaking around. Nice titties. With those fucking bay torpedoes at your little beach. Is that what you call those titties? Who was I could make a fucking dance together? Dancing unison. Nice titties.

  Oh!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:23:04.208 --> 1:24:04.182]: 
  You're like, well, since you're here, you might as well do it. Classic misconceptions. Yeah. What I would do is I'd get three of the strongest people and fucking roll them down a flight of stairs and see who rips apart first. I would put Hillary, Donald Trump. Trump will be in the front so we could talk. And Ted Cruz. I put Hillary. Ted Cruz would be in the back because he'd love it. No. You and I would do. Ted would love it. I put Hillary in the middle. No, no. There's no middle. I'd make like a little triangle with them. Like I'd just fucking like bend them into a circle. Ted Cruz would be so fucking donut. Ted Cruz would be so fucking horny from that. He's such a creepy. He'd probably be licking his lips. Yeah, but he's so upset though because he couldn't do any of his impressions while he had his mouth fucking stuck doing that. What's he going to be tied to? Okay, so this turned out, so Trump would be the front because he'd be like, I love being the front. I love being the leader of all this. And then Hillary would be in the middle. She'd be trying to cackle but her fucking teeth is like carved into an ass. She eats shit anyways for a minute. No, she's going to eat and shit. Political. She would personally be like, can I sit in the middle? What's your question?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:06.064 --> 1:23:09.726]: 
  Blessing this conceptions.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:18.501 --> 1:23:20.779]: 
  And take a close!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:19.547 --> 1:23:19.902]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:21.927 --> 1:23:22.450]: 
  No!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:22.450 --> 1:23:23.007]: 
  You would have been

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:24.002 --> 1:23:24.947]: 
  I will read the bill.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:31.579 --> 1:23:32.946]: 
  Ted Cruz is gonna

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:37.857 --> 1:23:38.565]: 
  Yeah, but he's so...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:38.565 --> 1:23:39.460]: 
  I said though, because you can

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:41.856 --> 1:23:42.396]: 
  What is what's

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:53.280 --> 1:23:53.719]: 
  She's

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:55.457 --> 1:23:59.440]: 
  Oh! She's gonna eat shit so she- P-P-P-P-P-POLITICAL!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:04.941 --> 1:24:18.492]: 
  She could be in another line. She's pretty much the Christian of politics. So we have Trump, Hillary. I have the best shit. Would it be Bernie and then Ted Cruz? To lick at his lips and be like, this calls for at least a Simpson impression.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:19.437 --> 1:27:01.926]: 
  You'll fuck this dude, I gotta do at least a Simpson. My kids are waiting. I'm gonna kiss them on the fucking mouth. All right. So that's what we would do with the presidential campaign. Return them into fucking human therapy and then make them watch this. Yeah, exactly. That's exactly what I'd do. All right, we gotta get just a few more in here. It's getting a little bit late. This is an interesting one. I think it's a pretty short answer. I don't think we have to get too in depth. Clam Chop asks, here's my question. How difficult is it financially to live as an artist? Is the stereotype of the starving artist true? Yes. Or any artist you know? Thanks. Yes. Yes. It is stupid to not go into art without having a secondary job. Just remember this. While we may have some audiences and stuff, and yes, we probably live a little bit better than some people out there, the truth is that art for 99.99999999% of people across all times of the universe has always been a very difficult thing to make a living off of. If you see one successful person, there is millions of other very talented, if not more talented people, that are dying gutters alone. It's supposed talent, some parts luck, some parts skill with that. Yeah, it's luck, skill who you know and talent. And really what it comes down to is it's not simply like, you can't just get popular. You can, but it's like, even then so, it's luck. Because you could sit there and pander and do everything people want, but some people might, it might not catch on. You could spend on this time. It is a matter of what interest you give to people. You need to bring something to the table that they don't get from anyone else. But I would also, I think I've said it before in the podcast, but if you see artists like us or you see other artists, and you think they're rich because they have a lot of followers, Twitter followers don't equal money. Yeah, Twitter followers. Subscribers on YouTube don't equal money. No. What I would say is, if you want money and you want fame, be a lawyer or a doctor. Don't be a fucking animator because it's a long, long process. And there's no guarantee you're gonna get to the end in the title of the 18th film. Do animation and art strictly as a hobby until you feel comfortable enough to switch over and start making a living. Yeah, keep it good. Pursue your other life, continue. I mean, I know that makes it hypocritical because we've all, a lot of us have, didn't go to college or we didn't drop down. That's because it hit us early on the art part, hit us early enough when we can do that. If you're not at a point where you can quit your job, definitely, it definitely gets income from that. Then don't do it. Have a back, always have a backup plan. What the fuck is up with these like death trains? Zeroes driving through streets. It was just on fire, just going by. All these charred bodies in the windows, flames flickered. Let's do three more. Do the lightning round. Lightning round, go, go, go. Lightning round. Read off as much as you can. We have five minutes. Do the lightning round, Joe.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:28.887 --> 1:24:30.794]: 
  Yeah, exactly. This is exactly what I do.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:50.554 --> 1:24:52.849]: 
  Yes, yes, it is it is too

 SPEAKER_01 [1:25:26.194 --> 1:25:27.426]: 
  It's supposed to.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:25:29.485 --> 1:25:30.936]: 
  Yeah, it's luck, skill,

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:16.583 --> 1:26:17.832]: 
  Do animation art.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:21.544 --> 1:26:22.995]: 
  Yeah, keep it good for...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:46.165 --> 1:26:48.949]: 
  0s drive through stree- it was just cute

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:51.531 --> 1:26:53.050]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:57.100 --> 1:27:05.993]: 
  Let it go, go, go, go, let it read off as much as you can. You're gonna do the lightning round. Lightning round. Ba-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:26:57.505 --> 1:26:57.994]: 
 go go go

 SPEAKER_03 [1:27:10.262 --> 1:28:43.750]: 
  Alright, cool. Press restart asks, the year is 2025. YouTube finally died. As animators, you're still employed because you actually have talent. You walk into a Wendy's to see Markiplier ready to take your order. No. What do you order and what do you say to him while flaunting your wads of animator cash? What a fictional reality. It's so far out there that it's like almost impossible to answer. They're really obvious. Mizarro means an asshole. I want to go up to Markiplier and throw my animator. In 2025, apparently YouTube's dead and therefore on animators, yeah, but the animators, dude, in 2025 it's all going to be stream fame, streamer fame. Yes. It's going to be people eating cereal. What do you think it'll be by 2025? I don't know because look, I mean YouTube is like it started, YouTube very, very early started with like vloggers. That was the big thing. Yeah. And then it was like sketch handles like Smosh and the big head up. Now it's less plays. And then it was, yeah, then it was like kind of, yeah, there was less plays. And now it's almost like these list guys and these like there's a few different. Top 10 list. Top 10, they're everywhere now. Then it's going to be streamers too. Then it's going to be something else. It's always cyclical. Every five or six years, the whole thing wipes out completely, the whole system cleans. How many guys that were there for five or six years ago are still relevant? Does anybody talk about iJustine? No. Onision. Onision. What the buck? I mean, Oh my God. Exactly, exactly. Wait, well, who was that one kid that gay kid? Fred. Fred. Fred. He's like 27. He was on Nickelodeon or something, right? Yeah, no.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:27:22.244 --> 1:27:23.948]: 
  You're ready to take your order.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:27:25.315 --> 1:27:26.479]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:27:37.819 --> 1:27:38.967]:

  Oh my god.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:28:35.633 --> 1:28:36.443]: 
  Exactly, exactly.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:28:36.443 --> 1:28:36.949]: 
  오 후식

 SPEAKER_01 [1:28:41.961 --> 1:28:47.429]: 
  No, I was looking back on what the book and the poor guy gets okay ladies and gentlemen views

 SPEAKER_03 [1:28:45.741 --> 1:30:31.379]: 
  Okay, let me round. He's not even a bad guy, I'm just saying. Oh yeah, let me round. My point is, fuck you, you question that. Yeah, fucking you, Bizarro World asks. Sticky buns, one asks, what are your pet peeves? Mine is people who talk during movies. Or don't pay attention to it. So they'd be like, hey, let's watch a movie tonight. People are like, hey, yeah, yeah. And then while we're watching it, they're on their phone or they get up and walk out of the room. I hate that, I hate that. And it's like, do you want me to pause or do you want me to? Okay. I hate when you're like, I want to see them really badly. You watch it on their phone, they're like, what happened? It's like, oh, don't you? I think, but there's one pet peeve I remember that I always get tired of seeing is when I'm looking at porn and the way people draw characters, they give them like these little tiny buttholes and they have like huge genitalia. It's like, it's not right, it's inaccurate. I hate photos when it's called like blow job and then the girl just fits on the dick and gives them a hair drop. That's not a blow job. Yeah, that's not a blow job. I also hate it when they say gang bang and it's just two guys banging a girl. I'm like, that's not a gang bang. It's a threesome. Yeah. That's them getting fucking sexual terms incorrect. All right, cool. Next we've got, Coney, 2012 is relevant asks, do you think some things are off limits when it comes to comedy? What are some things you don't really like to joke about? I... No, I say no. Everything is fair. Maybe you shouldn't die or be a loser in life. I don't necessarily like everything but I believe everything is fair. I think the two biggest things, the only two things that matter in a joke are context and intent. If you make a bad joke about somebody's recently deceased like grandfathers. Also time. That probably means you have bad intent. Also time. Like there's... No, I don't think even time means... No, there's like a thing. Like if somebody, like, you know, if someone just dies and you make a fucking joke. Okay, I guess the three things would be context and intent and time. I guess. But time is really context. Or two to three. That's like... It's really subjective.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:28:48.829 --> 1:28:49.504]: 
  Oh yeah, let him in.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:28:48.947 --> 1:28:50.804]:

  I hate that, I hate that. And it's like, do you want me to pause?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:29:16.065 --> 1:29:17.331]: 
  I think, but there's one that gave our

 SPEAKER_02 [1:29:28.199 --> 1:29:29.228]: 
  I hate photos.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:29:33.514 --> 1:29:34.830]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:30:19.499 --> 1:30:20.005]: 
  No, there's like a...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:30:26.215 --> 1:30:26.282]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:30:26.282 --> 1:30:26.940]: 
  Yeah, it's exactly...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:30:28.797 --> 1:30:36.323]: 
  or to read that's like it's really that's like chronological context where does it fall in the yeah yeah that falls into college like the California

 SPEAKER_03 [1:30:32.813 --> 1:31:33.175]: 
  Where is it falling? Yeah, that falls into context. There's a school shooting that went on in California, right? It's like a school shooting that went to California. Today in heaven? And people were making jokes about that. That would be in foretaste. People were talking about, well, everything went too busy. Stuff from their face with avocado sandwiches. They could have avoided the gunfire. That would be... The one tweet I ever made that I actually deleted and regretted was, the date, the hour, when Robin Williams died. I wrote... This is no flubber. I said, oh, so this means no Mrs. Nothfire 2. And I was like, that was a mean guy. You know the ironic thing is there wasn't Mrs. Nothfire 2. I know that's why I was saying it. But my point, I was like, I didn't sit right. I was like, that's probably not cool. I took it down. All the replies were like, oh. And it wasn't because of that that I took it down. I was like, no, that's... But I think it's just funny. If you make a rape joke and a rape victim hears it, and they feel bad about it, that sucks. But there are so many things in the world to be upset about. I don't...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:30:39.816 --> 1:30:42.972]: 
  Today? Yeah, if you're ready. Today's heaven? Yeah. What?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:30:44.305 --> 1:30:44.507]: 
  about that.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:30:44.507 --> 1:30:45.520]: 
  That would be important.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:30:53.114 --> 1:30:53.569]: 
  You know.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:31:03.002 --> 1:31:04.369]: 
  This is no flubber

 SPEAKER_02 [1:31:08.909 --> 1:31:10.090]: 
  You know the ironic thing is...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:31:32.432 --> 1:31:36.280]: 
  I was telling a rape victim like making a joke about that.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:31:35.672 --> 1:32:50.091]: 
  Walk up to a rape victim knowing they have had experiences like that and then say tell you a rape that is negative And that that goes against it. So that's why you right like you see a rape victim You know, they're a rape victim they sleep on a banana peel and you're like, oh, is that how you got raped that last time too? Right, right Dick if you're on stage as a comedian you tell you jokes again somebody from the audience That's a completely appropriate context and setting to tell a joke like that because you know there are two tell jokes Yeah, it's just the whole like if you can make fun of one thing how are you not allowed to you know? I mean whether it's religion or what I'll make one quick point before I go on one quick point You have two options in life option number one is to go into everyone's brains and to tweak everybody's behavior exactly So everyone's fine tuned exactly to your behaviors and your your offenses in your you know how you behave Yeah, you can tweak how everybody behaves as not to offend you or you could just have thick skin Those are your two options in life. Can I do one more? You don't get the picking shoes. Mick What's the last question on the questions? Alright last question look there's a lot of these here Unfortunately, we only got enough time to do one last question Let's just pick it a random let's see last one last one. Okay. Here's a short one Scars 98 asks how long could you oh how long can you hold your breath? Not really a I think if I don't do you actually count or try it. Let's do it. Yeah, let's do it

 SPEAKER_01 [1:31:38.609 --> 1:31:38.642]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:31:42.355 --> 1:31:42.507]: 
  right

 SPEAKER_01 [1:31:45.342 --> 1:31:46.034]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:31:47.670 --> 1:31:51.248]: 
  rate that last time too. Right, right. But if you're slipping onto some dick.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:32:32.524 --> 1:32:34.718]: 
  One last question.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:32:44.354 --> 1:32:45.940]: 
  I could probably go to the audience.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:32:45.940 --> 1:32:50.699]: 
  Do you actually count or try it? Let's do it. Yeah, let's do it. Okay. We'll find out
