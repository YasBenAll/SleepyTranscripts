And we're just like, why are they fucking walking so slowly? They just hate their lives. They're just stumbling. They're so fucking bored. And then they fucking, we wait around. They could have diabetes. They could have fake feet. They could have penguins. All of them definitely have diabetes. They're all definitely made of 40% wood.

  Yeah, they just hate that.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:10:38.001 --> 0:10:40.212]: 
  They're just stumbling, they're so fucking bored.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:44.802 --> 0:10:47.451]: 
  All of them definitely have diabetes. They're all definitely made for...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:47.451 --> 0:10:48.734]: 
  Maybe they should have got longer.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:57.222 --> 0:13:31.679]: 
  But like, no at this point, at this point we're like what the fuck is taking so long right? We're getting really antsy and annoyed. Of course, it's been hours in the hot sun! Especially me, I'm like, I'm a cranky boy when I haven't eaten right? So, we get to the front of the queue and now it's about to happen again. We literally see them say something like, oh don't let them on. We're like, are you fucking serious? And we're like, errrr, right? And then they're like, oh wait no no no, there's four, let them on. So we're like, thank you right? Yeah. So it's five of us, so we all can't fit on one. So Corey, Lexi, and Waffle sit in one capsule with a random person, oh with David. And then me and Veronica sit on a capsule with one random person at an empty seat, right? So it takes ten minutes to get us on, get us buckled, they're walking back and forth going, errrr, errr, did your seat work? It's like, yes, like fucking assume so. The adjustment thing is weird, because they're like pull it down, lift it up, pull it down, lift it up. Yeah, they made us do that like ten times, right? We're like, what is going on? What is this? Fucking stand up, like what is this? Like people, there was children were holding up, like we thought we're gonna fucking die, like they didn't know what was going on. Yeah, alright, so finally, finally, the fucking ride, we pull down the things that keep you locked in so you don't like flap out and die, and it starts moving slowly, we're like, yay, right? Clear sailing. But then, right, within a minute Veronica starts screaming, right? I'm just like, what the fuck is your problem? She's like, it's not supposed to go this high, and I'm just like, what are you talking about? And like, it goes really fucking high, like five times in a row. It's supposed to hit its peak once, and then I'm like, stop. Swinging, yes, swinging battleship or that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's like going to the point where it can't go no more, and then... And it's like clanking up against the media. And then it's going back around and doing it, and it's... It did it five times! So I'm fucking, I'm screaming by fucking mind, like my eyes and everything, I can't even believe what's going on, and I had no idea. I thought this was just like, oh, maybe I'm just overthinking it. Yeah. So then it does this five times, right? And I'm just like, I'm enjoying myself, because if I'm going to die, it might as well be like this. This is fun, right? Getting flung into fucking the stratosphere on a fucking pirate ship, not T-Farm ride. Yeah, right? So then we're like, see Veronica, you're just being a big baby, right? And then it's just like slowing down, but then it gets to this point where it doesn't stop. It just keeps like swinging back and forth and back and forth. It eventually stops with the kinetic force. No, wait, wait, before that, it did this for 15 minutes. Yeah, it wouldn't stop. 15 minutes, it swayed back and forth, right? And then look over at Corey's, like... I was so sick, because I was doing this and this and this and that, and like that. I'm like, I'm going to die. Veronica's brother, David, is like spitting little bubbles out and spitting it onto the floor, because he's about to throw up.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:11:04.309 --> 0:11:05.963]: 
  Of course, spend hours in the hot spot.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:43.949 --> 0:11:45.602]: 
  Yeah. Fucking assume so. The adjustment.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:47.897 --> 0:11:49.365]: 
  Yeah, they made us do that like 10

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:49.990 --> 0:11:50.462]: 
  Bye, Mike.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:11:56.487 --> 0:11:58.714]: 
  I didn't know what was going on.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:15.218 --> 0:12:15.302]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:12:25.157 --> 0:12:27.233]: 
  and then I'm gonna show up. Swinging, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:27.233 --> 0:12:30.861]: 
  Sweeying battleship

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:32.667 --> 0:12:35.468]: 
  No more and then clanking up against

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:36.143 --> 0:12:38.438]: 
  It's like doing it. It is. Five times.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:38.438 --> 0:12:42.758]: 
  So I'm fucking, I'm screaming my fucking mind.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:55.229 --> 0:12:55.465]: 
  Get it?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:57.979 --> 0:12:58.840]: 
  Oh, I'm gonna fucking die.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:59.852 --> 0:13:00.983]: 
  That's a pretty farmed ride.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:12.964 --> 0:13:14.415]: 
  Wait, wait, wait, Corey, before that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:21.233 --> 0:13:22.347]: 
  I was so sick.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:24.355 --> 0:13:25.452]: 
  right now

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:26.279 --> 0:13:26.481]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:30.565 --> 0:13:33.265]: 
  He's about to throw up the gravity at this point

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:32.860 --> 0:13:49.178]: 
  They drop the floor. So the steel floor lowers down for you to start the ride. So the floor is still down. We're hanging about five, six feet off the ground, right? Yeah. So we're still swaying back and forth. And now I'm just like, this is fucking hilarious, right? But then the girl on my right, she starts going,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:49.178 --> 0:13:53.954]: 
  LogRide LogRide LogRide LogRide LogRideicker Logride Dog federations Logride log外

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:53.312 --> 0:13:59.674]:

  What's up?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:32.999 --> 0:18:34.956]: 
  and he tried to lock them out.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:43.005 --> 0:18:45.942]: 
  for an hour that they just start turning on each other.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:45.216 --> 0:18:51.105]: 
  Yeah, the conditions have to be slightly slightly off to what they should be wait, but there's like a perfect

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:49.249 --> 0:19:15.270]: 
  But there's like a possibility goes out the window. There's a perfect conclusion is when we got off that ride The girl thank you. No, that's the thing her her carer came over wearing a like autism t-shirt And she said that must have been so horrible for you. I'm so sorry and in my mind. I'm just like I completely deserve And then we tried getting a refund and tried to go home I wait to wait around another hour to wait for that wait away

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:06.141 --> 0:19:07.947]: 
  I completely deserve this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:14.444 --> 0:19:17.279]: 
  Yeah, we had to wait for it. Did you get refled? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:16.840 --> 0:19:26.999]: 
  Yeah, actually no, she said we did but her money never got returned. Are you fucking serious dude? So thanks knots well now we have a recorded so fuck them welcome to odds very far

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:27.859 --> 0:21:19.167]: 
  No, it's like, it was pretty concerning when we went in like after that. I mean, they gave us complimentary water, which was nice at the very fucking least, but we'd been there for an hour in the sun. Complimentary water. Yeah, complimentary water bottles. And it's like, we... You would think like at that point, they'd be like, here's a free fast pass for the rest of the day. Yeah, it's like anything. But we weren't going to do that because at this point, it's like Final Destination 2. Like, our heads are going to be fucked off if we got on a roller coaster. He would have died on the next fucking thing. We all passed out on the car on the way back. Like, we were so tired. Maybe those two rides before this one were signs. You know that story about how like the guy who drowns waiting for God to save him, you know, there's like a flood and he's on his roof. And the guy comes by with a little paddle boat and he's like, come on in. I can save you. He's like, no, no, no, I'm good. I'm going to pray to God. God will save me. And then another guy comes in with another boat, like a motor boat. He's like, come on, you got to get in before the water rises. He's like, no, I'm going to wait for God. And then finally the water rises all the way and he drowns. It goes to heaven. He's like, God, why didn't you fucking save me? I prayed to you three times and he's like, I tried twice. Yeah, you're dumb. You idiot. You idiot. What did you think? The beams would pick you up like an alien. You'd be saved that way. I think this was your signs. Absolutely. I fucking think the same thing because like after that, I physically wouldn't get on another ride. I was terrified of the outcome that would have happened. Yeah. I feel like after something like that, I don't know if I could like I'd be scarred a little bit. It was scary. It wasn't that bad. I mean, the last ride was that bad. But it's not like the setup wouldn't be so bad. Like if there were two rides that crashed and the last one worked, I'd be like, OK, we had two shitty rides that didn't work. Yeah. But this was in a row and it escalated ever so slightly. It was like we couldn't even get to the ride the first time. Right. And the second time we got to the ride, but it crashed. But it wasn't working. The third time we got on the ride, but it crashed. The fourth time is what can you go from there? Death. Never again.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:38.828 --> 0:19:42.996]: 
  complimentary water bottle. And it's like,

He's like Man her voice was genetically engineered to be perfectly annoying like It was like certainly terrible It's really it's really strange that they were able to feel like people Yeah, and the funny thing is like these people who work at the place were coming over with a small screwdriver prying the fucking thing And they're like, I don't know what's happening Then they show up with ladders and they freed everybody after that it blows my mind Like they couldn't get us out seven people and I was like yeah smash the fucking wires and make all the things turn out or make A spin to death or something really took a while. Yeah, it was ridiculous But uh, how would you rate Knott's very far? I would rate it a negative the first time I went was good. Okay, and then this time was not so maybe a three out of five Okay, yeah, that's fair or 2.5. You know what that's fair when rides start closing down And there's like like right before your eyes. Yeah, you know, I think it's time to close that's why I don't like Thieparks is because they can have rides break down and you don't get reimbursed at all It's like I paid to ride on rides. So what the fuck am I doing here those lines? I went to uh

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:06.332 --> 0:22:07.446]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:08.061 --> 0:23:11.369]: 
  Yeah, you know I think it's time to close that's why I don't like the park

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:19.992 --> 0:23:29.003]: 
  I went to an event for, there was a company sponsored an event and it was over at the Harry Potter World, which is pretty close by. There was nobody there, it was just the company.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:28.919 --> 0:24:53.007]: 
  So like just getting up there with nobody in front of you still took like 15 minutes to get to the fucking no dude Some rides take an hour or two. Yeah, it's a warning these winding snaking fucking line who the fuck pays to do that I don't get it fast past and it's like still waiting Where do you got you have to have like a plastic bag to pee in while you're fucking waiting? Yeah, I'm fucking silly what's funny is like on the silver bullet They actually had something on the TV which is probably clever, but also conniving in some degree conniving Yeah, cuz it was like making chicken wings and like deep frying them and showing people eating that stuff on a TV while you're in line And they were showing people drinking stuff and it's like that is Imagine if you were at a concert. Yeah, and while you're watching a concert fucking McDonald's ad popped on and some dude was eating a burger You'd been there for 11 hours You'd be like this is evil and it's like the beginning of a movie when they show you like the popcorn and the coca-cola Yes, and all that shit except that would be running the entire time on the side screen Exactly, so it's like a very like wow. No, we're definitely in a California theme park Yeah, like they're they're Nick. They're squeezing any little bit out We can we talk about the moral dilemma of that log rides? No, no like laughing at autism if you laugh at an autist on one hand watch your back because you may be drowning in a fucking water And they'll be knocking going Who's the next target Chris is it Is it evil to laugh at autistic humor? No, the thing is like it's not

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:36.158 --> 0:23:37.609]: 
  Yeah, we do. It's retarded.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:39.449 --> 0:23:41.862]: 
  Who the fuck pays to do that? I don't get it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:23:43.701 --> 0:23:43.937]: 
  Please.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:43.937 --> 0:23:44.494]: 
  This is where the God used to be.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:44.494 --> 0:23:45.051]: 
  You have to have a good one.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:46.992 --> 0:23:47.700]: 
  Yeah, lines

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:16.034 --> 0:24:17.080]: 
  And that's like the beginning of a-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:20.050 --> 0:24:20.354]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:23.644 --> 0:24:25.298]: 
  while the movie was going. Exactly.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:24:29.196 --> 0:24:29.770]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:31.137 --> 0:24:32.200]: 
  any little bit out.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:35.187 --> 0:24:35.946]: 
  No, no.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:40.806 --> 0:24:42.021]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:44.282 --> 0:24:45.683]: 
 大家好

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:53.007 --> 0:24:58.694]: 
  If you left me at a person no, that's the thing. I'm not like you're a loser

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:55.757 --> 0:25:03.368]: 
  No, that's the thing. I'm not like you're a fucking loser. I'm laughing at the behavior. God, it's not boring. God designed us to laugh at silly things.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:59.487 --> 0:25:01.140]: 
  Gave God a slide before dog

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:59.774 --> 0:24:59.993]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:01.140 --> 0:25:01.377]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:02.339 --> 0:25:10.827]: 
  It's the comedy. What's the comedy? It's the comedy. If a regular person said something, something that an autistic person said, it would still be funny. Yeah, exactly. I'm laughing because it's funny.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:08.751 --> 0:25:58.870]: 
  Yeah, exactly. I like because it's funny. It's the comedy of the delivery. Like when a bear is about to be captured, he's like, oh no, Joe, that'll be captured. And then he gets captured. You can't write that! No one can fucking write that! It's like, it's perfect. Another reason is because I actually genuinely enjoyed autistic shit as a kid. I love it. I grew up enjoying Sonic and the nostalgia critic. I'm not against- I'm on the spectrum for sure. I figured you guys would just hate watching that stuff. I'm 100% autistic if you look at the shit I'm into. But at the same time, it's like I also appreciate it in some next level where I could never make anything on this level. This is like an art form that you can't reach unless you have a certain mindset for reality. You legitimately can't think of the things they think of. You can't do it. Even nostalgia critic tries and he still can't do it. You can't do it. He can't play the part. He's not an actor. I don't think he's quite as bad as some of the people that- He's not fully autistic. He's on the spectrum. He's on the spectrum, but he's still-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:17.087 --> 0:25:17.155]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:23.348 --> 0:25:23.415]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:26.841 --> 0:25:34.064]: 
  I grew up I'm not a spectrum

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:35.785 --> 0:25:36.004]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:44.256 --> 0:25:44.948]: 
  we'll see you next week.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:44.948 --> 0:25:47.361]: 
  You legitimately can't do it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:48.222 --> 0:25:48.492]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:51.124 --> 0:25:52.035]: 
  You're looking kind of dope.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:53.065 --> 0:25:55.461]: 
  I think he's quite as bad as some of the people that...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:57.351 --> 0:26:03.915]: 
  He's on the spectrum, but he still files like W lines and shit. He's not like dysfunctional. Yeah, he files

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:01.840 --> 0:26:05.907]: 
  He files W9s, but he has his big lip alligator memes

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:06.362 --> 0:26:09.670]: 
  What the fuck is that? That's a reference. What the fuck is that thing?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:07.392 --> 0:26:16.808]: 
  That's a reference. What the fuck is a big elevator beam? It's a big lift alligator moment, Zach. Yeah. What the fuck is that mean? How do you not know what that is? I don't know what that is. That's important.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:12.488 --> 0:26:14.209]: 
  What the fuck is that?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:15.677 --> 0:26:16.352]: 
  That's true.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:17.550 --> 0:26:24.402]: 
  That's important in NC history. Was it? And then solve it. It's like a bat credit card. The bat credit card? A bat credit card? Bat nipples?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:20.352 --> 0:26:21.111]: 
  We'll get back credit.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:24.554 --> 0:26:26.950]: 
  Over that, did you say big lift crocodile?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:26.916 --> 0:26:35.944]: 
  No, so do you remember the movie? I think it's Fern Goley? Was it Fern Goley? It's a part where a big-lipped alligator walks out of the trees and starts singing and then leaves. He's like, it's a big-lipped alligator moment!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:29.211 --> 0:26:30.510]: 
  It was a fun goalie.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:33.599 --> 0:26:34.949]: 
  I think it's a big lip...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:35.944 --> 0:26:38.999]: 
  Chris, you know the cause if we say the fuck it's...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:38.999 --> 0:26:40.585]: 
  So you were about to say you were autistic. You were autistic.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:40.416 --> 0:26:41.952]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:41.997 --> 0:34:49.824]: 
  I changed the Glendale and it wasn't any better. It was like four stars out of five girls were hot, but they had sweaty butts. So I go in, we find this place, we go in, and the first thing was they don't have alcohol. Yeah, what? Yeah. Which I wasn't aware of. Wait, really? Well, I don't know if that's all West Coast, but Seattle was the same, it's dry bar. I mean, I went to a strip club in Missouri and they had alcohol. Well, wait, was there contact here? Yeah. See, so that's the thing is sometimes, if they have contact, then they don't have alcohol, and some other places they'll serve alcohol, but then there's like a no contact. All I saw was the star rating and the name. I didn't know if it was like all nude or not, but it was. Yeah. So we go in and then they're like, well, you know, like, would you, what drink would you like? I'm like, I don't want anything. It was like, yeah, yeah, oh yeah, it was water red bull and like, oh, duals, like not an alcoholic beer. So we both got a fucking water. We were sitting there lame assholes, just like sipping more water under these black lids. Your $10 water? V8, watching these triples. Oh my God. You were two like super white dudes, sipping water in an Armenian club, cool Jeff. So these girls came over and their first thing they're like, they're like, oh, it's been a while since we haven't seen like a not fat army. Like, there's like two, like, we used to like fat Armenians in here, something like that. Wow. She said that to us. And then she's like, she's like, you guys really shouldn't even be here. This is like better strip clubs down the street. But they rely. Wow. Oh my God. The money isn't even worth it though. So we're sitting there and then, and each one of them, like it immediately starts, like they're not really sweet talking us. They're immediately just our shit talking all the other girls. Like the one white girl, she's like, you see that bitch over there? She's so old. She's a little bitch. Whereas other strippers are fucking like. Yeah, that's fucked. Please. All their strippers. Like, and most of them are just sitting around and either smoking or listening to music. They're not even, nobody's on dancing on the fucking pole. That's hilarious. Nothing's even happening. We're sitting there like assholes. You know what's funny about this? This is like their own like our medium strip club drag racing version. They like call out to the ones. Nobody goes to them. So we're sitting there. They don't give a fuck. Sounds like an alien. Yeah, yeah.

He had tar because he's like, we were building like the lower foundation of like a house in the middle of like the woods, because he wanted to, he just bought like five acres and he wanted to build a house. So he was building the basement foundation and he needed like tar to hold certain things in place. So we had hot tar and we got tar on ourselves. We had it on our skin. But you know like- How did you get tar yourself?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:59.089 --> 0:43:59.950]: 
  Oh

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:03.494 --> 0:44:06.565]: 
  Hey son, go jump in that pile of mud.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:05.721 --> 0:44:07.004]: 
  Oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:06.565 --> 0:44:11.948]: 
  I don't know what the tangent was to get into this, but... Say it's far to a tar bubble or something. No, no, I don't know what it was.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:11.948 --> 0:44:38.492]: 
  What did I say before this? I said you're building a stupid house in the woods. No, we're using water. I was talking about water pressure. Oh, yeah. So the water pressure is like the fucking the stomach when it explodes. It's like the same thing. That amount of pressure and air would blow your fucking face. Your skin of your face off. Yeah. Because when you're that close, it's like, that's where they have to fucking do this. Yeah. I don't know if it'll light a firecracker from a foot away. I don't think there'd be a shock wave of air pressure coming from a bullet. I think it's where the pressure comes from.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:12.201 --> 0:44:15.357]: 
  I said before this is building a stupid house in the woods

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:17.078 --> 0:44:19.069]: 
  Oh yeah. So the water pressure.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:22.596 --> 0:44:22.613]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:27.389 --> 0:44:27.979]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:30.713 --> 0:44:34.982]: 
  Yeah, I don't think they'd be like a shock

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:37.429 --> 0:44:39.505]: 
  I think it's where the pressure of the water is.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:38.492 --> 0:44:45.867]: 
  Uh, I know those intestines that shot across in that one video literally like smashed against a wall like 20 feet away. Maybe.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:39.269 --> 0:44:40.416]: 
  I don't know, that was interesting.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:42.154 --> 0:44:59.991]: 
  one video literally like smash the wall like maybe rub sure your face in your body if you weren't wearing a fucking but it made me think you got what is the worst what do you think some of the worst ways fucking died were like I just feel like it's just there's so many ridiculous things that could happen that that would be the end of you there is yes

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:45.445 --> 0:44:45.698]: 
  baby.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:49.208 --> 0:44:49.950]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:51.992 --> 0:44:53.140]: 
  Worst ways people see it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:59.991 --> 0:45:01.425]:

  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:01.324 --> 0:45:43.950]: 
  There's a similar idea, there's a similar idea, but I saw there's a video of a people were stuck in traffic and there's a tanker explosion Yeah, and then the explosion didn't get anywhere near the people and like waiting outside their cars But there was like some kind of heat wave that traveled out from the explosion Yeah, and hit everybody and what they didn't realize that he have immediately Destroyed like their layer their skin. Yeah, it was killed instantly But they didn't realize it so it like it felt like a like it felt like a probably good like a like a hug Like melted to their snow. No, no, it's like it's almost like it just penetrated their skin killed their skin cells After like a few hours of thinking you had a sunburn, but then their skin started sloughing off like it was good

 SPEAKER_04 [0:45:21.540 --> 0:45:21.945]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:21.945 --> 0:45:22.536]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:10.157 --> 0:55:11.153]: 
  What did they say?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:12.824 --> 0:55:14.207]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:38.558 --> 0:55:38.929]: 
  I don't get what you're saying.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:39.891 --> 0:55:39.992]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:39.992 --> 0:55:40.752]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:02.166 --> 0:56:06.824]: 
  They always do it to like shock you. It's like I know it's bad

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:05.541 --> 0:56:21.420]: 
  Sometimes it's a mixed bag they do it either to like bring aware to animal abuse Which is fucked up to say like you know what that existed already to like bring awareness to animal abuse or They try to make the video popular so more people see it and then those people get taken down

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:21.066 --> 0:56:24.441]: 
  See sometimes I think those two motives get mixed because I don't

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:23.918 --> 0:56:36.439]: 
  I don't follow artists. I'm gonna say the more popular The more rolling of animals and people. The more popular it is, the more I see it and therefore hopefully more people will be aware of the problem. Yeah, but I, but you know

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:25.251 --> 0:56:28.103]: 
  I understand. I'm gonna say the more popular

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:35.089 --> 0:56:39.004]: 
  Yeah, but like... But you know when their motives are to fucking just get...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:38.498 --> 0:57:01.617]: 
  Yeah, so when I follow artists who do that kind of stuff, great. Make a new account, post all the shit you want, and fucking warn people. I just, you know, I think it's really fucked up to be like, uh, posted to the timeline where, you know, like, all of your friends are now gonna see it. Yes. With that, like, you're doing that just for your own benefit. Yeah. Because you want attention. I've seen, I've s- that's popped up a few times, like, the animals getting their hats- What? Can I kill you? I don't fucking know.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:56:52.707 --> 0:56:52.943]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:52.943 --> 0:56:53.955]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:55.845 --> 0:56:56.993]: 
  Yeah. Because you want to.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:56.993 --> 0:56:57.381]: 
  I've

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:00.334 --> 0:57:52.394]: 
  Can I can I say it really fucking but it really fucking makes me really really angry really fucking irrationally mad When people were like there's a shooting that happens. There's a horrible thing and Everybody or the I don't know not even thoughts of person who's offering thoughts of person I don't care But it's on Twitter when it's like media influencers or like creators or youtubers have to say something and they don't say anything New or interesting they only say like so horrible to see what's going on. Yes hope things go well It's like dude you even if you are sad you are not tweeting that if I could remove 100% of your followers You were not a tweet of that. No, you're doing it for brownie points You do you're making a fucking horrible event about yourself if you're adding nothing if you let if you look if you're saying hey Donate blood here donate money here. It's different. Yeah, but you're literally saying so shocked to see what's happening at that Thing do you know? Yeah, you know why you know what your money or your mouth is no?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:11.370 --> 0:57:13.227]:

It tends to be the trending ones it tends to be the more popular ones and it's yeah, whatever it may be now I'm not saying you shouldn't be sympathetic obviously

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:52.140 --> 0:57:52.512]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:12.087 --> 0:58:14.905]: 
  It's the coolest. And it's, yeah, or whatever it may be.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:17.419 --> 0:58:46.950]: 
  I'm not saying anybody shouldn't feel bad. What I'm saying is when I see media influencers, when I see content creators fucking say something to the effect of almost randomly like so shock me to see what's going on It blank my heart goes out to you. What the fuck did you add? Nobody from that thing is seeing your tweet dude. You're doing to make it about yourself Yeah, and I know some people gonna fight me on that and say that's me being ridiculous But if you knew some of these fucking sociopaths to do it for themselves, they want to make it about themselves They want to know they want to let you know how sad they are

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:28.219 --> 0:58:28.979]: 
  with them.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:45.769 --> 0:58:46.157]: 
  Select them all if you don't see most tough cases coming

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:46.950 --> 0:58:53.076]: 
  What happens after is they're like so sorry for this and then they're talking about their new Gucci's Yeah, yeah, oh by the way

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:51.355 --> 0:59:02.948]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:02.948 --> 0:59:36.327]: 
  I typically do if like there's a really shitty thing that went on is I will try not to tweet that day You know I'll leave it yeah 24 hours because I know like if I said anything funny or and sometimes it's really fucked up like sometimes you like some event Happens and then like someone isn't aware of what's going on They're just tweeting silly stuff and people like fucking open up your eyes. Yeah a million people just died you fucking asshole You just like I was I was taking a shit. I didn't even realize this. Yeah, and that happens a lot I see that all the time of my Twitter feed and it's like sometimes you can't like you can't shoot the messenger look

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:09.749 --> 0:59:10.069]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:22.270 --> 0:59:22.371]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:22.371 --> 0:59:22.607]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:25.172 --> 0:59:25.442]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:25.679 --> 0:59:25.898]: 
  It's like

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:28.817 --> 0:59:29.054]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:36.074 --> 0:59:48.443]: 
  Look, I'm still adamant that it's going to read the news. I think you probably know what's going on, but like, I... Yeah, read the news. I fucking hate the news. Read the news, but... Because who wants to get your news from Twitter or something? You know what I mean? So if you read the news...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:41.170 --> 0:59:42.385]: 
  I fucking hate the news.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:46.317 --> 1:00:04.947]: 
  If you read the news anymore, you know who gets the news from Twitter they read articles the fucking news gets the news Yeah, it's true. Do you know how many fucking news articles quote Twitter as a source? Yeah, or how many times it is actually scary They use highlights and the only thing people read now in like news articles is the top of the headlines. Yeah

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:51.784 --> 0:59:54.383]: 
  It's true.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:03.867 --> 1:00:27.205]: 
  The headlines yeah, I yeah, but all I meant to say was like read the news fine. I think I still think it's a good thing It's depressing but read the news But when you tweet about the news or I know this first hand whenever you tweet about something you never feel better You never feel like you scratch the edge it always makes you feel worse I stopped tweeting about the news me too me too because the people that are agree that you're gonna keep a great view You're never gonna change who was mine. No, you know what's even more frustrating

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:20.944 --> 1:00:21.619]: 
  Yeah, me too.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:25.180 --> 1:00:28.437]: 
  No, you know what's even more frustrating is that whatever your point of view?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:27.205 --> 1:00:30.495]: 
  whatever your point of view may be or whatever information you may give

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:30.495 --> 1:00:37.971]: 
  Everyone's going to miss not everyone many people are going to misinterpret it Yeah, there are people who want to be antagonized or want to be

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:36.182 --> 1:00:42.257]: 
  Yeah, for every one tweet you put out you have to make three tweets like

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:40.097 --> 1:00:45.447]: 
  To explain. To explain it yet. That's not what you meant. Or, yeah. Obviously it's more as a-

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:41.498 --> 1:00:42.004]: 
  Really, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:43.911 --> 1:01:30.047]: 
  Obviously it's more than that. This is a request to all animators, all artists, the world is a device in place. Make stuff that everybody can enjoy. You'll feel better, trust me. Don't fucking inject politics. If you want to do that, do it. But I've really come to the conclusion, TV right now, no matter what show you're watching, left or right, everything is fucking politicized and it's gonna age. I'm calling it right now. It is gonna age. It already has. It already has. Every movie, TV show, most movies and TV shows that are coming out right now in the last two or three years are gonna age. Ten years ago, it came out in 2017. There's a bunch of Trump shit in it. Oh boy. It's gonna age fucking badly. Imagine if a bunch of 70s movies had a bunch of anti-Nixon shit in them. It'd be annoying.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:45.447 --> 1:00:47.117]: 
  This is a request

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:07.148 --> 1:01:08.937]: 
  It's so fucking bad. It already has.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:08.937 --> 1:01:10.557]: 
  Everybody likes TV.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:27.179 --> 1:01:32.494]: 
  If he are doing I'm just curious. Yeah, what are like some right wing shows? What do you mean?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:32.157 --> 1:01:35.245]: 
  Oh, what are the shows like right leading? Yeah, I just...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:34.553 --> 1:01:36.375]: 
  I don't really know any.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:35.937 --> 1:01:38.822]: 
  I'd say it's more like actors and people like...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:37.709 --> 1:02:48.955]: 
  Okay, two things about Twitter. You know what you were talking about? Tweeting out, not tweeting out shit when a big tragedy happens. Yeah, I'm pretty sure when that New Zealand mosque shooting happened I tweeted out something really stupid about farts or something I didn't know it happened and everyone's just like what the fuck is wrong with you? Yeah, nobody knows. I was like oh shit, and then I figured it out. You have to like either delete it and be like sorry No tragedy happened. Wow. You're apologizing for not knowing what's happening. Sorry about my fart tweet I didn't know people New Zealand got killed. That's another thing too You ever noticed that Twitter promoting their own moments only ever get like less than a hundred likes and they're embarrassing That's insanity like the biggest website in the world and their their main moments that they promote usually Has ever said oh Mind that everyone has it and no one fucking cares Here's Kylie Jenner is the richest fucking yeah, oh yeah, well she wore this crazy swimsuit Wow when something terrible happens I think there's an expectation from some people that that you should say something that you should have an opinion that you should Speak up or add your voice to the pool

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:53.993 --> 1:01:55.225]: 
  Yeah, nobody knows.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:56.760 --> 1:01:56.879]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:01:59.747 --> 1:02:00.642]: 
  Wow

 SPEAKER_04 [1:02:02.464 --> 1:02:03.156]: 
  Sorry about that.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:02:07.493 --> 1:02:08.539]: 
  Everything too.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:02:13.079 --> 1:02:14.445]: 
  And they're embarrassing and forgot.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:14.445 --> 1:02:15.154]: 
  sanity

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:19.002 --> 1:02:25.330]: 
  Nobody cares, nobody on earth has ever said, oh, let's check out Twitter moments. I wouldn't want to do a goody so fine.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:28.418 --> 1:02:28.452]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:30.645 --> 1:02:31.557]: 
  being made to part of...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:45.816 --> 1:03:10.943]: 
  or whatever stupid idiot I get it I get I get if the argument is like oh you have like five million Twitter followers You should help somehow if you really want to fucking do that. I am fine with that. That's fine But what I'm shitty on is the just making it about you like I'm sad well, so what dude people are dead right? And so what did a let's play all right? No, no, no, I'm trying to say I agree. I agree I agree

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:04.699 --> 1:03:05.155]: 
  And so

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:06.167 --> 1:03:06.505]: 
  Oh, great.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:03:06.505 --> 1:03:07.821]: 
  No, no, no, I'm trying to say that.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:07.821 --> 1:03:26.451]: 
  I agree, I agree, I agree, and what I would say is this, is that can we all just assume to some degree, and maybe it's a bad assumption, maybe I'm just way out on a limb, but can we all assume that if there are terrible tragedies happening that I'm not at home fucking giggling about it?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:10.943 --> 1:03:10.960]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:26.451 --> 1:03:28.493]: 
  But maybe I don't need...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:28.493 --> 1:03:31.446]: 
  to put out a tweet talking about

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:31.446 --> 1:03:40.305]: 
  particular thing because I don't think my tweet if we all are reading the news we all know what the fuck is going on we know the plot it's bad this shouldn't happen yeah shoulda you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:39.698 --> 1:04:22.240]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:29.834 --> 1:04:31.437]: 
  This girl

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:38.845 --> 1:04:40.448]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:20.138 --> 1:14:51.947]: 
  I was swinging the golf club and he just fell down on the balls. It sounds like they made a show. He just fell down in the cement. He was taking a nap. What's the fourth sewer death? The fourth one was basically, it was something Mick said, where this person was in a pool and it was warmed up, or maybe it was like a sauna, and he was just resting in it. And eventually, it became, because the more hot something is, the more relaxing it becomes. And he took the things that make you relax and get tired. Is it an axe? Yeah. And he basically cooked alive. So he was like, boiled?
