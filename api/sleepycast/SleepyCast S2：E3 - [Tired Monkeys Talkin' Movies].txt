  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:41.974 --> 0:04:01.962]: 
  I down and everyone died the most impressive thing about that is they seem like they always catch the person with a Infrared cameras chase him through the woods or they find him hiding under like a plastic pool I'm down they get him every time you know we're like fucking around with it It was a really foggy night like a week ago We were walking a wall in the dead of night and we were shining lasers the whole way so I was like no go stand like 500 feet over there and I did it and when I showed the laser at him to him the laser was like as thick as a head like it was Really big so really shine it. Yeah, if you shine it up in the sky It just gradually gets bigger and bigger. So yeah, if you hit the helicopter We'll just be completely red But only for like point zero zero one of a second because there's no way you'd be able to focus it on one point right that far Up in the sky for like more than that I want to know when we're gonna get to the point where lasers can do all those fancy things They can't do they can't lasers are already at that point where it can like it's where they can like chop off limbs Yeah, it can cut through like metal. They use it to carve. Why aren't we using those in war? They are right? You see the movie real genius. That's a good movie real genius. Yeah, it fell Kilmer. They built a laser Yeah, and and they're funding it and then I realize that it's a military project. Yes. Oh wow I've never seen that well it was 1984 Mick. It was you know before they copied 1984 so that was before he was a wife beating He's a wife beater. What are we talking about Val the wife beater Kilmer. How dare you talk about Iceman like that?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:52.572 --> 0:02:54.732]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:03.531 --> 0:05:29.982]: 
  He was ice man. He was cold as ice. So, uh, so he hit a few women, whatever, you know. They had it coming. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna forgive him for a few minutes. I'm surprised he didn't drop the line they probably deserved. That's the line. Look, he's fought lions and he's flown fighter jets. Come on now. So what? Tom Cruise has saved the universe and turned back time and all sorts of things. He's still a crazy person. They smack around a few ladies. They probably had it coming. What are you guys talking about? Movies, assholes, not cringe videos. I got a cringe point. Yeah, what's that? We were talking about cringe videos. We're watching cringe videos. On my mind, why have we created something in the same vein as like Johnny Five? You two are culturally shallow. Johnny Five. What's Johnny Five? Why haven't we invented that yet? It looks pretty fucking... Short circuit. Yeah, it's made from like toasters and the basic stuff around the house. I think they invented the short circuit. Dude, there's like robot battles, like battle arena where they've got robots with buzz songs dropping off. Yeah, well, Johnny Five had a heart. Those motherfuckers are programing. What is Johnny Five? Is this some shitty... Johnny Five is alive. What are you talking about? It's from short circuit. Short circuit. It's the robot. I saw that. I know. It's a good movie. No, it's not. It's a fucking baby movie. The sequel's epic though. He grew up. I guess he became the prototype for Pee Wee Herman. They just took up some fucking buried ass memory. No, Pee Wee. Oh yeah, he looks a lot like that Pee Wee Herman thing. The one that's like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:05.522 --> 0:04:05.725]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:09.809 --> 0:04:12.644]:

  Johnny 5. What's Johnny 5?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:55.590 --> 0:04:58.695]:

  I

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:14.995 --> 0:07:17.442]: 
  promos for the Joker. I feel like they just keep making work.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:16.497 --> 0:07:51.074]: 
  keep making worse and worse jokers like it just looks weird there's so many other villains that are way more interesting in the Batman world but the only thing people think about is now is Bane Joker and fucking the Riddler I guess is sort of like considered and the crow yeah Jim Carrey was a really good Riller he really brought that role to life because he played like a fun what you didn't like him you know what you might be right but it's hard to say because the movie itself is trash oh it's absolute trash okay all right I agree dude the whole thing with two faces laughably just painful everything is two faces not a good not a good

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:35.498 --> 0:07:37.135]:

  Everything

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:50.753 --> 0:07:52.997]: 
  Not a good idea and then they had like Drew Barrymore.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:52.997 --> 0:07:59.444]: 
  and that other like his whole house was half split with like it was all dark on one side and light on the other it was like so

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:58.448 --> 0:08:00.321]: 
  It was like so try hard.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:00.321 --> 0:08:36.687]: 
  Well, it's that dude that's fucking what's his name the dude who did the puppets in the ghost town? What's his name? He does like a bunch of like gothic shit all Tim Burton Tim Burton? Well, this was in Jim Burton Joel Schumacher Joel Schumacher. He didn't do for yeah He's the one who did he's the one who did the nipples and butts Yeah, that one. Yeah Batman Rob is amazing. Yeah, so many ways How did it get me guys the first couple minutes of that movie are smash zooms Crotches and they zoomed in on the codpiece and yeah, how the camera there. Yeah, I do think I do think it's a black comedy Because it's like kills the Batman series

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:08.117 --> 0:08:08.269]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:09.180 --> 0:08:13.720]: 
  That was in Tim Burton. That was Joe Schumacher. That was Joe Schumacher. He didn't do it forever. Yeah, he's the one.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:17.129 --> 0:08:20.385]: 
  Did he really do that one? Yeah. Batman and Robin is amazing.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:30.173 --> 0:08:30.460]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:37.597 --> 0:09:22.941]: 
  You can look at it like that. But I mean, the director apologized. He did! He did! That interview! He's like, guys, he was pretty much just like, look, comics are for babies. And I was just, I was trying to make it like a comic. I'm so sorry. I guess. I like the transition from Batman and Robin to like Batman begins. Yeah. It's like, get rid of the baby shit. Let's start over. Yeah. Because there's always like, you know, that the Dark Knight saga, this always bothered me. I always think like the Dark Knight with Heath Ledger was the first one, but it's not. It's the one where it's like, he's in like a fucking he's like in the snowy mountain shit. Yeah, Liam Neeson is the bad guy. That was boring. Yeah. I hate that one. But it's like, that's what started it. I thought it was good. I completely forgot about it. I liked it up to the part where he actually turned into Batman, and then I didn't like it. I feel like his portrayal of Batman has always been awkward. Yeah, what was with the list?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:38.712 --> 0:08:39.437]: 
  But I mean

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:49.984 --> 0:08:50.440]: 
  MBC 뉴스 이덕영입니다.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:50.440 --> 0:08:50.828]: 
  I like the

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:54.051 --> 0:08:54.692]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:57.409 --> 0:08:57.494]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:57.494 --> 0:08:57.882]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:09.002 --> 0:09:12.310]: 
  Yeah, Liam Neeson is the bad guy though. Yeah, I hate that one.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:13.525 --> 0:09:15.128]: 
  I completely forgot about it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:22.941 --> 0:09:24.932]: 
  No, I'm here to thank Gotham.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:23.852 --> 0:10:17.397]: 
  I thought they had taught them. It's such a shame they went with that. They should have just had them talk about it. Yeah, what was it? Like, what's the deal with Batman having this talk like he has throat cancer? I guess he just wanted to make his voice unrecognizable, but he couldn't do it in any less of a silly way. Fuck Batman Rises. Kiss my ass. It sucks. Actually, I think that's the most boring movie ever. I thought it was the guy that said they brought the Scarecrow in. Yeah, he was cool. What's his name? He's got a really weird name. Uh, can I make my... It's like, Clowey McDoodle? I don't know. I forgot. You know what I know? It's like 28 days later. It's a 28 days later guy. I love 28 days later. Did you guys see 28 weeks later? Yeah. Your average movie. Yeah, it was really fun. It turned a little sillier. And then what was it? 28 months later? It's just nonsense. No. They never did a third one. We'll see 28 centuries later. 20 centuries. Just like a dusty planet with nothing. The fucking monkey apes have like disintegrated and fell off.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:32.003 --> 0:09:33.404]: 
  I guess he just wanted to make his voice...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:40.137 --> 0:09:41.807]: 
  That really sucks.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:46.094 --> 0:09:46.701]: 
  Yeah, he was.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:50.447 --> 0:09:51.949]: 
  Mate, he's like...... charity...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:54.042 --> 0:09:55.442]: 
  You know what I know, it's like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:55.442 --> 0:09:55.459]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:02.547 --> 0:10:05.331]: 
  Yeah, it was really fun. It turned a little sillier.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:04.437 --> 0:10:04.994]: 
  That's all sillier.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:07.592 --> 0:10:09.938]: 
  No. They never did a third one. You see, 28 centuries ago.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:09.938 --> 0:10:10.292]: 
  later.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:17.397 --> 0:10:18.865]: 
  He acts as planet of the age.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:20.991 --> 0:11:20.374]: 
  The Apes disintegrated and fell off. What? They disintegrated and fell off the planet. Are they remaking all of the Planet of the Apes movies? No, they're rebooting a lot. They're bringing back the ideas, but they're making new movies. They haven't technically copied a plotline from any of the Planet of the Apes movies. They're referencing them a lot. They're all prequels in a way. Which one was the one that was hated by everybody? Oh, no, that was the one with Mark Wahlberg. Tim Burton directed that. It was the worst film ever. So the Tim Burton play was a remake of the original Planet of the Apes, but worse. Yeah, it was really bad. Did they have the line? Oh, it's damn dirty, shaggy. Get your hands off me, you damn dirty. It was like damn dirty human or something. Oh, that's right. That's right, they flipped it. He touches the Abraham Lincoln monkey statue, and then he goes to the cop. He's like, where am I? Just your damn hands off me. He's damn human. And they're riding banana cop cars.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:03.085 --> 0:12:03.962]: 
  brooding and walking

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:08.755 --> 0:13:42.985]: 
  I'm just messing with their fists like, WOAH! AHH! Dude, you hear that Tim Burton? You fucking idiot. Fucking idiot? Get your ideas together and lose it? Oh boy. Wait, I got a good idea. Okay, here's a good topic. Have you guys seen a picture of a baby who hasn't developed yet? Oh, uh, like you? They're talking about like a boarded fetus. Like when you hold a flashlight? No, like a fetus who hasn't been aborted yet. And when you hold a flashlight up to a pregnant woman's stomach. They look like baby mice. Almost all fetuses, like I've seen like baby koalas and stuff. They've got these big black bug eyes. They look like binding of eyes to characters. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And they're Harlequin babies. They're big black eyes like pierced through their tiny little eyelid membrane. Yeah, you can see it through the membrane of the eyes. You can also see all their little organs through their translucent skin. You can fit it in your mouth all at once. Listen, I don't shine flashlights through pregnant women's because I am courteous of their bodies. You guys think right, you know when there's babies inside women? Yeah. Not sexually, but pregnant women. Okay. So there's a baby inside a woman, right? Not sexually. You put a speaker up to her tummy, right? Yeah. You start blaring weird noises like... until the baby's born. Yeah. Well, the baby come out like completely like crazy. It'll probably kill it. It won't kill it. The reverb will blow into your drums out. Which one of you is going to be the first to have a child go? Wow. Cory. Really? Yeah. You think I would stoop to that level? Chris. Yeah, you're old. Yeah, Nick. Nick is old. Yeah, Nick. You're old. What the f... If I was going to have a kid, I would add it by now. You're pussy will shrivel up eventually. You're going to have a baby, Chris.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:29.815 --> 0:12:31.384]: 
  Like when you hold a flash, it's like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:38.590 --> 0:12:40.193]: 
  baby collars and stuff.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:44.496 --> 0:12:45.458]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:01.034 --> 0:13:01.236]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:03.885 --> 0:13:04.392]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:03.902 --> 0:13:04.004]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:06.400 --> 0:13:07.328]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:12.610 --> 0:13:12.981]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:18.263 --> 0:13:18.550]: 
  Yeah?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:18.297 --> 0:13:18.314]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:21.014 --> 0:13:21.351]: 
  And I'm from

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:28.405 --> 0:13:31.375]: 
  Cory. Oh, really? Yeah. You think I would stew?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:39.998 --> 0:13:40.217]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:44.385 --> 0:15:05.554]: 
  Alright, um, definitely me. Definitely you. Jeff will never have a kid. Cory will kill his child very quickly. By accident. I just figured you'd get like rage. You'd get like this rage and be like, shut up, shut up! And you'd shake it over and over. You're a bee attestee! I was at the zoo, this is a whole other topic, but I was at the zoo and they were talking about the pandas and why panda babies die so often. Because the mother just accidentally rolls over on them. Yeah. That's why they're going extinct. You can imagine Cory's watching this kid who rolls over to sleep and suffocates his child. Kids like screaming, butting around. Can you imagine? That's, I mean, that's really sad. I mean, you think about this as your child. Yeah. And then you're like, you know, you're trying to sleep with it or keep it warm and then you wake up in the morning, you don't hear it breathing. And then when you look in the mirror, you see this flat baby on your chest and you have to peel it off like a fucking fruit roll up. I'll be. And then it's dead. If I have some blink playing in my ear, there's no telling what happened. There's a really, really sad video on YouTube of a chimpanzee mother and her little baby chimpanzee and the baby chimpanzee died and is like rotting and stuff and the mother finds it and she's like, she's like grabbing it and putting it down and grabbing it and putting it down because she doesn't know what to do. And she just like holds it for like a day straight and then she's like, fuck this. She leaves it. Oh my God. It's the saddest shit ever. Chris, why did you watch poor mom finds dead children?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:48.014 --> 0:13:49.448]: 
  Definitely you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:52.502 --> 0:13:53.430]: 
  Bye, everybody.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:54.224 --> 0:13:54.865]: 
  I just

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:59.607 --> 0:14:02.155]: 
  No, it's just a beer!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:10.137 --> 0:14:12.449]: 
  Yeah. That's why they're going to get...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:17.275 --> 0:14:17.292]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:19.266 --> 0:14:20.987]: 
  Can you smell it?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:36.985 --> 0:14:38.200]: 
  And then it's dead.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:40.613 --> 0:14:41.457]: 
  There's a really really

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:59.985 --> 0:15:01.656]: 
  Oh my god. It's the saddest shit.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:09.756 --> 0:15:13.502]: 
  I didn't you Google said chimp mom holding dead

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:13.502 --> 0:15:24.657]: 
  I actually found it because it was linked to another video where a gazelle gets eaten by a baboon and that was the worst video ever That is the worst video ever every time the baboon like bites into the gazelle guys

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:18.970 --> 0:15:21.012]: 
  No, not that fucking video!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:25.467 --> 0:18:22.266]: 
  And you're like, oh my god! And the baboon just like looks around like, what the fuck is that? He's like, you're all, ahhh! It's like this gazelle screaming like a human, it's the worst. You show me another video too of this like mom who's cradling your kid and this like angry monkey dad comes up and grabs it and starts fucking slapping it. It drops it and fucking walks off and the mom picks it up again and then it's like nothing fucking happened. Yeah, monkeys are funny. No they're not! That's fucked up! You're like fucking terrifying. You said, Kory look at this video and it was like that and then the monkey kind of like crowds up to it and fucking looks at it and then he grabs it and fucking throws it and then walks off. I mean I wonder like every single time people talk about how you know we're so uncivilized compared to nature like, you know we're like these violent and twisted creatures. Granted yes, we do do fucked up shit for sure. But we do it with thought. Some people. One little monkey anecdote. I went to the San Diego Zoo recently and out of all the animals in the entire zoo like half of them were either sleeping or playing like games with each other or just looking around obliviously. But the only animal there that really disturbed me was the gorilla enclosure where they they're sitting there with like their backs up against the glass where the people were looking at them and they just had this demeanor about them. And they're like looking over their shoulder glancing at you every now and then and turning back. It's like they're like sitting there really passive aggressively and almost annoyed they're being watched. They felt like they were the most self aware thing in the zoo. Yeah, oh well that's because they are. They feel super threatened. And the woman there she's like do not look at them, do not look them in the eyes no matter what you do. Just avert your eyes. Yeah, gorillas are really they're just people except they don't. They really are. They're just like sad people sitting there. How would you feel if you were like this like hairy un fucking grown chimp or some hairy ungrown man. Just like some hairy man sitting there. You have this gross hair disease and you look at your shoulder all these fucking other monkeys are slapping the glass behind you. And you look back and like don't know what to think of it. The other monkeys there seemed like they were having a ball. They were just picking bugs up at each other's backs and didn't give a shit. Throwing it at people. Yeah, gorillas are not happy. Gorillas like they have like a territorial thing but other monkeys are just sort of the ponds and they have nothing to worry about. Wasn't there that video of those people who were tapping on the glass and the gorilla turns around like smashes the glass. I think a little girl is like beating her chest at the gorilla and the girl's like oh fuck you. He runs at her. He cracks the glass and they're all like oops no run away. I would be bolted too. There was the Irish zoo Dublin Zoo had a gorilla enclosure that was like fucking 20 feet by 20 feet. Oh god. It was so depressing. I don't know if they've changed it but. There was a bunch. A bunch? It was like a vertical like enclosure but it was like so small and all the gorillas were obviously depressed and wanted to kill themselves. I remember the last time I went to a zoo it was so hot and cute.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:54.120 --> 0:15:55.032]: 
  CAR renting

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:03.250 --> 0:16:04.144]: 
  This is the next one.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:18.488 --> 0:16:19.703]: 
  some people.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:56.018 --> 0:16:58.178]: 
  Yeah, that's because they are.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:05.535 --> 0:17:06.227]: 
  your eyes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:09.518 --> 0:17:10.362]: 
  They really are.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:12.099 --> 0:17:13.095]: 
  That's exactly it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:19.339 --> 0:17:19.406]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:19.406 --> 0:17:21.162]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:21.854 --> 0:17:22.343]: 
  You have.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:23.625 --> 0:17:26.123]: 
  and all these fucking

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:36.906 --> 0:17:37.615]: 
  throwing in a piece of paper.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:38.374 --> 0:17:39.792]: 
  The drill is not happy.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:45.040 --> 0:17:45.141]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:49.495 --> 0:17:49.664]: 
  I think

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:53.275 --> 0:17:55.097]: 
  Fuck you!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:57.291 --> 0:17:57.679]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:05.982 --> 0:18:07.062]: 
  Oh God.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:09.492 --> 0:18:09.947]: 
  was in there.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:23.397 --> 0:19:01.990]: 
  I remember, I was there with that. That was terrible. The thoughtful look on your face when you said that. Yeah, I wonder if you could teach, like, if you taught a gorilla sign language. Would they ever tell you, please kill me? Like, I'm so miserable here. Please end my life. There's that one really crazy gorilla, Coco. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And she looks really depressed. Didn't she die? No, she's still kicking it. She's still going strong. Oh, is that the sign language monkey? Yeah. She's really smart. She met Robin Williams, and she was like, tickle me. And he was like, oh, OK. And he's like feeling her titties by accident. And she's like, oh, really? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:24.494 --> 0:18:26.924]: 
  That was terrible.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:35.513 --> 0:18:36.458]: 
  Like, do this.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:36.897 --> 0:18:36.914]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:49.131 --> 0:18:49.502]: 
  Oh, is it?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:51.342 --> 0:18:53.130]: 
  She's really smart.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:56.539 --> 0:18:56.894]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:05.314 --> 0:19:05.601]: 
  And

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:05.601 --> 0:19:31.521]: 
  Feel their titties maxin' it. Oops! You know, probably the happiest animals there are probably the fucking cheetahs because they stick them with like a dog pal. Oh yeah! The dog is calm, the cheetah is calm. That's kinda how they, yeah. They raise them as babies. I thought they were food initially. No, they're all sitting there, this cheetah's lying there and this dog is just sitting there next to him like, like it's nothing. They're like best friends, they buddy them up actually. That's a good idea. But that cheetah in closure to the zoo wasn't very big.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:17.565 --> 0:19:19.506]: 
  That's how they, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:19.506 --> 0:19:21.075]: 
  It was food initially.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:26.054 --> 0:19:26.391]: 
  They're like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:27.437 --> 0:19:34.947]: 
  That's a good idea. But that cheetah enclosure at the zoo wasn't very big. Really? Yeah, it's not big at all. Oh, I heard something weird about cheetahs. Like, they...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:34.947 --> 0:19:41.950]: 
  They don't like to run or something? Oh, they run under high legs like a human if they're really hungry. Hahaha.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:41.950 --> 0:19:46.439]: 
  Come on. That's my shirt. That's a bag, huh? That's true.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:43.317 --> 0:19:45.139]: 
 太早了

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:46.439 --> 0:20:20.391]: 
  They really can't run twice as fast on T-Lan. There's a video of it on YouTube. Oh yeah, they're probably- It's fucking jogging. The person in his suit with his fucking other head. You had that black outline around him. I remember you said that Brannosaurus is worth like 30,000 feet tall. I'm not listening to you ever again, but anyway. I really thought that was real. I really did. What's a dinosaur? Those big long neck dinosaurs. I saw an internet article that was like, they discovered a new dinosaur that's like so big its head was like engulfed by clouds. And I was like, holy fuck, I told Jeff about it. He's like, Chris, you're an idiot.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:47.991 --> 0:19:50.134]: 
  I can't run twice as fast on two laps.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:56.479 --> 0:19:58.319]: 
  So you have the body plastic

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:05.035 --> 0:20:05.693]: 
  I really

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:22.365 --> 0:20:44.759]: 
  It's like cruising speed like there's a 37. It's like he can do a little dot up in the air. You're like you're so stupid if he was that big his bones would break under his own weight. I was like how the heck was I supposed to know? The T-rex invited his neck and fucking crunched and had his fucking big chest. No, no, no, I drew his size comparison. He was so big that like his foot was bigger than a T-rex. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:27.175 --> 0:20:29.065]: 
  You're a liar. That's all they are.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:38.363 --> 0:20:38.380]:

  thousand feet tall.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:50.344 --> 0:20:53.939]: 
  I did T-Rex would be like a mosquito. Yeah, I just wasn't thinking.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:52.757 --> 0:22:44.959]: 
  Yeah, I just wasn't thinking I don't know why I believe it well Maybe that was like the first part of the brawn and then they because you know animals over time they get smaller they do scientifically Understand the scale what we're talking about here. This isn't like this isn't like even like the size of a skyscraper This is like yeah, we're big times as tight of a skyscraper. Yeah, I wasn't thinking Plains are flying. Yeah, I wasn't thinking I was like I was like that's it sounds gargagy when I agree I didn't have any idea of the measurements of feet back then I didn't I'm sorry cuz I mean to pick on you No, it's completely justified But I will say that the probably is a big huge dinosaur out there in the universe You think there's just floating around It's gonna bonk is noggin I think there probably is like prehistoric like dinosaurs that are still at the bottom of the ocean Yeah Have a minute because they're still like like see show me pictures of these like Fishes that are at the bottom of the water. Oh, yeah It's just these like you know they have to be that big in order to sustain the pressure Some of them look like they have fucking human faces on them. What? Yes, I'm not fucking joking.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:19.103 --> 0:26:20.605]: 
  There's fire

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:22.191 --> 0:26:59.940]: 
  You're such a fucking psycho. What about, Chris? What about you? Well, you're fucking... You were a great potato farm? I wanna hear about your hometown. Fuck! I wanna hear about your hometown. Well, the hometown of Wexford we got, the famous Wexford Creamery that makes lovely milk. Yeah? We got the Hook Lighthouse where many ships were smashed into the side of the cliff because it didn't do its job. Thank goodness. No, but I don't even know, no, that's a lie. Uh, we got, um, Johnstown Castle, where a famous Lord Oliver Cromwell hid in this castle for many years because he was horribly disfigured in a fire. People were like, don't go near him, and then when the people finally found him, he had shot himself in the brain.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:28.806 --> 0:26:30.848]: 
  I want to hear about your hometown.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:00.767 --> 0:27:04.429]: 
  Wow. That's specifically in his brain. We haven't heard from him.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:03.214 --> 0:27:08.665]: 
  We haven't heard from that freak in a couple of weeks. We should go check on him. That's all. He's got some water. That's all.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:06.944 --> 0:27:40.305]: 
  That's true, he's got some water. A huge line. He's got some water. Is it a beauty of the beast? I don't know what else there is in Wex. We got the Rocklins. We got... We got the Grey Skies in a couple of years. We got the Premier, which they make good fish and ship. Do you have famous Wex from Poutine? Poutine. Poutine. Everyone drinks this. All anyone does in Ireland is so probably Yann. Jeff, what about you? What about you? What about... It was kind of just a depressing suburb. It's grown up a lot over the past few years, but there's lots of cows and horses and grass. That's not monumental.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:12.344 --> 0:27:13.677]: 
  I don't know what else

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:16.410 --> 0:27:16.512]: 
  But

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:28.493 --> 0:27:29.117]: 
  Dzień dobry.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:38.567 --> 0:27:39.023]: 
  That's right.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:40.086 --> 0:27:43.005]: 
  You know, when I brought up this subject, I was kind of hoping there was like a murder

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:41.537 --> 0:27:41.959]: 
  I'm gonna hold it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:43.005 --> 0:27:50.245]: 
  Or there was a murder there was a murder. Okay, okay, we're getting some way there's an ice cream shop near

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:43.866 --> 0:27:45.334]: 
  There was a murder.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:48.777 --> 0:27:52.354]: 
  You didn't ask me that. I love how you just skip- You're like, there was a murder that-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:52.354 --> 0:28:19.439]: 
  There was a murder, there was also an ice cream shop. There was a shotgun murder at an ice cream shop. Oh really? Holy shit. Oh I didn't tell you about the murder that happened at a ice cream shop. Yeah you did, you said there was some freak up at the top of the tower. Yeah but that was a huge shock. I know it was a guy called Oliver Cromwell but I don't know what happened. I completely forgot the story. I didn't tell you the murder of 94 and where I come from. Tell us about the murder of 94. You can come back to me. Corey tell us about the murder. I'll tell you something. Fuck that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:56.370 --> 0:27:57.248]: 
  Oh, really?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:01.855 --> 0:28:03.947]: 
  Yeah, but that was a huge one.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:03.947 --> 0:28:05.449]: 
  I know it was a

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:07.930 --> 0:28:08.402]: 
  I didn't tell you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:12.807 --> 0:28:13.634]: 
  of 1994.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:14.494 --> 0:28:17.481]: 
  Cory tell us about the murder

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:15.996 --> 0:28:16.452]: 
  For the mother.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:20.535 --> 0:29:33.503]: 
  What happened? There was no... I was... Hahahaha There was... There was a murder... It's the facetious, not all towns carry murder stories. Alright, Jeff's talking about murder stories. I need to hear this before I go to bed. It's not really a murder story, but somebody died. Okay. It's fucked up. Basically, get how unlucky this guy was. In this town near where I grew up, there was a fire... There was a firehouse at like a T intersection. You go through the intersection, the firehouse is on the other side. Basically, this is like a dump truck filled with hot pavement material. Yeah. It was coming down the hill to the T intersection. Its brakes failed, and it plowed into a car, and pushed it all the way back into the back of the firehouse. It pushed the car into the firehouse. Yeah, the dude was dead, probably on hit, but... Right. It burned down the firehouse, and nobody even knew this car was in the back, and pretty much the truck driver lived it like, of course he did, but it took a while. Finally got the fire out, and they pulled the truck out, and they realized... He finally realized there was this fucking car pushed into the back of the burned down firehouse. Dear God. So that guy got fucking mad. How close to your house was that? Five minutes. What noise did he make five minutes away? Yeah, what do you sound like? What noise did he do? He probably died instantly. Oh no! Anyways, that was... I always wonder what the last thought through my head is gonna be. I've had dreams where...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:23.708 --> 0:28:24.450]: 
  It was the

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:28.500 --> 0:28:30.458]: 
  I need to hear this.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:59.415 --> 0:29:00.276]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:59.432 --> 0:29:00.428]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:24.897 --> 0:29:25.437]: 
  It's bright enough.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:28.694 --> 0:29:29.925]: 
  Anyways, that was...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:33.503 --> 0:29:40.962]: 
  where I got shot and killed and the last thing that goes through my head almost always is aww fuck. And then that's what's gonna be like.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:39.291 --> 0:29:39.949]: 
  I know that's what's going on.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:39.443 --> 0:30:47.601]: 
  And then that's what's gonna make me like, gosh, darn it. Yeah, God damn it. What would you guys do if a solar flare happened and all electronics in the world just stopped working? I'd go to a liquor store. No, I'd go to a gun shop and loot it. Then I'd use those. You would not. You would not go to a gun store and loot it. Then I'd use those guns to go to a liquor store and loot that. No, because it would all be guns. Then I would go to a Costco with my guns and liquor, and I would barricade myself in there with a few people that I trusted. What about the other 1,000 other people who thought the same thing? Yeah, you'd be getting it. I personally, I don't know what I'd do. I would shoot them with my guns. I would start a business and hire all let's players for blow-up metal language, because they'd have no skill set. That's a good idea. No, you don't understand. You could start a new movement that way. The world would be rioting. There would be no order. There would be no electronics. There would be no internet, cell phones. That's right. You tell me. So I'm saying guns. We still have fucking, we still have batteries and outlets. No, because every bit of electronic microchip explodes in the solar flare. OK, have you seen small soldiers? Yes. Well, fucking put your electronics underneath a dish.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:43.358 --> 0:29:44.151]: 
  What would you get?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:00.554 --> 0:30:00.570]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:01.853 --> 0:30:02.309]: 
  Then

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:02.309 --> 0:30:02.730]: 
  I would go.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:08.451 --> 0:30:09.447]: 
  with a few people.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:15.994 --> 0:30:18.441]: 
  I would shoot them with my gun.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:22.457 --> 0:30:22.845]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:31.266 --> 0:30:33.915]: 
  That's right. That's what I'm saying. Guns.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:48.951 --> 0:30:55.937]: 
  They had a convenient huge dish in their garden. I don't even know why. I'd be able to protect all my electronics and my

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:55.937 --> 0:30:57.186]: 
  My big lead.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:57.186 --> 0:32:38.132]: 
  Yeah, house. Just get rubber. It doesn't even matter. If you're like, Rubbers of metal. Rubbers of metal. Fine. Rubbers of metal walls. The fucking power stations that allow you to use them or not. Uh, not my bicycle powered electrical generator. What would you do? You wouldn't be able to call your parents or your friends? Let off another solar flare. I'd be like, listen, I'm an artist and they'd be like, show me your work and nobody would believe me. They'd be like, we don't need our right now. We need fucking people who can do some hard labor. It's true. Hey, Chris, if there was a solar flare and all electronics got knocked out and you weren't able to see your parents would you go on a magical adventure of harrowing feats to cross the sea to get back to Ireland to see your parents? Absolutely not. They would never see you again. They would never see me again. Because that would be fucking ridiculous. I'd get back to Ireland and the country would be completely... Everybody would be rioting and killing each other. Why? Because parents would be dead. I thought Ireland didn't have any electronics to begin with. Y'all fucking eating potatoes and living in grass huts. Good one! That was a funny joke! I take your place, Chris. I go there and live like a Highlander. You would go back, you would get instantly killed by... Wrong! Wrong....the seas. I'd behead everybody. Not take their power. I would be extremely upset that I couldn't contact my beloved parents, but they would understand that going back to Ireland would be a huge risk. Your dad's candy shopping it. Fucked. He's going to save all the chocolate bars. What's going to happen to your candy shop when the solar flare goes off all over the world with a chocolate bag? No, my dad, he owns a warehouse. He'll save all the dairy money. Could a solar flare technically blow up and take out all electricity around the world? It does. It's all chocolate, all electricity. All chocolate will be rendered useless. All Dragon Balls reaction figures will explode in your head. Oh no.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:58.452 --> 0:30:58.722]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:59.464 --> 0:31:02.299]: 
  It doesn't even matter if you're like trying to get fine.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:11.901 --> 0:31:13.504]: 
  Let off another silver.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:16.491 --> 0:31:18.482]: 
  They'd be like we don't need our right now. We

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:21.486 --> 0:31:23.241]: 
  Hey Chris, if there was...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:33.906 --> 0:31:34.581]: 
  to see your very

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:37.163 --> 0:31:37.517]: 
  They would

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:38.496 --> 0:31:38.530]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:47.372 --> 0:31:48.992]: 
  The parents would be dead.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:48.992 --> 0:31:49.954]: 
  I thought Ireland didn't have that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:03.218 --> 0:32:03.944]: 
  O que é isso?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:05.361 --> 0:32:07.842]: 
  Take their power.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:21.375 --> 0:32:25.071]: 
  He's like, he's the chocolate guy. No, my dad, he owns a warehouse.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:30.522 --> 0:32:30.960]: 
  They teach it at all.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:32.580 --> 0:32:32.817]: 
  Oh

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:39.027 --> 0:32:47.937]: 
  All of your stupid shit on your desk will go on fire, Jeff. Your stupid flux capacitor. Your stupid airpux that you don't read. Fuck you, Chris. Your shitty ass McIntosh.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:47.937 --> 0:32:50.147]: 
  The one benefit though, we all

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:49.995 --> 0:33:05.436]: 
  They all get superpowers. No fucking Mac would survive. Mac would survive. They'd have a fucking built-in battery. There'd be a solar flare coming towards everything. Chris would stay on something like a fucking retard, like doing like this Goku, like fireball thing at the sun, like I could stop it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:53.556 --> 0:32:53.910]: 
  Later.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:54.653 --> 0:32:55.514]: 
  It's in battery.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:01.268 --> 0:33:01.943]: 
  I think it's

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:04.997 --> 0:33:18.447]: 
  Facing the flare with his hands up in the air. It looks like a fireball. And he's all like, uh, yes, this is my soul. Comey, comey, come on. It's real. It's killed by the sun. Your face would be melting off. I would, I would honestly. The flesh would just right off your skull.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:07.478 --> 0:33:09.300]: 
  It looks like a fireball.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:12.743 --> 0:34:41.539]: 
  It's real melting off I would do that I would line my hand up to the Like somebody your face would have like a perfect hand shadow. Yeah, I'd be like crystal clear guys I'm doing it and fucking explode you have the silhouette of hands around your burn all over your face I have burns you'd have fourth-degree burns from the solar flare your eyeballs will be melted into your brain What's a solar flare does the sun explode? Basically like when the Sun like farts really hard Yeah, it doesn't explode it sends this big arc of like radiation and radiation flies to the earth and burns everything Has that ever happened it happened in like 18 like 90 or something? Yeah, I guess it's an EMP essentially So it would knock out everything basically and couldn't you bring it back? Yeah, like over like a hundred years It would take time to read you to bring back I believe they have ways of protecting electronics I think if you there is all that is one of those things if you turn the electronics off does it make it? No, it'll still fry it. I think yeah I remember he reading something about this where they said they there's precautions they can turn off batteries too, right? Like car batteries can't start either. Yeah sister electric again It's like in war the world's a Tom Cruise The only car that worked though. What the fuck was that shit? He fixed it because he was a mechanic. They said that the batteries out of the car like they just I don't know I like that movie. It was good. Yeah, it was cute. I like the way they died. I like it was like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:18.447 --> 0:33:19.004]: 
  I would

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:19.004 --> 0:33:20.084]:

There's nothing supporting. They're gonna die anyways Yeah, they're like they're dying slowly, but they call family members like yeah You got like I don't know you're like half an hour and you're dead, so or you can just die now We could pull the train car away, and you just died instantly So it's really just happen to you if you're like walking along a subway And you just trip and fall yeah, and then you're just like human how are you walking on the sidewalk and somebody fucking drives Their car to you because they're looking at Twitter I swear to God that almost happened to Zach once where we were at a convention And there was a train coming and like it was a train in the middle of the road like like a tram And he was just standing in front of it not paying attention and I was like Zach Zach I just grabbed and pulled them and I just missed them by like this much. He would have died I wanted to go fuck dude. Yeah, I have a question. Okay, what? Do you ever think you'd ever find your mutant powers at some point like the X-Men? What is your mutant power Corey? I don't know yet. You have to discover. What do you like it to be if you had one? I feel like you're setting yourself up disappointment. Let's just say we all had a mutant power guys Let's just say we had an innate hidden It's like deep within us, and it'll happen at any point during our life, right? Yeah, to sit there and speculate what you would want it to be is a surefire way to fuck yourself Because you'd get the power that would be nearly as cool as the one you wanted I want the power to write my name in cursive and not mess it up. I still can't do it I still can't do it right? Writing the entire alphabet in cursive? This isn't fiction. This isn't this is real life we're talking about Jeff. I understand. I get two-thirds of my name and I forget how to draw this. J-E I can't do it. What are you Corey? What would your power be? What would you want it to be? Corey would turn to like rock or something I feel like it would be some kind of or metal. Corey would turn into like cotton and slide under the door. Cotton? Corey would be like the cotton man. He'd like float away in the air when he gets lonely. Like you throw a little flex of himself in your face you inhale it and cough. Corey would like hide in like chairs and let people sit on them. Chris would just like turn to a chocolate bar. I've already found my mutant power. What is it? What is it Chris? I lost all sensitivity in my penis because of your cough.

What? We can find autismos by the truckloads. You can. You want garbage? We got it from Giles. You're like Aquaman for autismos? That's all I need. You like send out a call like Sonar and then they just all flock to you. In your mind you hear like the new Thonak on the ground is awful and you hear it and then you look it up and then suddenly you find it. Can you call out to them like, autismos? They're like echoes throughout the sky and then they all come in like buses and their parents drive them to the office to like hang out with you. No, no, it's not like that. It's like a technological like sense. Like for instance when I first find out about like Chris Chan it was, they didn't know about it but then after I found out about Chris Chan I realized like it was just so easy to find people. Yeah. It was easy. Yeah. There wasn't a word to look up like cringe at the time. It took real talent. Corey, Corey, tell me the story of Rocky Six. I heard you have an interesting summary of this. I've never seen it. Me and Chris discussed it. We were saying if you were telling it to somebody who never saw it. I have not seen it. Okay.

It's a clock dude People got to get to work. Otherwise they commit suicide, right? So when people are driving during like heavy rush hour bums would lie out like there's a red light You just saunter off in front of the cars lie down. So in order to fucking get them to move They just throw like hook change at their faces. It is fucked up people

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:31.922 --> 0:50:33.846]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:13.249 --> 0:51:48.923]: 
  Get out of your car. It's illegal to kick someone in the face. You're like, hi, I'll hit you, I'll hit you. They're not people anymore. They're speed bumps. Exactly. Is there like suicide Nazi stuff in Japan, or is that China? No, that's Japan. When I went to high school in Japan, around the times that the results of their examinations would come out, but all of our parents got faxed and saying, your kids are gonna come home late from school. Don't be surprised. And it was because there were so many fucking suicides. And we'd back up all the trains. Wait, really? Yeah, absolutely. It's absolutely a fact. Why are people so depressed there? Well, in Japan, you go to school. It's a lot like China.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:22.514 --> 0:51:22.919]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:25.990 --> 0:51:26.007]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:48.923 --> 0:51:54.441]: 
  it too, but you go to school like before school and then you go to school after school and all this is to study for this

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:54.441 --> 0:53:12.505]: 
  one exam and this one exam is the thing that basically determines whether or not you're gonna have a life and if you fail this test Then it's like a possible get a job They like put like a big dunce hat on you and you got to like sit in the corner of your room making miniatures of your own room Doesn't everybody that's like people just every country has that big exam. That's what people get it. Yeah, but it's like okay Then I run on a draw porn They just make fucking hentai well not everyone has that attitude like I can go make my pave my own porn filled way There's some pretty fucking, you know, do the SAT a little here. We've got the leaving cert Which is really hard leaving start leaving sir. You're like certification. Yeah, it's like you're supposed to try and achieve 600 points and if you get below like 300 means that you're not gonna get a very good job and like that's it like after that you're done I mean you take it again. No, like I know lots of people who got really shitty results They still got jobs, but I don't know I think that whole cuz they pretty faces probably Like how that how it's like determined by like one factor like one test is just like fucking horseshit Yeah, what if that year you were just like completely out of it You know if you subscribe to that mentality and I did when I was young because I was conditioned to believe that was all there was You know, it was like paint by numbers step by step a bcd you go to elementary schools

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:11.907 --> 0:52:13.004]: 
  That's what people get into.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:13.004 --> 0:52:17.037]: 
  But it's like okay, then I run on a drop or

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:23.010 --> 0:52:23.888]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:26.099 --> 0:52:27.415]:

  Because they have pretty faces.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:58.937 --> 0:53:01.637]: 
  shit yeah what if that year you were just like completely

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:12.505 --> 0:53:20.335]: 
  You go to, you know, fucking middle school, then high school, you go to college, you get your college degree, you do an internship.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:20.335 --> 0:53:30.359]: 
  get a job, get the house, get the spouse, get the dog, have the kids, ABC all the way through. But I think if you subscribe to the idea, like if you're sitting there like wow,

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:30.359 --> 0:53:34.999]: 
  this test is determining my life, you're already kind of fucking yourself. You know, like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:34.999 --> 0:53:37.632]: 
  You should just stand up. That's what everyone tells you though.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:37.547 --> 0:53:38.931]: 
  It is what everyone tells you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:38.661 --> 0:55:43.367]: 
  Fucked up and the worst part is a lot of the subjects like don't matter No, like I really I wish there was a subject that taught you how to live because when I left school I had no fucking idea where to begin I had no idea how to pay taxes how to fucking We're talking about saying this is like something you should learn in school before you get out of like fucking like taxes should be the main thing Yeah, you should they should teach you tax. You know why they can't teach you to handle credit Taxes because every year they revise that book and there's thousands of fucking pages That's why people who have CP like even if you have a degree in it You're still gonna generally have like someone that you hire Yeah, do your taxes because it's so complicated. All they gotta do is just teach you the very basics of it Like just how to do it. Yeah, they don't even do that Don't teach you how to write a check. I might as well be wearing a fucking dunce hat I like right now. I have to look up how to write a check every month I forget how to do it and then the next month. I'll like I'll have to just do it against it because I've already forgotten Yeah, it's weird. It's weird. They don't even cover that stuff and all these checks are like different to it Like the TD bank check is different from all other checks. Whatever checks are gonna be a thing in the past The way we pay taxes which should be a thing in the past like oh absolutely Oh, that's why a lot of people like when it comes to like politics, you know But when they run on platforms some of them talk about like doing like a flat tax That's where it's just like it's so much less complicated But just be like everything should be more expensive or something or you should be able to like do it online much easier You know like like every state has their own taxes Nickland timing every little thing you ever do is fucking obnoxious It's like just give me the extra ten dollars or whatever It's so funny too because it's like it's a little game. It's a little meta game like my accountant He sort of does my taxes because he feels bad for me like does my parents taxes But you know he he almost gets like hard-on from it's from like the excitement of finding loopholes in tax code Yeah creative accounting. Yeah, they call it. Yeah, I got an account to use really cool That's what we say but for all you know the

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:44.247 --> 0:53:44.702]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:54.102 --> 0:53:54.996]: 
  until this one we're talking about.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:59.215 --> 0:53:59.940]: 
  Taxes should be the...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:02.303 --> 0:54:04.615]: 
  You know why they can't cheat you, Jackson? They can't...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:18.469 --> 0:54:20.309]: 
  Because it's so complicated.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:25.422 --> 0:54:28.527]: 
  I don't need, I'm a, I'm a Don't teach you how to write a check I might as well

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:29.809 --> 0:54:31.463]: 
  I have to look up

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:33.319 --> 0:54:35.260]: 
  It's confusing, man. I forget how to do it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:45.587 --> 0:54:45.959]: 
  whatever

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:47.849 --> 0:54:49.536]: 
  You don't even have to worry about it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:49.536 --> 0:54:50.481]: 
  one of you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:53.822 --> 0:54:54.531]: 
  Oh, absolutely.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:01.889 --> 0:55:03.087]: 
  It's not like that.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:11.423 --> 0:55:14.342]: 
  Like, like, Nick man, I mean every...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:34.980 --> 0:55:35.369]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:36.786 --> 0:55:38.170]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:41.376 --> 0:55:45.865]: 
  Yeah, that's what we say, but for all you know, they're fucking raping you. You don't know. I don't give a shit.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:44.464 --> 0:56:01.322]: 
  I don't give a shit man. I would not care. I just give him money and be like clear it. He's my dad's kind of too. Do what I can't do. Smart guy. That's like when I bring, if I had a car and I make crash, I'd be like, can you fix this? And be like, yes it costs you $1000 but alright, we'll make it work.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:50.033 --> 0:55:52.733]: 
  He's my dad's kind of too. My dad's nobody.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:53.813 --> 0:55:55.787]: 
  Yeah, that's like when I break if I had a

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:02.993 --> 0:56:45.450]: 
  You know, Karafe's fucking you. He'd just be hitting with a hammer and he'd be like, this isn't wrong. I'd be like, well, if I put the ignition in and it doesn't turn on, I'm not paying you. Yeah. Like, would it be possible just to make everything more expensive? Would that not work? Well, a lot of places have like, they have certain taxes for goods. There's also taxes that cities pay. Like, you have to pay city tax in New York. Like, there's tax for everything, guys. I mean, honestly, they're- No, I understand that, but there's like extra taxes Like, if the country just made everything- Just take the money out of what I have. I don't care, fucking- You know, like with inheritance, the inheritance taxes that are there? Like, a third of whatever you have left is-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:03.297 --> 0:56:03.398]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:04.444 --> 0:56:05.457]: 
  He's just been hitting with a hammer.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:23.834 --> 0:56:24.255]: 
  drinks

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:27.698 --> 0:56:28.002]: 
  like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:28.002 --> 0:56:28.643]: 
  May they smell your

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:32.997 --> 0:56:34.718]: 
  Like if the country just made everything.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:38.667 --> 0:56:38.785]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:38.785 --> 0:56:39.561]: 
  You know like within here.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:44.944 --> 0:56:46.497]: 
  is all that's left.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:46.345 --> 0:56:56.942]: 
  So like let's say you have like three million dollars right? You die and you want to pass that on to somebody, they get a million dollars. Two million dollars, guess where that goes? The fucking government, wherever. What? Yeah, they just take it and throw it into a big fucking hole.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:56.942 --> 0:57:15.437]: 
  hole, which is called the debt. Like they just literally just shovel money into it. So every time you hear about a president or whatever, Congress, and they're like, yeah, we just approved $3 trillion for this, you know, we budgeted this thing for whatever. I mean, that money comes from somewhere, and it comes from us.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:15.437 --> 0:57:26.136]: 
  Which is why, you know, people talk about, like, why voting is important. Because these people are just gonna... You know, they make these decisions and they're just like, Oh yeah, by the way, we just spent billions of dollars on...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:26.136 --> 0:57:34.979]: 
  this fucking thing that you may or may not even care about. Welcome. Yeah, you're welcome and we'll be sending you a check in the mail. Basically, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:33.494 --> 0:57:53.710]: 
  Yeah, is it not like possible though just to make like every product to like cost 15% more like every single little thing Some places have sales tax have higher sale tax in other places But like I mean like we're just removed the need to just sit down at the end of every year for fucking a week straight and fucking Get all that bullshit together that would make sense except for I do believe that they can

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:50.807 --> 0:57:51.499]: 
  That would make sense.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:53.710 --> 0:57:58.941]: 
  keep that system around in order to keep it ambiguous. Not only that, but it's also a work of art.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:58.941 --> 0:58:11.496]: 
  workforce. There's whole armies of people training just to be able to sort through that bullshit and figure out taxes. That's ridiculous. In fact, there's a whole thing, I believe, constitutionally.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:07.682 --> 0:58:07.699]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:11.496 --> 0:58:23.545]: 
  Any person who can tie their shoes and check their email should be able to figure out their taxes There's no reason why it should be as complicated as it is. Yeah, exactly But they keep it complicated they keep it fuzzy and you know

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:19.748 --> 0:58:20.457]: 
  Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:23.545 --> 0:58:29.940]: 
  what they love to do this is the other really fucked up thing that the IRS does when they flag you when they notice that you're fucking up they won't

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:29.940 --> 0:58:40.994]: 
  tell you right away. They'll let you accumulate fines and fees and they'll knock on your door when the number is just nice and exorbitant and then they're like oh by the way you're like dude why didn't you fuck with me?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:40.994 --> 0:58:50.967]: 
  tell me the moment there was a problem. If you did, I would have paid you guys. Yeah. But they loved his lead at Fester and Grow. I know a friend of my family, actually, he got audited and they sent him to jail for a year. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:44.183 --> 0:58:44.942]: 
  Yeah.

Sorry, what were you saying, Jeff? The propeller blades, dude. Oh, this is in the side way, but with the zoo, the most alien creature we saw was these fucking flamingos. Yeah, they're really weird. Have you ever seen them up close? Yeah, they're super weird. They were asleep on one leg and their eyes are scary and their necks are like a noodle. But how do these things survive? I don't know. Have you seen the way they walk towards them? They seem like they should have just been walking themselves out. You know why? They taste like shit, so no other animals ate them so they continued to live. I think they breed really fast too. You know that is a natural defense of certain animals tasting like shit? I think they breed really fast too. They're the only animal that has, they're in two exhibits, in two separate places in the zoo. I feel like they just, they multiplied so much. They just had to put them all in two different spots. I guess they fuck a lot. I guess they're really weird at that. Fucking flamingos. They're dumb for wearing animals. That's why they're fucking front yard watermelons. They're fascinating. Because they're fucking stupid otherwise. It's like, they just look so fragile. They just look so fragile. What about if gnomes were real? They do the same thing. Gnomes. They would stand on one leg. Would you talk to a gnome if it came to your house? A gnome. If he said, no, Corey, can I hang out here? Like, can I live on your property? I won't bother you. But it's probably true. You're talking about something like fucking midget-ass, like a garden gnome?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:51.285 --> 1:18:59.909]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:18:59.909 --> 1:19:05.005]: 
  such a hard turn like you go it feels very jerky like you get whiplash

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:05.005 --> 1:19:10.945]: 
  from it right? Apparently not that many years ago when it went up it came

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:10.945 --> 1:19:14.505]: 
  up and when it did the turn, it derailed.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:14.505 --> 1:19:17.442]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:17.442 --> 1:19:23.365]: 
  launched them like a hundred feet in the air and they landed in I forgot what they

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:23.365 --> 1:20:04.135]:
