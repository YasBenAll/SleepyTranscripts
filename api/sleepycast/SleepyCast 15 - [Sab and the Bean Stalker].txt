 SPEAKER_04 [0:09:18.621 --> 0:09:49.941]: 
  And so like the summer goes on and this happens like I kid you not like every maybe on the hour like every hour Oh my god It I found out it was like it stems from like her thoughts and stuff like that So if she works herself up and she thinks about negative things It'll actually like send her into this like she called them stress attacks, right? so It eventually like I found out way later that this was like a form of a seizure like you know the petite mall grand mall Seizure. Yeah, yeah, petite mall is almost controllable. Well, they can still like stand up and whatever On the ground, yes

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:25.050 --> 0:09:26.029]:

  She had both, like she would have both.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:09:55.560 --> 0:10:23.691]:

Start the fucking series. You're so free, daddy. And just I made sure that she would be distracted. Because you could actually distract her when she was mid-stress attack. And you'd say something funny. Like, stop. No. And I would say something that made her crack up, which was so stupid. And I hated doing this because it was so dumb. Oh, that's not a joke. But I was like, OK, what's your main thing? Do you know what you're doing?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:02.159 --> 0:10:06.445]:

She said, I got fat old turd coming through the pipe, like, that's what she said. That is what she said. I like to cut this thing, like, she's the true dals. She said she looked up her leg and did like a big ol' green fart. You were twisting my words, sir. I'm twisting your turds. Move on. Move on. Oh, sir.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:21.437 --> 0:11:21.623]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:43.864 --> 0:11:47.492]: 
  It's alright, it just hit me right at the corner, that's where- I think it would hurt, I'm sorry.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:46.952 --> 0:11:52.352]: 
  I'm sorry. The Bobilo, it raised Chris. Okay, Bobilo. So crazy Bobima.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:11:50.378 --> 0:12:07.590]: 
  So crazy, Bulbina. So you'd have to say something funny to snap her out of these like stress attacks, right? So the one thing I'd do is I'd make like an intercom voice as if she was like out of school and she was being called to the principal's office and I'd be like, Bulbina to the office please, Bulbina. And she would just crack up and stop doing the shaking and stuff. So I was like, oh my god this works, okay.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:50.547 --> 0:11:51.897]: 
  Bobilo so crazy bobeam

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:55.305 --> 0:11:55.677]: 
  Right, so.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:07.067 --> 0:12:08.822]: 
  Sounds like an attention seeker to me.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:12:08.822 --> 0:12:44.969]: 
  Okay, so you're on a roll already and I wasn't I was too hot so today so so like the whole literally the whole summer goes on There's one day at some point where I had to just basically walk her around the building because all the kids were on one side I had to go watch the kids, but she's kind of you know dragging her feet and stuff She had eight stress attacks each like two minutes long each just to walk around one building like the size of this house And every stress attack it was just like you have to wait Try and say something funny snap out of it, and it was just never ending right so Just if you can imagine like the levels of stress

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:11.944 --> 0:12:14.054]: 
  I wasn't, I wasn't this far.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:30.692 --> 0:12:31.215]: 
  walk around.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:44.850 --> 0:13:34.294]: 
  You know what this is? Do you know what you basically are doing? What? It was something I learned in psychology in college. Yeah. Basically doing, it's what they do for animals. Like animal pea sized brains. Yeah, you're conditioning them for the future. So you ring a bell if an animal to eat. So you ring a bell. Pavlov's dog. Yeah, exactly. You ring a bell. Basically, the guy I told you. Yeah, so basically Pavlov's dog is every, this fucking old asshole would ring a bell every time he feed his dog. So this dog would ring a bell every time the food was there. The dog's mouth would water even when he would ring the bell. There's no food. So it's not associated to bell with food. Right, right. You basically did that to Pellebina. The attention that I was giving her was just kind of like feeding it. You're treating her like a dog. You're feeding your dog. It's definitely kind of feeding into the cycle of... What's it called? I wouldn't say it's Pavlov's dog. But I would say it's kind of... You're Pavlov dogging Pellebina.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:03.514 --> 0:13:04.425]: 
  You ring a bell.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:17.875 --> 0:13:19.309]: 
  Yeah, yeah. I'm associated with the bell with food.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:17.993 --> 0:13:18.516]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:19.309 --> 0:13:19.950]: 
  Right, right.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:19.950 --> 0:13:25.941]: 
  You basically did that to Lilbina. You're treating her like a dog. You're feeding her like a dog.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:35.492 --> 0:13:53.346]: 
  You should just change your name to a third time coin. It's a Bulbis before a Burial. You came up with the name. Why did you say Bulbina? What does that mean? He said Bulbina with what you said earlier. He said she had a big nose Bulbaspray. Oh, Bulbis. Okay. He keeps saying big nose Bulbaspray. He keeps saying over and over. He keeps whispering to himself. Okay, come on.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:38.682 --> 0:13:39.441]: 
  You came up with...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:42.040 --> 0:13:42.107]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:46.191 --> 0:13:47.372]: 
  Oh, it's okay.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:51.372 --> 0:14:07.167]: 
  So, the actual part where it turned into almost like a stalker kind of scenario. How far in is this? This is towards the end of the summer and she's realizing that this little camp thing is going to end at the end of the summer and she's going to lose her best friend essentially. This is in her mind, right?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:57.329 --> 0:13:59.168]: 
  How far in is this?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:03.471 --> 0:14:04.534]: 
  and she's gonna like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:06.104 --> 0:14:08.652]: 
  This is in her mind, right? She advanced the converges.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:09.057 --> 0:14:13.174]: 
  it got so much worse, it was like to the point where like there was, I didn't even like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:10.305 --> 0:14:10.980]: 
  It was like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:13.140 --> 0:14:15.014]: 
  You couldn't even leave your side.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:15.014 --> 0:14:48.290]: 
  Yeah, and I was calling my bosses and stuff being like, what do I do? I need someone else here to help me, right? Because there's so many kids. And so essentially what she did is her caller ID at home, she found the number that I used to call her mom that one day way back. So misery shit. And so she had my personal cell phone number. And from there, I guess she got even more of my information by asking around the kids at the playground because I used to babysit some of them too way back. And so she got my email address, my phone number, those two big ones for Facebook. You can get everything from an email address.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:31.365 --> 0:14:32.310]: 
  and so she had...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:31.939 --> 0:14:32.007]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:39.179 --> 0:14:39.449]: 
  eye

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:39.449 --> 0:14:39.989]: 
  because I used to be.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:46.452 --> 0:14:50.890]: 
  Yeah, everything from your address and so the kind of worms have been opened

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:49.067 --> 0:14:49.455]: 
  And so

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:50.738 --> 0:15:12.389]: 
  Yeah, exactly. So I get I start getting text messages being like hi, Sabrina every day every every freaking day And so I'm just you know, I'm kind of like ignoring them for the first little while like this is you know We're not like best pals, right? I reply all the time and it got to a point where she would start saying things like my friends Threatened and beat me up yesterday, and I'd be like oh my god. Are you okay?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:01.150 --> 0:15:02.044]: 
  It's a pass.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:02.044 --> 0:15:03.107]: 
  Pals, right?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:10.920 --> 0:15:11.123]: 
  Like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:11.123 --> 0:15:14.549]: 
  I'm just gonna try to elicit a reaction from you. Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:15:13.435 --> 0:16:21.694]: 
  Yeah, yeah, and so she would say these like ridiculous things that I would always take seriously So I'm like you are you okay? You need to call the cops, right? And and so like sometimes they like she would actually like call my house and like she even got my parents number Come to think of it so she was calling like my personal like my parents number at the time when I lived with them and So it like I get phone calls from her I get text messages I get emails like everything she just like would overload the social media with just just herself, right? And so she she ended up saying that there are these two bullies that like founder at a mall and they like Be the crap out of her and I was like you need to report this to the police and she was like no, it's okay And I'm like no, I'm serious. This is not okay, so She starts like building this this like these scenarios and stuff saying that like this this person's gonna put me in a Grave quote-unquote like facade she showed me pictures that like these supposed bullies had drawn and I was just like Losing my mind like this is not okay. You can't pick on a person like this Yeah, and and so like I got way too involved for like the job that I was doing like I fell into a trap Yeah, exactly. It was like all part of like this weird little like plan, right?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:29.500 --> 0:15:29.939]: 
  Yes, thanks for theift Gambit mail!

  You fell into her trap pretty well.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:21.694 --> 0:16:29.389]: 
  Listen, maybe she went there completely aware that she's not actually convulging. She's making a new friend.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:26.925 --> 0:16:26.959]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:27.111 --> 0:16:27.600]:

  Of course you're being us detectives.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:43.800 --> 0:17:31.118]: 
  Listen, I'll tell you what. Chloe's magnified, let's do a fire, is it? Hold on. This is burning. This might be on fire. No, no, no. I would be like this. I'd be like, put this to Mr. Smithins. Smithins. You worry? Was that a fucking Sherlock reference that you were trying to remember? Yes. You fucking... Were you trying to say Watson? Yes. Smithins. Ah, I see where they're... I saw the gears in your head. You were like, okay. Smithins. Smithins, don't give a fuck. What are you talking about? You thought I smithered from such a thing. I fucking love you, Corey. Anyway, keep going. Wait, I didn't finish by... Go, go, go. By a Sherlock Holmes scenario. Go for it. About Smithins, yeah? Fire. Corey, you got to go back to the place before I... It wasn't about fire. He said fire. Corey, hold on.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:50.483 --> 0:16:51.563]: 
  I would be like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:04.657 --> 0:17:07.949]: 
  You fucking... We trying to say Watson? Yes, Smithens.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:06.818 --> 0:17:08.944]: 
  Yes, Smithens. I see where they're...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:27.490 --> 0:17:28.688]: 
  It wasn't about fire.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:31.118 --> 0:17:32.974]: 
  Magnifying glass holographic

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:32.755 --> 0:17:42.070]: 
  Fire is created when kinetic energy moves very fast. Coral! Coral! Coral! Coral's side sky. Oh it's pretty good. It's pretty good to continue. It's pretty good to continue.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:17:42.070 --> 0:17:56.009]: 
  Alright, so it's a fast forward a little bit more, like at the time I'm working two jobs. But I'm losing my fucking mind. So the day would end and I'd go to my other job and it would be like the end of every day I'd have to peel her off me because she'd always want to hug goodbye. Yeah. And it got like really, really, really complicated.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:45.884 --> 0:17:45.900]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:45.900 --> 0:17:48.702]: 
  I'm losing my fucking mind.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:53.714 --> 0:17:53.798]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:54.895 --> 0:17:55.502]: 
  We will.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:54.996 --> 0:17:57.224]: 
  Wait, wait, wait, why were you going back and meeting her?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:17:57.224 --> 0:18:02.455]: 
  No, no, it's not the playground. Oh, this is a back. Oh, so you're still going back? She had to go there. She was so she was emailing you and

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:58.304 --> 0:18:04.767]: 
  Oh, this is back. Oh, you're so come on. She was so she was emailing you and calling you yeah, and during that

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:01.324 --> 0:18:01.493]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:18:03.265 --> 0:18:42.314]: 
  Yeah, and she was going to the park every day. So it was like, I never got a break from her, right? And like, you know, I felt really bad for like this whole scenario that she's in, right? Because like her mom obviously doesn't give a shit about her, right? And so, like I kind of know the situation at home too. And it seems like nobody really pays attention to her at all. So like it makes sense that she's doing this at the time I had no idea. But anyway, I go to my other job and at some point, I guess, I don't know how she found this out, but she found out where my other job was and she would just show up and wait at the counter and just sit there. And she did this thing where she'd be looking in one direction away, but she'd be looking at you out of the corner of her eye. Like I'm moving her head around.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:08.277 --> 0:18:09.036]: 
  It's gonna be...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:09.914 --> 0:18:10.859]: 
  I felt really bad

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:12.951 --> 0:18:13.980]: 
  Dwight<|ht|>

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:15.094 --> 0:18:16.174]: 
  I don't know how to read it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:41.790 --> 0:18:45.857]: 
  So her head would be torn to maybe to the left, but she would still be looking at her eyes.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:18:44.490 --> 0:19:12.587]: 
  Yeah, yeah, she'd be looking at you like this, like a little sideways kind of. Holy. She'd make a funny noise like, hmm. Sometimes, yeah. And like, so, yeah. It's like an Abraham Lincoln penny. And yeah, like it just, and sometimes she would pretend she was in pain kind of thing. So you'd make sure it was okay. So you'd have to go over to, yeah. Yeah, yeah, you could just avoid it. And like, even there's even times where like, I'm sure she threw herself off of her bike onto the grass. And like, it wouldn't be like, she's on obvious pain. It would be like, ow.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:47.393 --> 0:18:48.979]: 
  Holy, you make a funny noise, like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:52.692 --> 0:18:54.548]: 
  It's like an Abraham Lincoln penny.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:59.357 --> 0:19:03.593]: 
  Yeah. So you have to go over to an ear. Yeah, yeah. So you could just avoid it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:12.587 --> 0:19:16.030]: 
  She fall down and she do the Abraham Lincoln Face Teeth.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:14.325 --> 0:19:23.674]: 
  Say out. And it's like you're clearly okay, I'm not going over there. Anyway, so she started showing up to my other job too, so it was like I could not get away from this person. I like how she's like.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:17.616 --> 0:19:17.937]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:22.290 --> 0:19:48.345]: 
  I like how she's like, like, sneakily. Not even sneakily! It's not that subtle. This is like walking in with a fucking newspaper with two holes in front of me, like, just looking at the news. She's fucking staring directly at you. It's a binoculars poke through. Yeah. So is it usually a second job while you're still doing the thing or thing? It's just like awful. But so this is all still going on. Oh, this is overlapping the phone calls, the emails. This is an amazing story about it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:26.070 --> 0:19:28.787]: 
  الف, no! This is like, this is Thing!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:34.997 --> 0:19:35.267]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:46.810 --> 0:19:51.602]: 
  This is an amazing story about it. It seems like literally, as soon as she goes home, she gets to work on those emails.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:51.366 --> 0:19:57.441]: 
  So what was your state of mind at this point? You're like, she's a girl who needs help, but she's obviously fucking nuts. Yeah, and it's clearly like out of the middle. Were you scared?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:54.437 --> 0:19:54.910]: 
  fucking nuts

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:54.910 --> 0:20:02.622]: 
  Yeah, it's clearly like out of place. Were you scared or? I wasn't ever like scared, no, she's not like violent or... Do you know what you should have done? Never.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:56.952 --> 0:19:57.829]: 
  or

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:00.411 --> 0:20:01.592]: 
  Do you know what you should have done?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:03.044 --> 0:20:17.607]: 
  Um, my friends, for their like crazy dog, they got this like electric fence. They got this electric fence where I'd run at it and would fucking, it would learn that it was electric. Look at how electrify her. Oh yeah, they're all electric collars. You'd be calling that a fence, Corey. Hold on. Let Corey finish.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:20:11.684 --> 0:20:12.899]: 
  That'll electrify her.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:18.518 --> 0:20:28.187]: 
  No, the fence was actually electric, so you couldn't touch it. So if you touched it, you get shocked. So the dog would learn like that, and a little like laser area.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:20:24.407 --> 0:20:24.846]: 
  So doggy.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:20:28.187 --> 0:20:29.200]: 
  This is what I'm gonna taser.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:29.655 --> 0:20:49.939]: 
  No, just set it up around your door. He's saying put her in electric fans and just keep her in there. Like a 5x5 fan. A 16x16 fan. Oh my god. Fill it with kibble and then let it watch that bitch ride. Put a fucking pig slap in there and hit it with sticks. Fuck it with a sunering ball of billiards.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:20:36.135 --> 0:20:39.814]: 
  Like live stock? A 16 by 16 fence.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:20:49.939 --> 0:21:56.072]: 
  Go out, it's okay, it's okay. So at my second job, not only am I working two jobs, I'm in school too, right? And this one day I'm in class and I get a phone call that I don't recognize and it's her mom and I'm like, hello, she's like, hi, this is my mom. She really messes you, she come over for a sleepover and I'm like, sorry, no, I'm okay, but thank you. And she invited me over for a freaking sleepover, like I'm a kid and of course, no, I'm okay. And she's like, well, she really messes you, so you should, you know, come over. I'm like, thanks, no, I'm okay. Like even at, I was doing a final in school one day and I got a phone call from her in the middle of this exam, like quiet, dead quiet room and my phone goes off. So that's like mortifying. Did you answer it? Yeah, hello, I didn't answer it. I just couldn't go through. I turned the phone off and my prom just looked at me like he wanted to kill me. So mortified. Anyway, so like you can imagine like every freaking five minutes you're getting something new from her. And on top of that too, she'd give me drawings and like things, she'd give me gifts of things, like certain things. And if you can imagine like what,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:04.755 --> 0:21:05.852]: 
  Paul bi-ners!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:29.798 --> 0:21:30.625]: 
  I love this sound.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:33.983 --> 0:21:35.198]: 
 绝吃的绝吃

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:36.987 --> 0:21:38.202]: 
  I just worry about that.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:21:56.697 --> 0:22:00.949]: 
  Go ahead, say it. Say it. Like a child would draw? Oh.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:57.102 --> 0:21:57.962]: 
  See it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:00.949 --> 0:22:01.995]: 
  No, no, like that.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:24:29.736 --> 0:24:49.362]: 
  That's the thing though, I actually sat her down and was like, okay look, this can't happen anymore and not even my boyfriend comes to work and sits this long waiting for me. So I don't want to be mean or anything but you can't wait for work at me. You can't wait for me at work like this anymore. And it was just, obviously, it didn't affect her at all. She didn't listen.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:38.494 --> 0:24:38.865]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:43.793 --> 0:24:44.451]:

  So they don't.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:24:50.526 --> 0:25:10.675]: 
  So fast forward even like further away when I'm working at a completely different job like this other summer job is over now and I don't even work at this the second job I was at which was like a Starbucks by the way. And so now I'm working for the city at this like front desk job and she finds me there too and like she knew what my car looked like so she like literally followed me.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:10.354 --> 0:25:12.953]: 
  tracking your license

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:12.227 --> 0:25:19.163]: 
  Probably your license plate or something? Probably, like it was ridiculous. Like I'd see her at the store, I'd see her like biking up and down the alley sometimes. I could hear the toilet.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:16.969 --> 0:25:20.395]: 
  Biking up an alley sometimes

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:20.159 --> 0:25:25.221]: 
  See, I had nightmares about stuff like this. Oh, god. I'd be like a sleep at night sometimes.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:22.200 --> 0:25:23.534]: 
  Oh, God.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:25.086 --> 0:25:28.242]: 
  She's be staring at the window having

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:27.651 --> 0:25:35.498]: 
  and I just, she has, she has this little, like, half-sleeping. You'd be asleep and you'd hear that. And I'd be like, Swim, swim, swim. Wait, you'd be asleep?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:28.984 --> 0:25:30.317]: 
  She has, she has a little.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:35.498 --> 0:25:36.207]: 
  and you'd hear that.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:36.207 --> 0:25:37.962]: 
  No, I swear to God.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:37.557 --> 0:25:44.020]: 
  Give me goosebumps. I'll get goose pimples. Yeah, did he stand up did she stand up to your house like it?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:38.772 --> 0:25:39.514]: 
  Like you can ask

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:43.919 --> 0:26:02.667]: 
  We were in an apartment right on the second floor, so it's about head level and like I swear to God She was like zeroing in on where I was because it was like right beside the park I was right there and like I don't have a feeling she never figured out exactly which apartment we were in but she Which window you're building? Yeah, she knew the building of some kind and like anyway, because she saw my car parked

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:57.284 --> 0:25:59.224]: 
  She found her like a building.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:02.616 --> 0:26:06.109]: 
  So you had a fear of her that she would be standing in the window these days.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:05.704 --> 0:26:15.509]: 
  I was always terrified to stand by my balcony and I didn't even put my bike out on the balcony because I know what that looked like and I was like, she can't, this is my only safe haven, you know what I'm like, she can't.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:09.467 --> 0:26:10.463]: 
  Oh my god.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:15.390 --> 0:26:19.440]: 
  If you were in America you'd probably be a god and kill it with it, but you live in Canada.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:19.154 --> 0:26:27.119]: 
  I looked into like restraining orders, peace bonds, I looked into like every possible thing I could do, not bone-ass. You know what you're saying? I'm not going to do any flaxin.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:23.474 --> 0:26:24.014]: 
  Borel.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:25.144 --> 0:26:46.947]: 
  You know what you should have? You should have. You should have. You should have hired two English guardsmen outside your door. They're kind of scarce in Canada though. What? They're kind of... Say those Canadian English guys. Yeah, the Canadian English, uh, Buckingham Palace World. The mountains? Yeah, Buckingham World and the mountains. Yeah, the Canadian ones. You could have fought... The mountains? Yeah, you could have hired the mountains.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:34.037 --> 0:26:37.311]: 
  They're kind of scarce in Canada though.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:41.226 --> 0:26:43.943]: 
  Yeah, fucking in the world of mountains. Yeah, the Canadian ones.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:43.943 --> 0:26:43.960]:

  I don't think we have Mounties in Edmonton

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:50.018 --> 0:26:55.671]: 
  They could have blasted her off her fucking moose. You're a pig all easy. Frozen winner she came from.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:53.140 --> 0:27:03.096]: 
  It's not easy. So, like in regards to that, right, like they refused to help me in any way because like there's no threat of violence, I'm not in danger and like there's no way I could convince anyone.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:02.640 --> 0:27:06.404]: 
  She's not technically violent.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:27:04.379 --> 0:27:56.944]: 
  Yeah, no, she didn't do anything. She was just following me around at all times And I'm like, okay this needs to stop and like no one would help me for like years not even my work And so eventually it started to be like she would come into work and she would have a seizure like almost every time and like Thankfully we have like lifeguards on the premise and stuff so they'd come and help her out and like of course I would always have to be the one going to help her out because like I knew like the history and stuff They're like springing out your friends here like you know go help her and it was it was so horrible Like the one day I remember so vividly she came in and like my the job that I work You're kind of like a captive audience right you're stuck behind a desk and you like you only have your little room You can't you can't leave the desk. Yeah, they if they want to stand at the desk and talk to you for hours They literally can so that's what she did and like she'd bring in a drawing almost every time like the same drawing and Same important

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:07.669 --> 0:27:08.091]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:26.367 --> 0:27:26.772]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:42.702 --> 0:27:43.579]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:54.818 --> 0:28:00.353]: 
  Same important time. And you have seizures. This is pretty much clockwork at this point.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:28:00.353 --> 0:28:09.972]: 
  I feel like, okay, this is stage two, season two time. Right? And so, yeah, so this would happen literally all the time to the point where the lifeguards couldn't even pay attention to the people.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:09.870 --> 0:28:12.790]: 
  Did people stop carry after a while? They did, and it was just like...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:28:11.710 --> 0:28:18.089]: 
  And it was just like, you know, you feel bad, but at the same time it's like this needs to stop like don't come here anymore

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:18.089 --> 0:28:22.004]: 
  She should be bullying you. Yeah, and so... That's bullshit from the start to finish.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:28:19.388 --> 0:28:20.789]: 
  Yeah, and so... That's bullshit.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:28:21.801 --> 0:28:52.817]:

Picture of me that I didn't give her She took a view from afar And then when you swiped it open so that the other background would show it was another picture of me I said, yeah a different one A different picture of you And they were both from the summer camp And they were both naked No no no Yes

  And that's why this stuff dragged out for so long. You want to give her whiplash for good. Seriously right, she has epileptic fits right? You know what you should have lasted in disguise. You should have run up to her and went, ah! You should have had a fit and died. You know what you should have did? You should have said her the fucking maze game. Because that was popular at the time. They're not real epileptic fits. And this one in 2011 or 2012. Oh the maze game. What the fuck are you talking about?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:42:51.994 --> 0:42:56.061]: 
  Okay, yeah, so we got to a point where on top of being bamboozled by Bolina

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:56.010 --> 0:42:58.862]: 
  Yeah, the worst kind of... That's the name of the podcast, by the way.

  That's the name of the podcast by the way. I'm boozled by Bulbina. Yeah. Anyway. Fuck. Okay. Sorry. Yeah, no. So on top of all this, I get to a point where I'm starting to realize, holy shit, those seizures that she had were all, there's no way those were all real. Maybe the stress attacks were plausible. But she was milking it. Oh, definitely. There'd be points where she's kind of... She knows that's how she gets attention. Yeah, you could see her stop and listen and then just carry it out even more and keep shaking and stuff. It's like, okay, no, you can't do that. Yeah. You know, that doesn't happen in the seizure. Anyway, yeah, it just carried on and on and on and like, eventually I moved away from the apartment and it was like the happiest day of my life because I was like, she doesn't know where I live anymore. I got a new cell phone number and I thought I was in the clear. Uh-oh. Operative word being thought. Yeah. And it like, it went on and on with like every comic con I went to, she was there in like in some new costume or just like wearing whatever.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:18.032 --> 0:43:20.580]:

  Did she slowly get to the right costumes like she would she didn't go? Did she finally feel what the fuck the conventions were for? That scream? Not of all the conventions? No, I didn't. Wait a minute, everyone's just like, Goku, I stand out in a huge black robe. Yeah, seeing someone just as scream, that's the fucking weirdest thing. That is something we like the retarded person would do. Yeah, that's only a retard. Oh, that's weird.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:10.615 --> 0:44:12.809]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:28.469 --> 0:44:50.625]:

Yeah, yeah, take her to episode 13 of Pokemon. Walk up behind your bloke fucking animal. That made all these little Chinese kids start, like, vibrating the ground. Bring a party of five over to her and start poppers all over her fucking face. Yeah, throw seven hops at her feet and scream, you're dying!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:33.497 --> 0:44:34.898]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:50.625 --> 0:45:41.622]: 
  You're dying! Another scary moment. These are horrible. I actually scared this part. But I was driving home one day and in order to get to the apartment that I used to live at, I'd have to kind of drive down an alley and then turn to the parking lot. And she would always take that alley and I'd see her sometimes and I'd just turn right around and go like another way. I would. And so like before I knew all this stuff about like taking advantage of your like attention and all that stuff. And before I knew that she was taking advantage of like, you know, milking the injuries that she supposedly had. She would actually keep like all these medical like, not instruments, but like she got like wrist wraps for when she heard her wrist at some point and crutches when she heard her ankle. And she kept all these things so she has like a collection of stuff to make people feel bad for her. And so anyway, she has a wheelchair too that she just kind of uses whenever she feels she can walk. Like I've seen her do all these like things that require you know.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:54.675 --> 0:44:54.945]: 
  Thank you.

Yeah, like, yeah, like I have- Yeah, picture a picture of like a dead quiet neighborhood. You have a slow-coded screamer. Yeah, like Steven Hawking roll out.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:05.230 --> 0:46:06.749]:

Well, I mean, it wasn't like foggy and like silent hilly or anything. But yeah, I'm driving up and I see this wheelchair and I have this brief thought in my mind like, Oh, what if that's called...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:51:08.440 --> 0:51:17.485]: 
  And like the more you guys say the more I'll like remember these weird extra little things that she did and it's like it's gone for so long It's like this like encyclopedia of crazy shit

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:12.827 --> 0:51:13.570]: 
  Go ahead.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:17.350 --> 0:51:20.202]: 
  This is like, this is some fucking novel, right? Shit.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:51:20.303 --> 0:52:24.192]: 
  The other, like the second worst Comic Con experience that she showed up at was like, and this is to the point where I'm aware of everything. I know of all the stuff that she's done and how she kinda uses attention. And I've notified security that, hey, this person may show up. Just keep an eye on her if something happens. Please help deal with it. Don't make me go deal with it. So anyway, exactly that happened and I predicted it to a T where I was like, you know, I had my boyfriend show up and he manned my booth for me when I just got out of there. So what happened is she essentially, there are some stairs nearby, right? So she walks up these stairs, she's got crutches, she's got like leg wraps, wrist wraps. As much as she possibly can't to like milk the appearance that she's injured. She's set up. Yeah, and so what she does is she walks up these stairs when she realizes I'm not there and she like turns around and literally throws herself down the stairs. She flies away. No, I'm serious. She threw herself down the stairs. I had a seizure at the bottom. And so the public starts gathering and they're like, oh my God, are we gonna help this girl? We need to get like, you know, a mess here. Your boyfriend saw this? I thought you were saying that she's free.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:30.867 --> 0:51:31.272]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:00.195 --> 0:52:02.052]: 
  She's set up.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:10.793 --> 0:52:11.924]: 
  W kinda goes wide away

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:20.682 --> 0:52:26.554]: 
  Your boyfriend saw this?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:52:25.997 --> 0:52:46.197]: 
  She threw down her crushes and fell down the stairs. Oh. Yeah, and so of course, you see someone with crushes fall down the stairs. You're going to go into superhero mode. Yeah, you laugh. They're okay, right? And so, yeah, she's doing this and she's like, you guys need to go get my friend Sabrina. She said, Sabrina, get out of me. So she's getting the general public, these strangers that I know.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:28.056 --> 0:52:28.613]:

She uses people to do her bidding. Yeah! You always have these perfect opportunities and you miss them. Like, you know, like, Con Con, you could have been like, Oh, fucking- two of the McGuire's at the front door. Everyone would run over her and trample her to death. Yeah, you could have done that. She's at the stairs. She's at the stairs? That's the hottest celebrity in fucking 2015. She's at the stairs. Don't be McGuire, fucking Spider-Man for 2002. She's at the stairs, right? He was also in Sea Biscuit. She's at the stairs. Fuck you! Yeah. You could have got- you could have got some perfectly long fish line, wrapped it around the escalator when she's coming up.
