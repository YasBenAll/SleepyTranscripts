 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:00.497 --> 0:00:23.177]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense. A world enveloped by a seemingly unending ocean of forests. Buried deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little cabin. And in that cabin...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:23.177 --> 0:00:33.049]: 
  Welcome to the Sleepy Copy Podcast. I'm Jeff Johnny-Tah, or whatever stupid internet name you want to call me. I'm hanging with Zachslash Psychic Pebbles.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:32.644 --> 0:00:33.724]: 
  You're going to bed.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:33.893 --> 0:00:50.059]: 
  Chris O'Neill slash Oni. Hey! I hate- I- What do you like, Oni or Wani? It's called me Chris the Fierce. Wani is a stupid name. I honestly never used to say Wani. And the infamous Cory slash Spaz Kid animator extraordinaire.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:41.672 --> 0:00:43.815]: 
  I have only Christopher Robin.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:50.920 --> 0:04:31.459]: 
  Chris. Yeah. Let's talk about the science of Dragon Ball Z. Oh shit. The science. The real stick science. Okay, so what do you want to know? How many gigawatts is a coming, coming, how many, uh, beam? Sixty trillion gigawatts. Yeah. Flux. Fuck the wire. Is it more or less still lightning bolts? It's actually sixteen flux waves if we're talking. Flux waves. Transformation. Is that real? Flux waves. I'm not gonna tell you how many times I've heard you say that. I'm serious. Shut up. Flux wave is the levels in which you measure the monkey abilities of the Dragon Ball Z. You are bullshit. The monkey abilities. It's true. The monkey abilities. The monkey abilities. The monkey abilities. The monkey abilities. 24,000 flux waves creates Super San 4 Goku. This is true. So say it. Create it by a quarter of a million. Say I have five monkeys. What can I do then? It's the level four. Is that cannon? If you put it up on a typewriter, you can make Mozart. What is the level four? Is level four an actual monkey? No, level four. Super San 4 is... What does he look like? He's a yellow ape, but he can transform into Red Goku, who is a tall Goku, but he still has eight monkeys. It's the same thing. He still has eight monkeys. He's Goku. He's Goku. It grows a V-neck in his chest. Exactly. I'm glad I brought this up. Red fur. Red ape. So what makes him transform into Red Goku from one wave? Flux waves. Flux waves. How about more flux waves? More flux waves makes you stronger. How do you get more flux waves? You gotta be strong. Is he still level four? Yes. If Vegeta uses flux waves to become level four and he comes together and makes Vegeta, you can create a level 10. Numbers in Dragon Ball Z don't matter. It's like every episode, it's like they matter to some people. And then the next episode, it's like, it's a million and one and it blows your mind. You're gonna hurt the cots. Deal with the level. What's the level? Wait, doesn't he lose his eyebrows and then they grow back again? It's true. Yes. Okay, I super say it through. He loses his eyebrows because it's scary. He looks like an antithole. Would you rather see a scary Neanderthal like Red Munchy? Would you rather see a nice buff man with black eye? No. I think on the Dragon Ball Z characters, they're level two, right? They're like, I'm really powerful, but I just want to kind of skip level three because I get really ugly. Oh, you're kind of hard. I'm gonna go back to level four. No, actually, they do. Once they reach level four, they no longer have to go through transformations of three. Some of them can actually just transform. So why can you just always go to four? You know, actually, they can transform into Neanderthal Goku like if they want. They don't have to go to. They don't call him. They don't call him that. Yes, they do. Super Saiyan 3 is officially Neanderthal Goku. Yeah, it's on speed two. Thumbs on speed? Yeah, kidding me. Yes, you can't for a speed two. He hits the trees and shoots fucking trees. Have you seen this, Jeff? I don't know. In episode 37, Goku has hands for speed, so it's grabbing people by the head. You know what, if you hear that, you better run in the direction because you're gonna get some feet legs. It's true. If they can surpass level three, then they don't have to worry about going level three or two. Is four the highest? Well, like I said, Vegeta can turn four and Goku can turn four. That new movie just came out. I love the Gods and they turn it to God Super Saiyans. Wait, is that five? Goku can now turn red. Officially red. Did he go red in the first episode? No, that's candy and the bounce. He's still red though. This is fucking bad. It's weird. It's like there's normal Goku and he becomes a Super Saiyan. Keio-ken, right? Then he becomes like a Super Super Saiyan or some shit. And he becomes Super Saiyan level two. Then level three and he has no eyebrows. Level four and he has eyebrows. And God, and he goes back to looking like normal Goku except for red hair. It's true. But I'm saying, isn't that... I believe you. Chris, isn't that exactly what the Keio-ken thing looks like? He's just hit with red hair. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:57.231 --> 0:00:59.273]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:46.463 --> 0:02:48.454]: 
  Would you rather see like a quesadilla?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:54.445 --> 0:02:56.689]: 
  Br Communhamos... zeros

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:05.397 --> 0:03:09.075]: 
  It's kind of hard. They're going to go back to level 4. They're going to go back to level 4. Well, actually, they do.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:17.412 --> 0:03:18.846]: 
  You know actually they can trust me

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:21.495 --> 0:03:28.077]: 
  They don't have to go to. They don't have to go to. They don't call it. They don't call it. Yes, they do. That is not...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:30.608 --> 0:03:32.970]: 
  Yes you can't for speaking. Yes you can.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:59.498 --> 0:03:59.515]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:01.135 --> 0:04:03.278]: 
  make sure i read officially written

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:05.759 --> 0:04:07.007]: 
  That's<|mi|> tortured now.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:07.007 --> 0:04:08.492]: 
  No, it's still red though.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:08.492 --> 0:04:09.842]: 
  It's fucking better.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:14.348 --> 0:04:14.939]: 
 可以了可以了

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:14.939 --> 0:04:15.462]: 
  Super.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:17.115 --> 0:04:17.654]: 
  There's a shit in here.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:20.490 --> 0:04:21.689]: 
  He has a bruise.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:25.637 --> 0:04:29.282]: 
  But I'm saying it's not... I believe you. Chris, isn't that exactly what the Kale Kandy...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:32.134 --> 0:05:10.947]: 
  But also, Frieza goes from looking like small Frieza into big Frieza into alien Frieza into small Frieza. I did watch some Dragon Ball Z in college. I love it. Also, like... I kinda get some of it. It's kinda weird too because like whenever Goku like made to the human, like suddenly the babies are a lot stronger. Does he do that a lot? Does he make them? Yeah. Yeah. Super come. What? It's always weird looking at the Japanese version of the show and he talks like this. Like, you have a... It's like, he's like, he's like an asshole. Yeah, it's like an old alien lady. It's like disturbing actually. I should have said that. When Goku comes, he's like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:38.867 --> 0:04:40.150]: 
  I did watch 7 Dragon Balls.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:45.735 --> 0:04:46.461]: 
  It's kind of weird.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:51.996 --> 0:04:52.957]: 
  I'm supposed to see you do that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:56.451 --> 0:04:57.379]: 
  Super cold.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:02.526 --> 0:05:03.015]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:04.720 --> 0:05:05.445]: 
  And now aw-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:05.445 --> 0:05:07.555]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:10.879 --> 0:05:13.495]: 
  Come on, come on, come on. Oh!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:13.495 --> 0:05:57.488]: 
  But I have a question. What's the thing they do when they like merge together? Fusion. Fuck. Fusion nash. Oh, the fusion nash. There's two fusion things. There's two. I was fusion my earrings, which you're not supposed to be able to come apart again when you go by your earrings. But there's rules around that because the series is kind of broken. But then there's also like fusing with fingers, which has a permanent amount of time. Are you impressed with Corey's knowledge? Corey, who would you fuse with? Any- That was real. With the earrings to be permanently fused with somebody. In real life. I'll fuse with real life. The other person doesn't have a choice. You just walk up to him and he's like, you're fucking gravel. You can't go to Goku Land and fucking through. You can't go to Goku Land. That's fake. Pick a real person you know. This is real life. It can be anyone of us or somebody we might know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:16.887 --> 0:05:20.802]: 
  There's two fusion things.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:25.071 --> 0:05:26.185]: 
  I don't know about you guys but...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:28.919 --> 0:05:29.037]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:31.214 --> 0:05:32.445]: 
  He tries to put me in it all the time.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:32.445 --> 0:05:32.699]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:37.238 --> 0:05:38.132]: 
  With the earrings.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:40.242 --> 0:05:40.950]: 
  in real life.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:41.929 --> 0:05:42.469]: 
  We did it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:43.178 --> 0:05:44.140]: 
  Yeah, you just, you walk...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:47.076 --> 0:05:48.443]: 
  You can't go Cusand.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:50.114 --> 0:05:50.974]: 
  This is real important.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:55.395 --> 0:05:55.463]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:58.821 --> 0:06:24.218]: 
  Who's Buck? Cory! You have to save the planet, Cory! I would get... I would get with the buffest person I know, Mick, Ricepire. Mick, Ricepire. Alright, alright. I would transform with Mick Ricepire, become SuperBald, and bald. SuperBald? SuperBald? SuperBald? SuperBald? You wouldn't just be bald, you'd be SuperBald. I'd be SuperBald. You're a dick with shrink too.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:04.980 --> 0:06:06.955]: 
  news of somebody now.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:16.506 --> 0:06:20.084]: 
  Super Bowl.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:25.011 --> 0:06:51.336]: 
  That's the smallest way you pay to have a... But hold on, Corey and Mick, if I had tiny dick, so maybe they would kick it. Negative times negative makes it positive. Of course they could be poking up into a stomach. Since my dick is huge and Mick has a small, I would have a medium one. Whoa. That makes sense, okay. Think about that. Who would you fuse with? Jeff, I don't know. Oh, Wilson? Yeah. Wait, who's the other guy in all the zone? You're a good spot. Yeah, I'd be the best one.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:25.079 --> 0:06:27.407]: 
  That's a small price to pay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:39.186 --> 0:06:40.570]: 
  It makes that make sense.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:51.420 --> 0:06:53.479]: 
  little fuckin dust

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:52.484 --> 0:07:04.094]:

  Niece Walker,crowdực

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:59.419 --> 0:07:00.449]: 
  Okay, that was a good one.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:00.449 --> 0:07:01.427]: 
  Nice.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:05.916 --> 0:08:02.987]: 
  with Carl Smitseya. Be the funniest guy in the world. Cool. You could walk around and fuck every bitch. You could bring back his career. He might, he might, uh... What do you say, Jeff? This better be good. Well, he does something that's really fat, but he's not even really that fat. He's like an heroin addict. He's like, you're a security. You're kind of thin, he's kind of fat, you just merge into like... Average-sized guy. You could make boring videos where you take a picture of your face and pop out and talk about wacky things and just... I don't really know what he does. Like, what do you call those things? He sucks for a job. Let's talk about something else. Okay. A lot of people, a lot of people ask every day, they ask us two questions. Why am I so gay? And that answers, I don't know, I just... What can I say? YouTube comments? No, my dad. Oh, okay. And the second big question is, how did you guys all meet? Oh, Zach. Zach, you start. Well, with who? I guess you, Jeff. All right, start, yes. How did you meet me?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:20.344 --> 0:07:21.492]: 
  He's like an heroin addict.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:21.492 --> 0:07:22.960]: 
  I say like you're skewed.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:25.272 --> 0:07:25.289]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:25.997 --> 0:07:26.622]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:41.944 --> 0:07:43.176]: 
  Every day they had

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:57.840 --> 0:08:00.692]: 
  I guess you Jeff.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:04.337 --> 0:08:58.658]: 
  I don't know actually, it's a bad way to start. I'll tell how I met Jeff. Yeah, tell it, yeah, say how you met Jeff. I walked into the New Grounds office and Jeff was working on his little Wacom Cintiq and I was really nice to him and he was really nice to me. But then when he left his desk, I went on his New Grounds account and I left a review on one of my cartoons and I gave myself a 10 out of 10 and made Jeff sound really gay. So I went back to Ireland and I'm not a gay. You didn't log out. I didn't log out of my account like a fool and Jeff made a front page post telling my mom and dad that I was gay. I think the picture feature was two guys pool splashing each other. I freaked out because my mom was like, my mom and dad are like, they do not want me to be gay. They don't hate gays but they do not want me to be gay. They don't accept their kids. But you took it in stride because you didn't even deny it. You're just like, you're right. You're right like, thank you. Remember to write down the comments I'm in. Did you acknowledge that?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:42.154 --> 0:08:42.914]: 
  yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:59.772 --> 0:09:08.226]: 
  I totally deserve it. Can you get me back or something? I think you got me back again after that. I don't know. I can't remember. I don't think so. I think you totally pooned me.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:08.226 --> 0:09:11.804]: 
  Wait. Now that is epic. Now that is epic, honey.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:09.981 --> 0:10:03.475]: 
  Now that is a big movie. If we're on the topic of how we met Jeff, I can tell about how I met Jeff. Yes, go ahead. On the sidelines I always looked at Jeff's cartoons. I felt kind of bad for saying what I did at the time because it's not true. Wait, what did you say? Yeah, hold on, bad dog. Sorry, good. Let me have it. Well, I guess essentially I made a joke where it's like the fact that all your cartoons were like 15 minutes long with two people talking and then the resolution joke was the guy walks away. Usually it was like the ending joke and it was just like, so I made a stab at that. But I guess the actual cartoon... I'm not an animator like you. Listen! Listen! What are you saying? Gory made a cartoon where you like fucked up. Yeah, I do say that. For Newgrounds, I guess my big introduction to meeting Jeff for when I didn't meet him in real life was I made a cartoon where him, Tom sucked off Jeff.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:24.679 --> 0:09:26.957]: 
  What did you say? 3D, hold on, I don't.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:27.615 --> 0:09:28.037]: 
  Like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:45.992 --> 0:09:48.186]: 
  Oh, what are you saying?

  What was this?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:09.499 --> 0:10:29.682]:

Oh, Corey can go. Yes, Corey. Wait, stampers stories? Yeah. Well, like how you met? How you met Stamper? Oh, I guess how I met Stamper was I released show and I had already liked this stuff. And I asked if you could voice in a really inappropriate cartoon I was working on, which wasn't showed. It was another show called Cool Show. It was for Cool Show. Just to clarify, show to Street Fighter Show. Yes. Keeps it showed in your first show. Sorry, I'm so used to like shortening it to show it. And like everybody just knowing what it is. Yeah, sorry. I just wanted to clarify. Yeah, it's a shitty new around. It's a question we used to go. But I told Stamper if he could do voices. I was really fucking scared because I've never asked like someone to do voices for me. And he was like, yeah, OK. And he did voices that were like mind bogglingly better than what I originally had. And then he like went ahead and did like the script. So I like typed out some really perverted shit and gave it to him. And he like made it come to fruition even better than I thought. That's amazingly fucked up stuff. It's just amazingly fucked up shit that I still have yet to actually release because it's an appropriate place. Stuff that if you honestly released, the FBI would be knocking your door pretty fast. That's mind boggling. Could be asking you for autographs. So it was really funny. But that's your sick fuck. But you're pretty sweet. Pretty funny stuff. I guess generally that's how I met Stamper. We're through making show. And I guess how I truly met Zach.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:14.736 --> 0:13:14.753]:

  Amazing, you fucked up shit, I still...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:15.098 --> 0:14:16.380]: 
  It was a good one.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:22.877 --> 0:14:23.907]: 
  Like shrimpohinstore.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:32.378 --> 0:14:59.834]: 
  was from him making epic choices. I know the story from you coming to me. How did you find me in the first place? How did you even find my stuff? Oh, oh god, you're not going to like me if I bring it up. The first thing I saw from you was fucking rehab for fictional character. And unfortunately, I actually thought it was very good. And I was impressed by it. I was like, wow, this guy is actually really good. And then I looked and saw you were like,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:35.044 --> 0:14:36.124]: 
  I know the stuff.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:46.266 --> 0:14:47.667]: 
  first thing they saw.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:51.531 --> 0:14:52.898]: 
  Ja, in den Fusschen.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:00.424 --> 0:15:47.894]: 
  working talking to Oni and stuff and then you were going around being like Oni's faggot. And I was like, so obviously trolling. You know, that's funny that Cartoon actually brings up how I kind of, my first interaction with Stamper, when they released that Rehab Official Characters cartoon, basically Rehab Official Characters is that I animated a Bo Burnham song that he did like four or five years ago. And they animated it in a horrible tween to Family Guy style. But anyways, I reviewed it. It was like the best reviewed cartoon I ever put out. It was the first two members on the front page and I was really stoked. But there was a couple of asses of really fucking malicious of me because it sucked. And Stamper commented and gave it five stars out of five. It said like, fuck those guys. They don't know what they're talking about. I was like, wow, that's so nice.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:27.087 --> 0:15:28.133]: 
  But anyways

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:48.619 --> 0:16:18.488]: 
  And I held on to that for years, I met Stamper, and I brought that up and he was like, oh, that was an accident. I was trying to review a different cartoon. And I was like, oh yeah, that's fine. That's fine, I do that. Chris, how'd you meet Stamper? It was also a Pico day, and I walked up to him in the downstairs basement, and when everyone was meeting each other. And I was like, hey man, I'm a huge fan of your stuff. And he was like, really? I'm not a fan of you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:12.480 --> 0:16:12.615]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:20.648 --> 0:17:55.975]: 
  Sweet. But then I thought he hated me for like long time. I was like, okay. But then one day on Skype he was talking to me. He was like, yeah, you can move into my house if you want. I was like, that's funny. And he was like, no, I'm serious. I was like, what? I didn't even know him. But yeah, that's that. What a nice guy. How did you meet Zach? I actually don't know this story. Oh, fuck. Chris and I at the airport, we locked eyes. We went to each other and kissed. I mean, that's what we did for the first time we met. When we were talking to each other for like a year, and then we were like, let's meet up at Omicron. And then Zach got off the plane and he fucking saw me and Sean for the first time. I was Sean, Kylie. Zach saw me and Sean and Zach, we walked up to Zach. We ran up to him and we went to hug him and Zach like shit his pants. He was afraid of us because he thought we were going to hit him. I didn't think you were going to hit me the way. You guys were really awkward though. You guys came in like fucking gremlins. You were fucking awkward. You were like gremlin. I was not a gremlin. I was really cool. You were fucking galloping all around. You just kind of ran into each other and slammed into each other. You were like, no. I didn't, you know, most people are like three foot tall. Sean, Kylie, Chris, you know, like abnormally tall freaks. Yeah, yeah, they're huge disgusting controls. Yeah, that's exactly what Chris said when I first saw him. And I ran the fuck away. And then what? Well, they know actually how we actually met the first time. Zach's hair was fucking bright yellow red. This is a true story. This is a true story. Yeah, so for my high school graduation, I decided to dye my hair like a shade darker. You know, so it looked good. It happened before. This was years. Yeah, this happened twice. All right, OK. And basically, yeah, it worked. It worked for about two weeks. Two minutes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:42.518 --> 0:16:42.872]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:49.849 --> 0:17:51.081]: 
  That's great.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:56.970 --> 0:18:55.459]: 
  That's why I said for how it went. It was probably really much slower process. It probably was not. But anyways, bright orange. My hair is naturally dark brown. Turn the fucking bright orange. My asshole's always bright orange though. That doesn't count. Oh, what do you call that? What do you call that shake that comes out of your ass, Zach? You got a good word for it. Swamp ass. Oh, mustard. Ass mustard. Yeah, it's like when you kind of feel a swab. You go and wipe and there's that yellow. It's like when you make a sandwich and you shake the bottle. You get that liquidy. That's swamp ass. Yeah, but it's yellow. Do you get yellow swamp ass corn? Swamp ass has repercussions. Jeff, is yours yellow or green? No, no, swamp ass. No, because I eat like this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:55.274 --> 0:19:05.905]: 
  Wait hold on let's back it up. What's back it up? I wanna get a consensus on this. I like olives. No, not just olives.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:57.990 --> 0:19:00.657]: 
  I want to get a consensus on this.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:02.007 --> 0:21:22.947]: 
  No, not just olives. Blue cheese olives. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. When I went to see these olives, what are you fucking doing? When I went to see these olives, these olives are great. These are like 899 olives. You can eat the whole jar of olives. What is 899? You don't eat them all at one go. I was thinking these were some under the table, like fucking like black market olives. I wasn't thinking it's just prestigious top dollar olives. It's called down. The Asmester guy said it's all well done. The Asmester said it's all up. You know olives? I know olives. I was always disappointed because they look like grapes, but they taste like shit. I have the opposite. I like olives. You know something else I really like, that people were like, it's like disgusting or revolting. I actually really like canned spinach. Like watery shitty canned spinach. No, it's because I grew up, my dad, he would only buy the shittiest of shit spinach. So I grew up only eating it. Do you know why they made canned spinach? Why? That's the only reason they made it. It was good. That's why I like canned spinach. I like peas too. Did you hear about the sky? It was Mexico. It was like this guy in Kentucky. He ate a can of spinach and his bite got bigger. They grew like teta chews. That's another reason why I like spinach. He was a sailor too. That's another reason why I watched spinach. He used to watch a show every night at 5 am. Papa the sailor man, it was a good show. I used to eat the spinach and I would be like, I would eat it out of the jar with my hands and do this. Papa was based on a real guy and his muscles were really good. I actually ate spinach. I'm telling you, that fucking cartoon actually made me want to eat spinach. They took it to the hospital and the poke was spicy. It was good at stuff. Can spinach is good. It was strong to the finish. If it's like a 20 cent canned spinach that looks rancid and yellow, it's probably delicious. Do you remember that Robin Williams movie where he has tumors on his arms? And he's supposed to be Papa? Yes. That was a bad movie.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:06.681 --> 0:19:08.436]:

  I'm telling you!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:03.945 --> 0:21:07.776]: 
  made me want to eat. It took me to the hospital. Every kid wanted to eat. It was good stuff.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:09.059 --> 0:21:10.459]: 
  He was strong to the finish.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:24.972 --> 0:21:30.355]: 
  I remember that in olive oil and brudus. What the fuck are we talking about?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:26.507 --> 0:23:16.465]: 
  and olive oil and brutus. What the fuck are we talking about? Chris, what's a disgusting food you like? What's a disgusting food? He'd hear to ask for one. I only eat good food. I don't think I eat any food that anyone else can say is disgusting. I also like steamed. I like sugar's got to be. I like steamed cabbage. I'm sure we disagree on something. I like. One time we were in a restaurant, did you ask the waitress if he could put peanut butter on top of a hamburger? That's because fucking Jonas brought me to a restaurant where you do that. Yeah, but she laughed at you. We all laughed at you too. We pointed a laugh at you. She fucking broke a bottle and pointed at me. You like peanut butter, thank you for all I eat. Yeah. This is something Chris and I can share. We went to the Olive Garden. They're known for having OK like Italian food. You ordered pizza. Oh my god. This is a beautiful pizza? That was the most, dude, I honestly swear. I think someone puked on a piece of bread and called it pizza. I was adamant to say that it was bad tasting, but I could actually smell the rocks inside the fucking meat. It was like Corey, does this taste wrong to you? But he fucking bit into it and he almost puked. I mean, I can eat fucking like poop from a can, but I could not eat that piece. If you, the best way to describe it was I'm not joking, cardboard with dried glue. With dried glue. That's what the cheese was like, was like glue. I heard that Olive Garden burned to the ground. See, I mocked you. I made funny for that. And then I ordered a $22 steak from Olive Garden. Oh my god. Terrible. Fuck the Olive Garden. The only thing you can order from Olive Garden. Okay, well. Cabin cast sponsored by the Olive Garden. I usually get there chicken Alfredo. I've never had a problem with a chicken Alfredo. Look, you go tell the uncle. I'll tell you what. You don't go all in and eat pizza or steak or fun. Pizza's Italian. I'll tell you what. You don't go in and eat pizza. Shut up. I'll tell you what.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:28.499 --> 0:21:29.444]: 
  I don't believe so.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:07.872 --> 0:27:12.377]: 
  A Mexican team is not fun and they try to like break your fucking heels. I'm not joking.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:11.078 --> 0:27:13.002]: 
  I'm not joking.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:13.002 --> 0:27:17.440]: 
  Why they're not violent when they play soccer? Okay, no offense Mexican team

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:15.955 --> 0:27:18.435]: 
  We're playing a Mexican team in Mexico.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:18.435 --> 0:27:27.936]: 
  No, no, they're just like friends. They're like Mexican friends. Oh, they're not Mexican, they're Spanish people. Oh, they're Hispanic. Okay, well, alright.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:27.936 --> 0:27:32.948]: 
  So they all decided to join up as a team.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:31.885 --> 0:27:31.935]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:31.935 --> 0:29:57.246]: 
  Alright, this is gonna sound... Oh, Mexico! All 12 people of Mexico, they can sound even bad up front. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. This is gonna sound incredibly racist, okay? Oh, right. But this Hispanic group of people were friends, and then they wanted to play for a cow. Or like a pig. A cow? A pig. Like, play for a pig. Whoever wins gets the pig, the family pig. I'm not even fucking joking. I swear to each. It's kind of like a barter system they got going. Yeah, yeah. It's true. And I was like... No, no, you won. I thought this was gonna be a wholesome game of soccer. I was learning... Just innocent. Here's the thing, though. What's the interest of the pig? It was no longer here. No, no, no, that's the thing, though. We were playing soccer before at a soccer field, so we were just playing, we were having fun. I was learning how to play soccer, so I was like being these first steps, trying to kick balls and stuff. Then these guys come out, and we're like, okay, we're gonna play now, and I go up there. Was it like Kung-Pu soccer? Have you seen that? They fucking like kick my ankle and almost break my legs, and I'm like, if I touch the ball, they like tackle underneath me. They were literally like kicking me. Maybe they were just playing normally. No. They were just bad. They were an actual, like, they were fighting for the pig. That's why they were fucking beating my ass to the... Cory, what else would I have to admit to you? If I was fighting for a pig, I would go crazy, too. Yeah, but I didn't even know how to keep a ball in my general direction, and these assholes were fucking tackling me and kicking me while I was... Cory, have you ever had a pig before? No, listen, okay, I have, and pigs delicious. But that's precisely... No, a pig, a full pig. The whole story, what actually ended up happening was we lost because, guess what, I'm not good at soccer, and I fucking failed the team because I kicked the ball out of bounds like seven times, and so they got default points. Is your dad proud? No, he wasn't, or not. Oh. But, so that, but anyways, the tangent before that was I went to a dodgeball thing, and this dodgeball thing we used to do was like a community dodgeball thing. They did it every single Sunday. It was like a special thing where you could go play dodgeball with random people, and there was this guy who was... Before, there was this guy who, before every game, I'm not even fucking joking, he would power up like a Super Saiyan and power up. Cory, is this the guy who showed you his dick as a power ranger? No! But to do that, you're a different guy. It's a different story. This is the guy who, he would power up. He was like this nerdy guy, these girls would be around him, they'd be like, hey, let's go, let's do something. He's like, hold on, babe, I've been watching Dragon Ball Z all day, I gotta get ready to power up, and he would get up off his stool, and he would actually like go, hold on!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:32.948 --> 0:27:33.792]: 
  어? 멕시코?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:33.792 --> 0:27:37.302]: 
  12 people in Mexico with the same thing, you're so not even bad at playing. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:58.716 --> 0:27:59.492]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:03.374 --> 0:28:04.909]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:03.998 --> 0:28:04.504]: 
  Of course still.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:06.411 --> 0:28:10.748]: 
  Let's say she's the pig. It was no longer here.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:16.131 --> 0:28:16.148]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:22.172 --> 0:28:24.518]: 
  Was it like Kung Fu soccer? Have you seen that?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:22.459 --> 0:28:22.949]: 
  Like kung fu.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:32.179 --> 0:28:34.947]: 
  They're just playing normally. No, they were just bad.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:39.537 --> 0:28:41.595]: 
  I asked the board what else would it be?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:44.228 --> 0:28:45.949]: 
  Yeah, but I didn't even know how to keep a ball.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:45.949 --> 0:28:46.776]: 
  I'm a general director.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:52.699 --> 0:28:58.740]: 
  I have and pigs delicious. But that's precisely. Don't eat pig, eat full pig. Bulls story, what actually ended up happening was we lost.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:57.998 --> 0:28:58.437]: 
  happening.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:21.512 --> 0:31:46.799]: 
  Yeah, I'm at level one or level two Did you guys understand? I asked him, when I got out of the house, I was like, by the way dude, what power are you? He was like 13, discovered it recently Hahaha I'm not even joking That's shit, that's worthless He's barely stronger than the farmer Whatever He was super sad at 13 and he fucking destroyed Okay No one, he fucking dropped every single ball That's because he's a shitty power level He was like this seven foot giant who couldn't catch balls and was kind of 20 If he's seven feet, why is he playing dodgeball?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:22.650 --> 0:31:28.050]: 
  Okay

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:33.822 --> 0:31:36.927]: 
  It's so disgusting! It's so disgusting! Alright, I'll get you a shot of it!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:47.727 --> 0:33:10.887]: 
  And the one woman, I think we were talking, we talked about something, was it like an anime came up? Well, basically, the lady behind you, it was a table of Jeff and I, and another guy Nile, and these ladies across from us, these old fucking bitches, if you ask me, were hollering at us, they said, Hey boys, you gonna play some poker tonight? And Jeff obviously got really horny, and Jeff, what did you say? I was like, yes. Energy, yes, the energy. I started squeezing their cottage cheese in the past. Yes, yes. There's more to this story. He milked the dusted rotisseries, but the real story is... Why did she ask us? Because basically, there was people, there was old guys coming into the store, this pizza place, with backpacks, like fucking losers, going back to this dirty old room, some dirty factory, to play fantasy football, a stale room with stale burritos. And so this lady was kind of directing everybody in, so a guy would walk in and she would say, oh right back there boys, have fun. We equated that to, I don't know, some kind of show or something. She said, are you playing poker tonight? I said, no, we only play Pokemon cards, that's what we're cool. We're cool, that's all we do is play Pokemon. Right, you're like smirking at her and rolling her eyes, that's all we do.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:55.135 --> 0:31:56.249]: 
  What basically, basically...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:07.926 --> 0:32:09.192]: 
  the horn as he said.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:20.970 --> 0:32:21.325]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:22.388 --> 0:32:24.075]: 
  Yes! Yeah!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:28.362 --> 0:32:30.387]: 
  Why did she ask us? I don't...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:50.468 --> 0:32:52.594]: 
  Back there boys! Have fun!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:57.420 --> 0:32:59.310]: 
  Basically, he said a lot.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:02.888 --> 0:33:03.951]: 
  That's right.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:03.192 --> 0:33:03.934]: 
  That's right.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:07.680 --> 0:33:08.575]: 
  It's working out.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:09.570 --> 0:33:09.959]: 
  You got it!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:10.583 --> 0:33:15.443]: 
  No, I was- I was being so- I was being- I was- I was not being-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:11.849 --> 0:33:41.329]: 
  I was being so nasty, I was being dirty. I was not being kind to you. She's like listen, I wasn't there, so why can't I be like that? Do you like anime? Yeah. And then I'm laughing and I'm just like oh my god I just want this to be over. And then Nile back here, he's like in the most straight face ever. He's like, oh no the woman was like, My daughter! My daughter loves anime, she's 32 and loves anime. And then Nile sits up and he's like, does your daughter like hentai?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:15.443 --> 0:33:16.995]: 
  That wasn't there so I can't

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:16.995 --> 0:33:17.974]: 
  He's like, Ed.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:22.007 --> 0:33:22.395]: 
  That was...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:30.732 --> 0:33:31.002]: 
  No, no.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:31.002 --> 0:33:33.145]: 
  The woman was like my daughter

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:42.257 --> 0:34:31.094]: 
  And she's like, yeah, it's like anime. It's like, did she like hentai? Now Jeff isn't a facing lady, so he's fucking bobbing his head up and down laughing. I tried to like see Jeff. I don't have to, I have to face this lady. Jeff's like pissing his pants. I'm trying to keep it together. I don't know what they have faces they were making. I don't know if they were picking up on anything, but. Yeah, then Jeff got up and pushed the old lady over, broke her back and killed her. The moral of the story is, her daughter watched hentai. Yeah, I told you it wasn't a very good story. I look convinced that I guarantee that the old lady's going to go back to her daughter and say, oh, do you like hentai? Oh, I like hentai! Do you like hentai? And the daughter's going to scream, and she's going to say, oh, the nice bit, the spaghetti restaurant loved hentai. I love hentai!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:42.848 --> 0:33:43.405]: 
  AHH

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:51.032 --> 0:33:54.711]: 
  Yeah spagetting

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:01.984 --> 0:34:02.744]:

  if you're picking up on any.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:11.569 --> 0:34:13.020]: 
  the story is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:14.826 --> 0:34:15.484]: 
  I told you what

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:23.837 --> 0:34:26.385]: 
  Do you have a headdress? Oh, I don't have a headdress.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:31.954 --> 0:34:37.928]: 
  that way the best or she could be chubby cool be like oh I love hentai and terrified of dogs

Really fat pussy on Google images. What are you just fat pussy or very fat pussy? Speaking of Nile. Oh, sorry. Can I just say one thing? Speaking of Nile, he said, do you ever hear of the porn star Faye Reagan? Faye Reagan? She's like, she's really famous. She's like the perky-titted red-head skinny girl. I think she voiced the fucking girl in Santa Included. Really? On here girl. Yeah, I could have sworn. I could not. I swear to God. I think she voiced Nina in Santa Inc. Anyways, Nile was like, dude, Faye Reagan has a nasty-ass pussy. And I was like, oh no, because I thought she was really hot. And then if you look up Faye Reagan, warts in pussy, you can see a video. Warts in pussy. I think it's fake though because the camera cuts just says it goes to the pussy. Personally, like... Because there was fucking warts in the pussy. It looks really... It looks like... Who wants to watch what pussy warts get fucked? It looks like... It looks like the Giants Cosway. It's horrible.

They like, they were in my room. Was it spaghetti, some noodle, or raw? I would eat spaghetti and they would like, fucking, swoop out a packet. You had a hundred birds in your house doing spaghetti?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:36.936 --> 0:39:37.780]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:53.085 --> 0:40:29.400]: 
  Just what? What? They just flew around your house all day? That's not important! What is important is the story about the bird of the cage. This sounds like something about the skin to the bird person. Are you remembering like a bad Ben Stiller movie? Sorry, is this... Are you sure you're not mixing up your childhood with like a bad movie? No, this actually is not... This sounds terrifying, boy. My dad was a bird enthusiast, so we got a lot of birds at the house and then... Okay, let's go again. They were exciting because they come down and like walk on your soldier and shit. It lies down your arm while they land on you. These were the good birds. They were fucking squawking like this, motherfucker. We would just sit there and look at it. I would look at it. I'd be like, shut up. And it'd be like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:54.655 --> 0:39:56.460]: 
  I was so dead in this It's not important but it's

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:59.329 --> 0:40:01.506]: 
  Are you remembering?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:07.986 --> 0:40:08.003]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:08.003 --> 0:40:09.387]: 
  That's terrifying.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:12.222 --> 0:40:13.842]: 
  Okay, they were exciting because

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:18.786 --> 0:40:19.950]: 
  and start your arm around the neck.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:19.950 --> 0:40:21.267]: 
  Oh, it's great.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:30.953 --> 0:41:03.674]: 
  Maybe you were squawking because you were telling the show You were fucking staring at the eyes and telling the show So why did you do it? You're supposed to, you know, you're supposed to put a fucking You're supposed to put a blanket over the bird, right? Not over the bird, but the cage, but the cage Whatever, the cage You're putting pillowcases on the bird and fucking sucking it Shut up! Okay, you put a pillowcase over the fucking bird And fucking stuck it into a pillow and hit it over the wall No, I put a fucking pillowcase over the cage Yeah And I went to sleep, I would like just fucking use it and I went to bed and I just heard it go

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:36.319 --> 0:40:38.277]: 
  They're so grudges from it

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:39.762 --> 0:40:40.740]: 
  You're giving space to us.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:42.816 --> 0:40:45.752]: 
  That over the board of the cage, what the hell are you doing with the cage? Whatever the cage...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:04.619 --> 0:41:41.592]: 
  AHHHHHH! AHHHHHH! For fucking like 20 minutes. You know how they're supposed to fall asleep? Cause they feel like they're- I don't know. I've never had a bird. You're supposed to put something over to cover its eyes so it thinks it's nighttime. Well this motherfucker was a bat because it never went to bed and it would squawk and squawk and squawk. Eventually- I hated your house. Well, eventually I couldn't take care of the bird because every time I would- My dad would be like, take care of the bird, I'm going there to try and feed it, it would fucking pet my hand. Oh my god. And so I was terrified of it so it was like this fucking like- Feet flea-ridden fucking bird. Making hand gestures like it was a creepy praying mantis. Why'd you do that, Kori? Is that a T-Rex?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:09.242 --> 0:41:11.892]: 
  I don't know I've never had a bird

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:13.562 --> 0:41:14.001]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:14.001 --> 0:41:16.077]: 
  I think it's nighttime. Well this motherfucker was a bad guy.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:24.227 --> 0:41:25.088]: 
  Every time I go.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:31.433 --> 0:41:31.804]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:42.216 --> 0:41:58.956]: 
  So basically I was terrified of it and I was young so... But the bird scared me and I didn't know what to do and it squawked all the time and eventually my dad sent it back to the exotic place. He really killed it. No he sent it back to the exotic place. Just find other places that... Oh no he freed it outside he just let it go outside.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:55.615 --> 0:41:56.003]: 
  Just for a minute.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:56.003 --> 0:42:01.859]: 
  He's gettin' into other places that keepmie me.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:00.002 --> 0:43:25.542]:

Yeah, just in general. It was like it was literally like a It was like seven feet tall. It was a big fucking cage and had lots of room to move in the only thing was it just squawked They never actually talked I can see why you like bad comedies like like Like because you're like you're your child. What's that with board store movie fucking board Bucky Larissa? Yeah, born to be a porn star That is pretty mature The best movie you fucking reviewed it like it was like a fucking survive. I love I love that so we had a house full like 20 birds Okay, all right big deal No, no, they actually all died except for one and that one actually like well they all died anyway A few years extra it was so died it was It still came down and took my spaghetti while I ate, but it was an entertaining I still have no idea what the fuck that even means. I just want to share I don't have one question about animals and pets Yeah, back in you know up until this point everybody has a pet because it's kind of like a source of entertainment Yeah, do you think pets? I've always kind of thought pets are kind of slowly getting less and less popular I've always thought they were kind of a bad idea are always are gonna find better and newer things

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:07.410 --> 0:42:10.937]: 
  No, it was a huge fucking cage. Oh, you mean a general? It was huge.

No, it would sound like you were ripping off its fucking leg and you weren't. It was just like, it's hungry and then you give it to it's like, eeew, because you give it food. And then when it's, it would do that constantly. It would just, I'd be sitting there and then it would just go, whee, and I'd go, holy fucking shit, feed it or something. And it had it in the back room. A day. And she's like, oh, it's adorable. I don't know, it's not. It's really not. With cats or puppies, they're like a certain size, but pigs are fucking massive and they're all kind of looking disgusting. I know, but the thing is like, the thing is like, a pig is cute, you know, a piglet is adorable, but then when you get the piglet being squill- Yeah, with little size. I'm gonna tell you something, a pig squill will fucking ruin your ears. Zach. Yes. If you could have any animals a pet, like, ignore how dangerous or exotic they are. If you could just have an animal that would automatically be nice to you, what would it be?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:30.494 --> 0:44:32.198]: 
  Whenever it was like it's her

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:35.725 --> 0:44:37.007]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:37.007 --> 0:44:37.952]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:03.501 --> 0:45:04.142]: 
  It is like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:08.496 --> 0:45:09.475]: 
  It's loyal size.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:23.380 --> 0:46:16.840]: 
  Find something really dangerous that could assist me. Yeah, like a bear, like a wolf or something. Mouse? Yeah, a dangerous mouse that could fucking bite my neighbor's feet. Bites his lover? Mice? Yeah. But would you? So a bear? Yeah, like a bear or a wolf or something that could like, that guy's on my yard. Instead of a bear, I'd have to go attack him. Komodo dragon be cool. They eat bones. Everything. They don't leave a trace. They're kind of terrifying. Yeah, they're cool. How big are those those fucking rocks? They're like, nine feet long, dudes. No, they don't wash their own legs. That'd be horrible. What's yours, dude? That'd be like, it's kind of sour. That's like tiny lizards, dude. That's still like a heat, no. You're thinking of the Jesus lizard. That runs across water. That's Jesus, dude. I think I'm thinking of a Jurassic Park enemy. I would pick a unicorn so I could sell it for a billion dollars. That's not going to be a good idea. You could sell the horn for a billion dollars. You'd keep the horse. He's fucking over you. I need to prove, I need to show the dead body to prove that the horn came from it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:32.999 --> 0:45:33.825]: 
  Bye trooper.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:52.489 --> 0:45:56.927]: 
  I'm like, that'd be horrible. That'd be like, that's like tiny lizard.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:58.649 --> 0:45:59.459]: 
  You're thinking of the G

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:01.045 --> 0:46:01.450]:

  That's exciting.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:09.297 --> 0:46:10.782]: 
  That's a good idea.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:13.229 --> 0:46:14.882]: 
  I need to prove, I need to show the dude.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:17.582 --> 0:46:59.888]: 
  Jeff, what animal would you fuck if it was beggin' for it? If it was really askin' for it? If you were trapped on the earth. If you stumbled upon it, if you stumbled on the wood, and you saw the animal put his ass on it, what would you fuck? Who would you, what animal would that be? A snake, you know. What if you went to a place with a snake with sticky its ass on it? I put a lot of thought into this, Zach. But I just can't decide. I just got into your head, and they were saying you must fuck an animal. That's not fair. You must fuck a horny animal, but it wants to fuck you, it's not, you're not worth it either. Am I in the desert with it, Jeff? Yeah, yeah, dude. The sun's beating down. What if it's like you have to fuck any animal, but then they just, but you want to come on. But you want to come on. But you choose the animal. Real question. No where's art comes back from time. Cory, we've just- Animals start walkin' off. He's like, choose an animal.

  Like a snake or a whip.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:30.492 --> 0:46:31.437]: 
  Like a steak over there.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:34.322 --> 0:46:36.938]: 
  I put a lot of thought into this deck.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:36.938 --> 0:46:38.524]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:00.479 --> 0:48:53.946]: 
  Cory, we still need to fuck the animal first. We have to fuck the animal first. This is serious. We have to... Alright, so as we fucking know our carnival would you fuck? The fat women count? What? Fat women? Yeah. That's not an animal. What? Yeah, they're animals. You keep them pig-sties, you throw apples at them, like, throw tomatoes at them. I don't know! What do I say? I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know. Chris, what's a pretty animal? A cat. I would fuck a cat if it really wanted to. I feel like it would be a fucking cat. Some of those duck heads put sesame in it and you're like, oh, you want it? You're gonna rupture it inside. No, that might take, that might take. If you've seen this, uh, account, you buy. That doesn't bear any... Let me tell you something. Yes, it's twisted like a little... Let me be fucking a fork. So Cory, recently you shaved your head. Oh, yeah. Okay, I can tell you about the experience. If somebody's ever had a long thing of hair and you go to, like, a professional to shave your hair, I shaved my hair because Chris and everyone... I never fucking shaved it. You did. I did. I did too. I did it. I did it. Basically, in order to be a part of sleepy cabin, you have to shave your head, okay? I'm sorry, that's my requirements. This is part of the positive because you guys are all with sleepy cabin, all of a sudden you're all shaved heads. Yeah. And you guys are like telling me... You're gonna stab Chris, myself, and Cory, the whole shaved head. You're gonna, all right. And you fucking, the fuckers are trying to peer pressure me to do it. You have. I'm like, I'm like, I'm not gonna give off the impression this place is filled with fucking skinheads. I'm not doing that. I'm gonna keep my hair. Or you blew on it? I mean, I did it for the team so we could all maintain that impression and have a bunch of fucking knobs. So here's the thing. Everyone shaved their head and I had, like, a fucking lion's mane and I'm like, I cannot stand having this rug on my fucking head anymore. So I went in and shaved it. Let me tell you something. I never shaved my head before for as long as I've been. When I was a kid, I used to get, like, buzz cuts, but I was young. I didn't give a shit. I went to a professional to do it. I never did it myself. I never did it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:08.680 --> 0:47:09.608]: 
  What the fuck

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:13.304 --> 0:47:15.092]:

  But Harry Potter universe are like one feat. What do you thought on aliens? Like a spooky grey alien? You've never seen an alien? I've heard, I know I've never seen an alien, but I've heard from various sources of believing aliens that are actually 12 alien... 12 different species? Yes. I know there's a big... There's a galactic council. I have a question. The BC species... I'm actually being serious. Yes. Is a reptilian considered an alien? Yes, they think they're the sexy gods. I've heard there are reptilians that actually live underground. They're the big angels. Have you ever seen a video? No, no, no. Have you ever seen a video of our president? Cory! Our president. Right? This is important. That blanks yes, and it's yes. Yes, he's a reptilian. 240p video, terrible quality, and then he transforms. Because that's what aliens do. They blink while they're giving a natural appearance. See, if I was a reptilian who controlled the media and the earth, the first thing I would do is reveal myself on national television. Exactly. In a 240p quality video I might add. Of course.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:40.589 --> 0:58:41.939]:

  This isn't dead blank.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:12.027 --> 0:59:12.195]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:16.229 --> 0:59:20.380]: 
  Because that's what aliens do. They blink while they're giving a natural glance.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:30.201 --> 1:03:15.702]: 
  So the grey aliens, the greens, there are apparently gigantic like hairy, I think like bat aliens. Sasquatch. Yeah, they're very large. Wow. I know there's big white ones. I don't know what they're called. I don't know what they're called. I don't know what they're called. I don't know what they're called. What about the spaghetti? The spaghetti aliens? The spaghetti aliens. You don't want to deal with those. Apparently there's jellyfish that circle the earth. Oh, Christ, don't worry. Don't even... That's true. That's a real alien. I swear to gosh, I saw UFO when I was younger. I think you didn't. I did. You saw an unidentified object. No, but you don't understand. You saw an unidentified object. Where? It was a fucking neon green spaceship. Do you recall when we were driving inside of our house and I said look up, it was like really foggy. Yeah. It wasn't that. Jeff, you can like, if you look at airplanes, they can look completely different the way the night is. Like one night was really foggy outside. Right. You see, you see Watchmen, right? The huge night owl spaceship, like ship. Yeah. It looked, it literally looked exactly like that because the way the fog was there. But I'm not talking about that. So I'm saying, yeah, the light's completely trickling on you. I'm not talking about that. I did. I was seeing my friend Helmut Bergman at his house. You're saying it's a space alien. It looked like a space alien ship. Why would a space alien be flying right around the sky? That thing though, I don't know. Here's the thing though, I was walking with Zach and we were looking up at the air and we saw an airplane. And I was like, that actually looks like it is 20 feet close to us. I said this before, we've talked about this thing. It looks 20 feet. It looks very close, I swear to God. It looked 20 feet. Not quite. I mean, I actually looked at it lower than the roof of your house. Dude, I swear to God, I was sleeping on his floor in his apartment and I looked up into the sky and it was just fucking weird. What it do. It flew by really slowly. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, it was not far away. I swear to God, to my vision it was fucking huge, right? And it looked really close to the apartment and it was like bright green. I swear to God. What's more likely that you misidentified something or that a space alien from a different, completely wrong- No, I'm saying I saw UFO. I'm saying I saw UFO that looked like- It flew above your friend's house or that you misidentified something. I said it's a UFO that looked just like a spaceship. I'm not saying it was a spaceship. But we say spaceship but it adds so much more stuff to it. It looks, dude, I swear, it looks like a fucking- But how would you know what a spaceship looks like? It didn't look like it was from this earth. Guys, if you've never seen something from this earth- Exactly, it was alien. You don't know that if you've never seen something that's alien. Exactly. If you were there that night. Identified flying object. Is your friendship over now? Is this the breaking point? I'd say you did not see the space alien. Yeah, more than likely not, but it looked like one. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying you did see the space alien. Here's something.

Is he Google mapping the- Is he Google mapping the- Is he Google mapping the- Is it less stealthy than US technology? Are you fucking kidding me? If you had access to a spaceship, you'd fly right to Mars and take a look around- I would fly the fucking Earth. What would you do if you were an alien? If you were an alien, you would. Zach, if you were an alien, he went to planet Earth, all right? I would lay in his house and kill them. Oh my God. Smash through the roof and kill everybody. That's the only way. What if you met Lloyd in space? What if you met Lloyd in space? What the fuck is Lloyd in space? What if you met him? Two Disney shows, great show. You should have fucking watched that.

You know what, the people that have never actually been high, their examples of being drunk or high are like these most fucking Mondays. It's whatever they ride at high care trips. It's like, whoa, man, look at the chair. It's like, that's not what people think. Yeah, when people are high, I guarantee you're not fucking like hallucinating. Are you guys mad about that one YouTube video? No. No, that guy's just an asshole. That one's even. I was talking about this earlier. I can't. What are you like? Just in general, like, when someone's like, oh man, when I'm high.

  It's always...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:51.409 --> 1:12:52.742]: 
  Yeah, when people are high, I-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:56.725 --> 1:12:56.995]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:59.222 --> 1:12:59.729]: 
  I've seen that.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:06.276 --> 1:15:36.700]: 
  Fucking dancing elephants, like you don't see dancing elephants in the last few years. You're tripping. Is that what you said? You said you've seen a bunch of stuff. No, when I'm high, there's a huge difference. I can tell you the experience of being high. You don't see fucking dancing elephants and magic mushrooms popping out. What you see is you see like what you would see if you were really paranoid. Like when I did like really shitty weed, I got super paranoid and I started like thinking like people were telling me like- Get thoughts. Yeah, it's like it's overthinking. Like you think like people are watching you when they're not. It's just like that kind of hallucination. Like this one time, give me a story, this one time we got high before we went to this concert and I got a beer, like a normal beer, I ordered it and this woman, I gave her my card because I guess you're supposed to do that or something. Yeah, it's a pay for it, right? But I didn't understand what she was asking. She was like, I'm gonna keep this and I'm like, can I have it back? She's like, no. I'm like, what the fuck do you mean no? She's like, you can have it back when it's over. And I'm like, what's over? She's like, the concert. Can I have it back? Can I just- Because I was really uncomfortable already because it's like, you know, shitty weed makes you really uncomfortable. Wait, so what kind of situation was it? Card, you credit card? Basically, essentially, you have these weird situations where you have these miniature, it's not like where you start seeing fucking dancing worms and bugs coming out of your hand. It's just like basic hallucinations to a point where I was drinking alcohol and when I looked at it again, it was completely full. It never went down when I drank it. Yeah, people were making like- I'd drink it and it would still be full. And so because of that, I kind of got freaked out because I felt like I was in a time lapse. I also can't stand people who write drug characters. I talked with this earlier. Oh yeah, yeah. I can't stand people who write a drug character and all they fucking do is they have to walk into the house and be like, oh, hell, that's number five. It's like, this is not funny. You can stop. No drug person has ever fucking thought they were in a fast food place when they weren't. Usually you don't. That's not what drug people do, dude. Yeah. You don't hallucinate. Think you're in a fast food restaurant. Are you sure? Well, it does. I mean, when you smoke one toque of the weed, you see Bill Clinton crawling out of your ass, I don't know what these people are. The only thing that makes you tired and- Exactly....tiny bit happier and it makes you open. And if you're really already paranoid, it makes you super paranoid. I guess whatever I was smoking weed, I was probably in a bad situation because I was also drunk. Oh yeah. Smoking weed when you're drunk only makes you think about your heart beating fast, so it's so fast. I think the worst thing weed does is make you laugh, so it's not funny whatsoever. Oh god, I did. It also destroys your sense of humor. I think the last time I got high, I did the pot brownies and I watched Lord of the Rings. And I had- you've heard- I know this.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:06.749 --> 1:13:08.082]: 
  I like it still.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:06.816 --> 1:13:06.900]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:15.017 --> 1:13:17.498]: 
  There's a huge difference.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:33.985 --> 1:13:35.453]: 
  Yeah, it's like it's...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:53.745 --> 1:13:54.960]: 
  There's something to pay for, right?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:14:12.359 --> 1:14:12.679]: 
  Please.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:27.942 --> 1:15:28.414]: 
  It also

 SPEAKER_03 [1:15:37.358 --> 1:18:21.636]: 
  I had I swear to God I thought it was the funniest thing I ever thought of I thought what if they reshot all Lord the Rings but called Gandalf gubbledorf That was the only like every character called him gubbledorf and that was the only difference And I was like I was crying with laughter And I wrote it down I got so girls what the fuck does that mean? Weed stinks yeah, baby every time I've done weed it either makes me into a sack of shit or it makes me want to cry into a pillow Everybody says oh you guys must be so high you think you're a cartoon. No dude. I have high When I smoke garbage in a sense It's just I get fucking tired and now in the sense where I'm not super paranoid anymore when I smoke it I'm just like man. I'm fucking tired before I used to be paranoid because when you're driving in a car with someone Who's smoking weed you you already feel uncomfortable and then when they pass it to you and you do it You're just like all right now. I'm gonna be fucked like you you just think the worst so every time you see a cop car You think sirens are going off. It's just yeah, it's a horrible experience If you're gonna be doing weed do it in a legal if you're gonna eat If you're gonna drink marijuana it go do it responsibly don't fucking go out and explore the world while you're fucking smoking We have and don't drink alcohol and smoke we Jeff are you insulting when people say hey Jeff?
