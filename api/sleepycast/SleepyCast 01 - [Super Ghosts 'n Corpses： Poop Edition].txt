 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:48.944 --> 0:03:08.603]: 
  Well, no, I understand what you mean. That's what I thought. I thought it was a working formation that does that. It's no request of a wish. It's just these guys who really can feel better. I wasn't fucking thinking every single Cancer Association in the world that handles kids is a make your wish foundation. I just thought generally those kinds of people were the ones that dressed up as fucking... Should we start the middle? Yes. Let's just start over.

  First of all, first of all, if an alien rolled up and he was dead, he came in... He was ponderous. Doing different wheels, doing different sign language. First of all, I'd be terrified that a giant gray alien was in my room. What if you started jerking you off? Would you let him? Yeah. Why are they always threatening? What if there was a giant gray alien? You just said an alien was gonna jerk you off. No, no, no. That's not threatening. They were sleeping.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:36.812 --> 0:09:43.005]: 
  Like a ghost beer? Like somebody who died in a car accident like a few days ago. And he just kind of wanders in and he's like, hey man.

  Would you help me if I was a ghost, Corey?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:54.944 --> 0:12:04.502]: 
  If I was on a show... That's the question, like... Why would a dude that died yesterday in a car accident come to your house and he's like, Alright, do you need to find the key to my treasure? It should be like a ghost thing. He's a ghost. He needs help. He needs closure in his life? Yeah, he needs help. Yeah. Look, if you died in a car accident because Zach was driving... Alright, hold on, hold on. Would you go visit somebody and ask for... Here's the thing. If it was a sneaky situation where the guy was like, I need you to help me and avenge my death. I bet, okay, what do you need? He'd be like, I need you to go to this place... I need you to fucking kill this guy. First of all, you're not gonna talk to a ghost that casually. I need you to find my body. I'd be like, first of all, dude, you're telling me to go to a fucking abandoned house and you want me to find your body. Cory, the first thing I would do if I talked to a ghost would go to like a scientist. The first thing I would do if I talked to a ghost is shit myself. Who the fuck is gonna believe you? Why are you having a casual conversation with... He just shows up while you're sleeping. Who's having a casual conversation with me? He's like, hey, Cory, wake up. Hey, dude, listen, I need you to go talk to this guy to fucking avenge my head. If you listen to a ghost... If he's having a casual conversation with me, I think the polite thing to do would not be to run and fucking leave. He's flowing over your bed. He's flowing over your bed glowing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:11.177 --> 0:11:12.544]: 
  Yeah, you help them.

  First of all, you're not gonna talk to a ghost that casually.

I understand but it is a felony to dig up dead bodies enforcing the kiss like puppets. So you, but I'm stuck here forever if you don't have. Say whatever, say my problem dude, I don't want to go to jail. Yo, what if a ghost visited you and did this and asked you to do the same exact thing, right? Make corpses kiss like puppets. You did it and then the cops got you and they put you in prison for defiling grave sites. Which would happen. And the ghost visited you in prison and he was like I can't believe you fell for that. You fucking dumbass. I would tell somebody scientist that. What did you talk about? That would fucking shoot. Then you'd be a fucking weirdo in prison talking about ghosts. Corey you'd get like.

I would be like, no, I'm not going to do that. What if I got a better scenario? He says, look, I was a rich guy.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:29.890 --> 0:13:31.510]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:34.167 --> 0:14:35.162]: 
  Like, go there?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:36.917 --> 0:14:39.415]: 
  Take it step by step. All right, you dig her up, then what?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:39.415 --> 0:14:59.445]: 
  I would not do that. I'd go back and be like, oh man. If you're gently- She wasn't there. I look for her. If you're gently gone. If she wasn't a grave you fucking liar, you gotta believe that. He's a girl. He's a girl. I can see everything. I can follow you anywhere I go. He's like, God. He's walking behind you. He's like, oh, I'm seeing me. If you're gently- If you walk in the grave, you'd be like, oh, and you'd be like, dude, I'm right here. I see it. I know what you're gonna do.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:41.879 --> 0:14:42.216]: 
  Man.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:44.325 --> 0:14:45.372]: 
  What she wasn't

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:47.430 --> 0:14:53.151]: 
  He's a ghost, he can see everything. He's a ghost, he can see everything. He's walking behind you, he's like a lonely...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:59.445 --> 0:15:04.002]: 
  Don't even try it. Make sure you're gentle with her. Just gently, gently caress her.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:04.002 --> 0:15:20.185]: 
  She likes her neck to be kissed. Well, if that was his fantasy, wouldn't the ghost be standing next to you, beating off the wall? Yeah. Well, here's the thing though. And that brings up other questions. They shoot ghost loads. What if you come too fast? Would he cancel the deal and be like, you didn't give me what I wanted?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:09.874 --> 0:15:11.106]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:17.232 --> 0:15:17.417]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:20.185 --> 0:15:23.999]: 
  It just like turns into sparshoots and turns into sparkles or something like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:23.796 --> 0:15:27.492]: 
  Like little, yeah, like fairy mist, just shoots out.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:27.492 --> 0:15:28.707]: 
  You like the sound of that?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:29.230 --> 0:15:30.006]: 
  All you have to do is dig up the video.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:30.006 --> 0:15:35.440]: 
  it, Corwin, and he disappeared. Then he'd be like, thank you. And then he'd kind of descend into heaven.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:34.073 --> 0:16:08.565]: 
  I'm just ascended to heaven. That's how he gets into heaven. I just have to bring some Vaseline and get it over with. Alright, so after the good deed is done and he shines off to heaven, we're talking about the fucking cops. The cops kicked out my door and go upstairs. Alright, let's say, let's say, we saw it, I do, know your seamen's in her fucking pussy. This is a script for a movie, and at the end of it you find out that the guy that was being talked to by Ghost the whole time was a fucking nutcase and he's just like fucking dead. I was gonna say, what if it's one of his friends with a tamper cord in his pocket, pulling his friend the whole time?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:36.435 --> 0:15:36.824]: 
  That's how it works.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:37.853 --> 0:15:39.456]: 
  I said the brings and does

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:44.586 --> 0:15:44.704]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:53.530 --> 0:15:53.867]: 
  Let's see.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:54.930 --> 0:15:55.116]: 
  Jesus.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:32.882 --> 0:17:00.372]: 
  The only guy in the neighborhood who wears these shoes with these neon shoelaces. Why would you leave a shoe behind? And he is... We're just... It is impossible to do this. It was dark. I tripped over a branch. It's not like... So you admit to being there? Yeah. Like part of my life, looking at the crime scene... Now the cops are gonna smell your dick and smell dead bodies on it. So what are you laughing at? Do you hear something, sir? Alright. We think one of the bodies was the file. I'm already sliding out the door like a salamander. I'm lost. Right in front of the cops.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:24.267 --> 0:17:39.454]: 
  They say, he's listening like, listen sir, we don't have absolute evidence it was you, but would you like to possibly admit you did it or would you just like to drag this out further would you? We don't know if we'll catch you. Here's what I would say, I would say- That was really elaborate. I would say- That didn't happen to you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:35.370 --> 0:17:57.949]: 
  Here's what I would say I would say really elaborate. I would say If a policeman came in He said that I thought someone's late wife. I would be like listen sir I was visited by a ghost and he told me to fuck his wife because that was his fantasy I was only doing what he asked ask him. He's right here. All right. Well. Thank you for your honesty

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:40.247 --> 0:17:41.969]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:20.275 --> 0:18:21.422]: 
  external

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:24.713 --> 0:18:31.446]: 
  Was it was it like fucking sandpaper or what was it like sir? I'm just I was a morbid curiosity

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:31.446 --> 0:18:55.729]: 
  I don't know if you'd be decomposing it would be a little bit How long was she in the granddye thing? Yeah, let's say two days It was like fucking a sock with old- With maggots wrapped around a cock Why is it like a sock? What are you talking about? I said it was like fucking a sock with old meat and it with maggots wrapped around a cock Because sometimes it's easier to masturbate into a sock as opposed to shooting it on a piece of paper towel or a towel Alright, what were we talking about?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:33.758 --> 0:18:36.289]: 
  How long has she been around you?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:38.854 --> 0:18:40.103]: 
  Only two days.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:41.048 --> 0:18:42.246]: 
  Which is, well...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:41.436 --> 0:18:41.504]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:47.224 --> 0:18:47.865]: 
  Because something

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:54.126 --> 0:18:54.430]: 
  All right.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:55.307 --> 0:18:59.189]: 
  What if you got formaldehyde all over your dick and then it preserved your dick?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:56.742 --> 0:18:57.906]: 
  Holy fuck.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:59.189 --> 0:19:04.285]: 
  What's from Al-Qaeda? Forever and like you just had a baby peach dick. They dipped it in.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:03.289 --> 0:19:13.296]: 
  They pump it, they remove the blood from bodies and pump it from out high to sort of preserve them for a time. It slows down the decomposing process.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:12.824 --> 0:19:24.248]: 
  It's like you go more in the open caskets without being disgusted by the maggots crawling through your dead grandma. So they can look nice. So are actually maggots going through them usually? Not yet. Do it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:13.988 --> 0:19:16.840]: 
  More and in the open caskets

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:19.995 --> 0:19:21.295]: 
  you're looking nice.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:22.577 --> 0:19:25.935]: 
  Not yet, but... They get through the casket, maybe.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:25.868 --> 0:19:26.948]: 
  But see, even I don't think so.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:26.948 --> 0:19:29.445]: 
  because a lot of us pretty well see old.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:27.555 --> 0:19:57.593]: 
  Well, I actually heard something. Yeah, it seems like- I actually heard something. I feel like it's a misconception of older caskets. I actually heard something. Since we're talking about dead people, I actually heard this. I don't know if it's true, but I remember hearing this theory that like fucking caskets are like complete bullshit, how people pay like $17,000 for a casket, and then when they bury their loved one, ultimately when they're buried, they cave in immediately to like- Well, they ground-caved it though, wouldn't it? No, no, like the caskets actually cave in. So almost every casket cave- Well, I'm saying the casket cave in with the ground cave in? It's not?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:29.445 --> 0:19:31.251]: 
  Yeah, it seems like she's... I actually heard something.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:31.909 --> 0:19:33.951]: 
  Hold on, hold on. I actually heard somebody say something.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:53.340 --> 0:19:55.939]: 
  Almost every cast a king, that's not true.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:56.007 --> 0:19:56.395]: 
  It is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:57.492 --> 0:20:01.289]: 
  Because bodies get exhumed all the time for various reasons.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:01.289 --> 0:20:51.947]: 
  Yeah, no, yeah, they have to dig up bodies sometimes. Yeah, no No, I think I think they case sometimes they case the cascading like concrete or something Well, could you imagine if you paid like about like mythbusters or something like that? I could have sworn He if they if the second they drop the durian that it collapsed the fucking ground collapse I think that was a mythbusters episode and they like fucking well I think it's being bullshit. No, no, they debunked it if you could breathe it was possibly buried six feet under and like You know still live yeah suffocating through the stores of the no from like living six there is those fucked up funeral homes Where you pay for a coffin and they put you in a fucked up box and just like bury you and they kill take your money as a Profits that's a yeah, Cory question. Yeah, Barenson was really expensive. Let's say let's say Stamper Zach me and Chris all

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:04.090 --> 0:20:04.461]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:17.337 --> 0:20:18.130]: 
  to live because it's...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:22.349 --> 0:20:22.973]: 
  Well, no!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:22.534 --> 0:20:22.939]: 
  No!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:30.567 --> 0:20:30.837]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:43.864 --> 0:20:46.463]: 
  That's a good one. Hey, Corey, question.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:51.947 --> 0:21:00.452]: 
  died. Okay. You're alive and you went to the funeral home and they said listen we we us guys at the funeral home are big fans of internet animation

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:00.452 --> 0:21:07.523]: 
  and we're gonna give you four caskets for free. But, they're like, but, they're not equal though, but they're like, we have the really good one, the other one.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:07.523 --> 0:21:19.774]: 
  Okay one the not so good one and there's a really terrible one So would you like to just tell us which body you'd like in which casket? Yeah, go go who gets the best casket?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:14.577 --> 0:21:14.627]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:16.889 --> 0:22:02.451]: 
  Who gets the best casket? You're on the spot. Three of us and Chris. Me, Stamper, Psychic Pabblezak, Johnny Utah, and Chris O'Neill aka Oni. Four caskets of degrading quality, best to the worst. So essentially he's literally like, you see a fucking gold rim casket, then you see one that's falling over. And then you see one like the wooden cup in Indiana Jones where it's like... What's literally a wooden box with like a whole depot? One's literally a shoe box where they have to cut you into parts and maybe put a couple parts in it. I would ask him if we could not do the last one. No, shut up asshole. You would ask him what kind of business he's running because this is a bullshit.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:34.067 --> 0:21:35.249]: 
  Okay, so

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:41.003 --> 0:21:41.948]: 
  And then you see one like this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:45.576 --> 0:21:46.572]: 
  Hardware Box

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:00.494 --> 0:22:05.219]: 
  Because this is a bullshit. We'll put Chris and Zach and Casket number three together. No, you can't really.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:04.037 --> 0:22:35.003]: 
  No, I think I think I would the biggest casket. I would put the best casket No, yeah, you know what you just I saw you smile the best casket you need to be honest the best casket with gold rim and everything Yeah, yeah, I would put two people inside of it to save money That would make the afterlife to horrible because they're normal size caskets. It's not like a like sir I would put Chris's tamper both Oh, we see now as a way as I would put

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:09.387 --> 0:22:10.416]: 
  Yeah, it's good.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:09.674 --> 0:22:09.724]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:17.099 --> 0:22:18.550]: 
  I would play support.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:21.115 --> 0:22:21.638]: 
  Aynen

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:25.975 --> 0:22:27.578]: 
  I felt like a pig sir.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:29.839 --> 0:22:31.020]: 
  Slide 3

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:35.003 --> 0:22:41.888]: 
  So this is begs the question who gets the worst casket mirrors act and there's still two other

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:39.795 --> 0:22:47.997]: 
  I'm dead man, who gets the worst cat? Who gets the fucking shoebox?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:46.967 --> 0:22:52.519]: 
  Who gets the shoebox that gets invaded by... The worst one gets filled with maggots too, like in a week.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:51.456 --> 0:22:52.367]: 
  Well, ideally.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:53.144 --> 0:22:57.717]: 
  You gotta f- you were fucked, like our bodies fucked, so... Who-who-who corn? Exactly.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:56.940 --> 0:23:24.936]: 
  Zach you can have the shoebox since you fucking don't care. I do care. I'm terrified of dead. I don't want to die Yeah, but you're you're accepting of like a life of dirt so no You can live with a shoebox horrible.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:23.125 --> 0:29:24.812]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:29.554 --> 0:29:31.613]: 
  Wait, you were in a wheelchair? So we still pick up the hand.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:33.824 --> 0:29:34.043]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:13.007 --> 0:30:16.889]: 
  This is the most elaborate sidestep ever to asking if I would...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:16.163 --> 0:30:18.492]: 
  I swear to god, that was my dream.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:17.496 --> 0:30:23.504]: 
  So would would you lose your arm to save my life? Yes? No, not really

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:21.428 --> 0:30:43.450]: 
  No, not really. Well there's your answer. Fair enough, fair enough. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jay. It's alright. But you were losing... But I don't want to lose my hand. But you were losing your hand, your arm, and your leg to fly around in a wheelchair. With superpowers. It's like a rocket powered wheelchair. You're not flying and holding it. Yeah, it was dry.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:37.814 --> 0:30:41.999]: 
  It's like a rocket powered wheelchair. You're flying and holding it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:41.999 --> 0:30:45.644]: 
  Yeah, it was strapped in like a race car

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:45.610 --> 0:31:00.139]: 
  So why were you in a wheelchair before you lost your leg? I had wings. I was flying the wings. That still doesn't answer the question. Why were you in a wheelchair to begin with? This is my fucking dream. I had no legs. I couldn't use crawlers. You had legs though. I had wings.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:57.321 --> 0:30:57.507]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:57.507 --> 0:31:04.324]: 
  Do you feel inherently handicapped somehow like you just need a wheel or did I get

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:03.767 --> 0:31:12.846]: 
  Or did I get the time frame mixed up? No. I had a wheelchair when I had no left. I thought you had a wheelchair before you lost your life. I basically lost this whole half of my body.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:12.846 --> 0:31:19.005]: 
  What if you had wings would you like angel wings or bat wings or some other kind of wings? They were...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:18.364 --> 0:31:29.249]: 
  They were fire dragon wings. Yeah, you have like cool... They were on fire. You have like cool wings, like gin, like devil gin. No, I have like fucking angel wings or something.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:20.069 --> 0:31:21.840]: 
  Yeah, you have like fire

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:25.570 --> 0:31:25.587]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:25.587 --> 0:31:26.447]: 
  You know I had one too.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:29.249 --> 0:31:31.712]: 
  They black or white? Sometimes they're black or white.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:31.425 --> 0:31:39.492]: 
  They were white but they had fire streaks. They had wings in real life. It'd be a bird and you'd wake up and you'd have feathers all over your bed.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:39.492 --> 0:31:49.785]: 
  What were you talking about? What about goat horns? Would you be willing to just have goat horns on your head? Sure. Everybody thought they were cool, but you just couldn't even sleep at night because they were always in the way.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:49.785 --> 0:31:52.283]: 
  You can find a way. What time is it?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:52.283 --> 0:31:54.645]: 
  It's midnight, the hour of the wolf.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:53.211 --> 0:32:05.530]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:26.950 --> 0:35:27.574]: 
  First of all,

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:49.630 --> 0:35:51.925]: 
  He actually did.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:53.089 --> 0:35:54.152]: 
  You feel important.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:54.152 --> 0:35:54.321]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:54.945 --> 0:35:58.439]: 
  You think I could break a brick with my head? I probably could but I could still.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:56.869 --> 0:36:02.826]: 
  Probably could but I could still fuck you. What if he just puts lipstick on? He says, just give daddy a little kiss.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:58.439 --> 0:35:59.856]: 
  Fuck you. What if it's a beer?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:03.535 --> 0:36:04.733]: 
  Chá chá, chá chá!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:04.682 --> 0:36:09.441]: 
  My dad specifically said he wasn't gay. As you fuck you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:09.441 --> 0:36:19.954]: 
  You have to be gay. What? You had that conversation? He was like, listen son, even though you're a product of my balls, I'm not gay. He had to tell you this. Did you accuse him of being gay?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:19.954 --> 0:36:23.228]: 
  You're eating dinner. How's the worst people about gay? Okay?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:23.549 --> 0:36:25.422]: 
  Oh

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:25.439 --> 0:36:52.084]: 
  There are a lot of ways to go with this, so this is the one I wanted to go. So many other ways we could do this. You know what's disgusting about the trombone? I pulled the thing off the front and just this black spit just poured out of it. That's what happens with trombones. You know what, disgusting instrument. I used to have a rusted one, which was like a piece of shit, the one you actually grew up with. It wasn't plastic.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:36.475 --> 0:36:36.930]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:42.027 --> 0:36:42.499]: 
  That's what's going on.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:43.410 --> 0:36:45.284]: 
  You know I used to have a resting this.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:46.650 --> 0:36:46.667]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:51.629 --> 0:36:53.569]: 
  I didn't grow up with the big trombones.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:53.839 --> 0:37:03.492]: 
  So when you grow up with and at the bottom of it they always have black spit because it's a mixture of Damn shit. I love it when they hear this shit. This is disgusting. So when he heard, they were like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:03.492 --> 0:37:07.457]: 
  Where you put your dead fucking you get back to the That roast stuff

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:06.749 --> 0:37:10.461]: 
  Roast up. Can't answer. Don't want to answer, do you? What was it? What was the question?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:06.951 --> 0:37:06.968]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:08.942 --> 0:37:09.702]: 
  What was it?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:09.499 --> 0:37:39.604]: 
  Cory, playtime! Come to daddy! Is this the fuck you saw? Is this the fuck you saw? Is this the fuck you saw? Is this the fuck you saw? Is this the fuck you saw? Is this the scary music? Is your dad approaches you faster and faster? Cory! Come here! This will just run for a long time! That's what Cory does when he's upset about his past. He starts playing the trombone. Hey Cory, remember your dad?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:27.944 --> 0:37:30.002]: 
  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:29.445 --> 0:37:29.496]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:38.710 --> 0:37:41.005]: 
  Bwah-bwah!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:41.005 --> 0:37:56.850]: 
  Anyway, to answer your question, if my dad came down and he was like, worry, what the fuck am I supposed to do? We locked the fucking basement. There's no windows. I guess I'm getting fucked. Would you fight? Nobody said you locked it. Where did that come from? I saw this. I have to, well, I have to escape.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:43.350 --> 0:37:44.076]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:55.821 --> 0:38:02.453]: 
  I have to stop him from escaping because apparently there's windows and escape routes in every single area

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:59.736 --> 0:38:07.026]: 
  in every single scenario. But we were asking how would you talk with it? Yeah, there's also ice cream and every other amenity too. How would you talk with it?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:05.035 --> 0:38:11.177]: 
  I'm like, hey Corey, here's this really interesting scenario. What would you do? I would run away

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:11.177 --> 0:38:18.366]: 
  I'd run away from this situation. This scenario is fucking sick. It's usually me getting raped or murdered. That's because it's funny. You're supposed to come up with an answer. That's not fair.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:15.160 --> 0:38:15.666]: 
  Let's do this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:16.510 --> 0:38:20.222]: 
  I'm supposed to come up with an answer. Is that fair? Would you fight your father or sit and listen?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:20.222 --> 0:38:38.329]: 
  Dude, my dad used to be a bodybuilder. You just take it. Bodybuilder. You wouldn't even attempt to stop him. He built his body. My dad used to take the Arnold Schwarzenegger videos. He used to study them and work out. My mom actually met my dad from being a bodybuilder at a competition. That's how she fell in love with him.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:22.652 --> 0:38:25.791]: 
  You just feel what? So you just take it? Bodybuilding. You wouldn't even a...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:28.272 --> 0:38:28.845]: 
  ماذا يصدقون؟

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:32.794 --> 0:38:33.874]: 
  Oh, you can tell.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:38.464 --> 0:38:39.443]: 
  Do you want a body belt?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:39.443 --> 0:38:58.849]: 
  No. Did she fall in love with him or did she just like how jacked he was? How he could pick up a fucking jackhammer her off the... I shouldn't have said that. That's my mom. I know, yeah. Anyways, I'm gonna talk to him about his mom's. Maybe she just liked how he could pick her up a jackhammer. First of all, back to the story. I'm getting beer, you know? You know Corey.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:49.703 --> 0:38:51.964]: 
  Anyway, we're talking about

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:54.580 --> 0:38:55.694]: 
  First of all...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:58.849 --> 0:39:07.506]: 
  15 minutes ago all you could have said was yeah, and then we would have been on a different topic What was the topic something about your dad raping you but now that?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:01.836 --> 0:39:02.039]:

  Should I tell the story of the family shitter?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:44.009 --> 0:46:52.244]: 
  the Phantom Shitter. Tell the story of the Phantom Shitter. Well, long ago. Star Wars episode 6, the Phantom Shitter.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:51.501 --> 0:47:15.649]: 
  Long time ago when I was in college a few friends of mine living in an apartment and three of us as well as a new guy who we had a Space open and he he there was an opening so he moved in with us to help sort of split up the rent and Three of us were named Jeff as they were saying I kind of went by Jeff to because The other Jeff was much more ripped than I was

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:15.042 --> 0:47:18.417]: 
  Was it just three or was it just two and Jeff and Jeff?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:18.417 --> 0:47:24.154]: 
  The other Jeff, yeah, there was a Jeff 3 that we didn't really know very well either, but we knew.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:23.530 --> 0:47:24.998]: 
  But you all call the Jeff three

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:24.998 --> 0:47:28.913]: 
  Yeah, well now now we just call it just into what you what you?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:28.137 --> 0:47:30.499]: 
  What did you do Jeff, Jeff Junior, Jeff senior?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:30.499 --> 0:47:37.435]: 
  to see your I don't know but this is the story this is the story of the phantom shitter

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:37.435 --> 0:47:38.515]: 
  nochmal weer!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:38.515 --> 0:48:04.182]: 
  the the point of the story is every once in a while we go into the bathroom the toilet seat would be down and we'd lift the toilet seat and it'd be a perfectly formed shit floating on the toilet. What is the deal with it? There was never any toilet paper it was just a big turd floating in the toilet so we think hmm this is interesting and we'd flush it and go about our day but this kept happening over and over continually for weeks we go in any time

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:52.977 --> 0:47:53.247]: 
  두 번째edd

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:04.182 --> 0:48:10.223]: 
  Every time we'd see the toilet seat down we'd be like, there's a fucking turd floating in there, I know it. A load toilet paper.

But then you unravel it or like, oh you and you're in like the bathtub right? And you so you're bored. You just get so excited. I don't take baths, you creep. You put it, you put it, you punch it all up. Just sit in a bathtub. And then you watch it unfold like a flower. Like it's a rose bud that just like pops up. I do. Like the hollow. I know you do. I believe you. You sconce it into a little ball and tuck it into itself and then you just let it go. And then it just unfolds. That was pulled into a penis and ball sack again. Well, I was a kid at the time. You shouldn't retain that knowledge core. You shouldn't, that's not a good bar conversation. That's important people. No. Easily the least important thing you can ever tell anybody ever. Have you ever scratched your wiener up and made it blossom? Have you ever tried to tie your wiener in a knot? I have. My wiener's not long enough. You'd have to be, you'd have to have a pretty long wiener through though. You could tie it in a small, you could like a half knot. I think it's bed, dude. Wait, what were we talking about? I curled it. Pien-penises. Burps. Burps. Burps. That was a perfect type of a burp. I'm tired. Pien-penises. Burps.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:53.522 --> 0:59:59.108]: 
  Sometimes it could be a little a little tariff is a huge if your shit's way too big. Yeah, like you gotta make sure

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:57.555 --> 1:00:11.224]: 
  Yeah, like you gotta make sure, like if you see that you're gonna be on alert next time. It's important. You guys- I have a question. Did you have shits that big where you're like, oh god I might have torn my butthole there. So do not- Michael, what's your question, Joe?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:00.762 --> 1:00:01.724]: 
  Bis zum nächsten Mal.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:03.377 --> 1:00:04.744]: 
  You guys... I have a question.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:03.445 --> 1:00:03.495]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:09.486 --> 1:00:16.945]: 
  What's your question Jeff? You guys just sit and work so long you just wait till it's like a little go for heads popping out and you're like oh my god.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:16.844 --> 1:00:19.662]: 
  See so does I go I watch the better guy

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:19.662 --> 1:00:19.679]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:19.679 --> 1:00:22.412]: 
  The gopher's popping out of his hole.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:21.164 --> 1:01:11.603]: 
  I'm afraid you'll think my underwear. Have you ever been in a toilet and then you bite the shit and somebody goes, Hey! And outside the door you suck it back up and you can't poop anymore? What's kind of... That happened to you? Hey! Look, I should go back to my ass. That exact situation. My dad used to go crazy and screaming by doing it when he was doing it. Just because you knew about it, you'd go for it. Your dad used to fuck with you while you were shit. Ah! You know, I'd be startled. I couldn't poop anymore. For days. That's why you're such an asshole now. Yes, my dad tore my poop habits and it would terrify me. I'd be in my sleep, I'd dream about pooping and wake up and before I could poop, he'd scream at me like, spit out of my face, wait until he'd wake up. To answer Jeff's question, sometimes when I'm working, I feel like I have the shit and I sit on it to pack it. You literally sit on it. I sit on it to pack it down because I know the longer I sit on it, the more satisfying it is. Pack it down?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:31.643 --> 1:00:33.702]: 
  That exact situation.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:37.347 --> 1:00:38.562]: 
  you knew about the gopher head.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:10.439 --> 1:01:10.455]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:10.455 --> 1:01:15.180]: 
  Pack it down! What do you think the poops pile on and condensate? It's like a fucking...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:14.995 --> 1:01:23.500]: 
  I think it's rude people don't give me a warning and they take a massive dump and then I'm like heading towards that bathroom Then nobody says anything and I walk in there and it's just like kidding breathe. I don't

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:23.500 --> 1:01:25.559]: 
  I don't think I've done that before to you yet. No, no, no.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:24.698 --> 1:01:33.945]: 
  No, no, not you. No, nobody here. But somebody like you, you just do like, God, you could have said something. And I have to angrily stand in there, deciding if I'm gonna leave.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:33.945 --> 1:01:36.274]: 
  Hailing people as shit. Yeah, but I'm just gonna like...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:35.768 --> 1:01:40.290]: 
  I'm gonna like, wait another half hour for it to clear out or what? Yeah, I like to...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:39.531 --> 1:01:54.111]: 
  Yeah, I like to... I swear it does, it packs down because if the second you feel like you have to shit and you go shit, you shit like half of shit and it's like oily and weird because I'm an alcoholic. Anyways, if I sit at my desk and I let it pack down...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:52.322 --> 1:01:55.005]: 
  Yeah, what are alcoholic shits like?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:55.005 --> 1:02:35.235]: 
  is oily water they're very oily and they streak the bowl there's some theory for you every time I drink alcohol my fucking it's blows my ass all every time that one night I had those two long islands man my shit was like uh you know you go to a beach and there's like the dirty part of the beach with bones and cigarettes and stuff and dead skeletons of oh yeah it was like black yeah it was like it was like that's the best part of my childhood the beach is in India that I've never been with human skulls and bedding the beach yeah it'll be a bit too there's like a nice beach there's like a back woods area with you know what is your family taking a broken glass and what does that have to do with your bowel movement

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:03.494 --> 1:02:04.472]: 
  Not like a bulls**t.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:16.622]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:16.622 --> 1:02:17.314]: 
  People.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:17.500 --> 1:02:19.440]: 
  Yeah. It was like, it was like. That's the best.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:20.419 --> 1:02:20.504]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:21.449 --> 1:02:22.799]: 
  I've never been here.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:29.954 --> 1:02:29.970]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:29.970 --> 1:02:33.278]: 
  What is your family taking a broken glass?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:34.915 --> 1:02:39.522]: 
  This is like a big analogy right now. I don't like to talk about it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:38.205 --> 1:02:47.453]: 
  I know what you're talking about. It's like the family beach area, then you go over the hill and there's like all these like fucking twigs in shame. You walk out there and they have talk with you. Yeah, you need to talk with like the twigs in shame.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:45.664 --> 1:02:49.444]: 
  Yeah, you would have talked with like the trains in the broken, in the broken left column.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:48.381 --> 1:03:11.399]: 
  Because that area is classified for like you know beach families you're not supposed to go over there That's the not as this relate to Zach taking it because I was saying the gross nasty black I didn't let me finish what my shit was like after I had you're talking about families having picnics in the woods I'm talking about ship black sand I think they cast 11 and some kid that boy walked in and kicked it down and knocked it over I didn't know what to do

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:53.849 --> 1:02:54.456]: 
  How does this work?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:00.396 --> 1:03:00.885]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:01.982 --> 1:03:03.501]: 
  It makes it in the woods. It has a lot of sense.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:03.501 --> 1:03:05.374]: 
  I'm talking about shipwramming.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:10.994 --> 1:03:14.942]: 
  Are any of you those guys that get so proud of your shit you want to take a picture?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:14.942 --> 1:03:26.637]: 
  I have never had so much like when I run into people who are like do-do-do the biggest shit It's like who cares? Well, I'm shocked you guys are so proud of your shit so you have to look at everything you've ever done

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:17.423 --> 1:03:18.250]: 
  I don't really...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:21.203 --> 1:03:21.540]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:26.586 --> 1:03:30.940]: 
  Sometimes you go, oh, yeah. It's bad. Yeah, but what about?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:28.847 --> 1:03:33.944]: 
  Have you ever taken a shit and then it just won't go down or you're scared it won't go down?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:30.940 --> 1:03:30.957]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:33.235 --> 1:03:40.474]: 
  You're scared it won't go down? Kind of proud like you kind of had a kid, but you can't tell anybody. You're like, yeah, good. I have it a little blanket. Have you ever, have you ever did that? Have you ever had a kid?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:37.032 --> 1:03:51.139]: 
  Yeah, good. Have you ever had a little blanket? Have you ever did that? Have you ever had a shit where a lot came out and you're like, wow, it was impressive. And then you turn around and you flush it and you're like, oh shit, it won't go down. It's suffering. The water won't push it down. And then the water pushes it down.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:47.511 --> 1:03:49.064]: 
  is afraid the water will push it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:51.089 --> 1:03:58.547]: 
  It seems like sometimes your body just decides, I'm gonna hold everything back for one special day and then you have quadruple of the amount you're supposed to.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:57.636 --> 1:04:07.997]: 
  you're supposed to have you ever eaten like oh my god saying amounts of foods over the course of like three days you know like you're like where did it go like what's a blocky

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:59.830 --> 1:04:01.416]: 
  and you're like, oh my god.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:03.644 --> 1:04:09.415]: 
  and you're like, where did it go? Like what's happening? It's like a blockage and then it decides. That's what I'm talking about.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:08.706 --> 1:04:24.096]: 
  That's what I'm talking about. You just go down for a classic shit and then you sit down. Classic shit. There's so much of that. A little fashion shit like a Nintendo shit. Then you sit down there for like 30 minutes and you get up and you're like, oh my god, I hope it's not touching the top. It's almost like... And it's not.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:12.874 --> 1:04:13.448]: 
  Sit down.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:13.448 --> 1:04]: 
  I'm so glad to get it. There's so much.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04 --> 1:04:15.895]: 
  with thatлам

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:22.274 --> 1:04:29.445]: 
  It's almost like the way a volcano forms out of the ocean all of a sudden like this this master is coming out of the water

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:29.445 --> 1:04:44.363]: 
  Yeah, and you're afraid it won't flush because there's not water in the garden. It's scary, you're like, oh my god. You know, my worst fear is like, it doesn't flush. That is my worst fear. That is my worst fear. It's going to toilet and then like flushing it and the water doesn't go down. You're just like the pressure is falling. Yeah, then you have to get some water.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:32.044 --> 1:04:38.457]: 
  It's scary, you're like, oh my god, you know, my worst fear is like, that lady doesn't flush, and then I have to tell somebody.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:42.979 --> 1:04]: 
  If you get somebody else to look at you like I don't did

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04 --> 1:04:46.624]: 
  Do.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:46.624 --> 1:04:48.075]: 
  The real question is...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:48.075 --> 1:05:05.322]: 
  That's why you gotta drink more because your poop just turns into liquid and it all goes down and you're good to go I guess this is a good point to me The real question is, what is the weight period before you can sit down and say your asshole doesn't feel so good? Because you know what I mean? Have you ever taken a shit and sat down at your chair somewhere else and you just feel, you know what I mean? Is there a weight period for you?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:53.138 --> 1:04:53.948]: 
  I guess this is gonna real quick.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:03.921 --> 1:05:09.962]: 
  The worst part is sitting on a toilet and my legs fall asleep and then I almost fall down when I stand up again.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:09.659 --> 1:06:44.496]: 
  That's because you're playing Tetris and shit in there. I'm not! Alright, maybe I am a little bit, but so what? Do you ever like, when you take it to shit, like you take your, like since your pants are around your ankles, you pull one leg out of your pants so you can get a better stance on the toilet like this and you have to like, lean like that? Oh yeah, have you ever spread your ass when you couldn't shit? Like you really couldn't push the shit out when you thought you had to spread your ass to a stand? No, I was thinking when it was shown. No, like, like you were... It doesn't help your asshole muscle. Your brain is like thinking like, maybe if I spread my ass it would come out faster, but nothing changes so you just kind of do yours less, not helping, so you just kind of like, you push a little bit, and then eventually it comes out and it's just like this tiny clot that had like this... I do that placebo effect thing where I just like a squat for and I push on my stomach thinking that's bad. Oh my god, you mean, you push your stomach and it's disgusting, stammer. Ew. You're trying to like fucking make like a machine, trying to like put like a baby bird eating its food. Let me ask you something, Zach, when you wake up in the morning and you brush your teeth, how do you get the toothpaste out of the tube, dumbass? Well, push my fucking stomach and the poop comes out. You squeeze the toothpaste tube and it comes out, you brush your teeth and you talk to cute ladies. Have you guys ever had one of those toilets where the rim is loose and you try to adjust your ass and your whole fucking body goes to the spew? Do you know when you go to those fucking like toilets and then like some toilets are really fucking wide? It does get my question. When you go to a public restaurant, when you go to a public restroom and you sit down in the toilet, it's just too fucking big and you just feel really awkward.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:13.742 --> 1:05:14.451]: 
  Sorry.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:14.451 --> 1:05:14.670]: 
  Damn.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:26.145 --> 1:05:26.635]: 
  Oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:32.389 --> 1:05:32.575]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:32.575 --> 1:05:34.499]: 
  I was thinking of cartoons.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:34.499 --> 1:05:36.827]: 
  I don't think I helped.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:47.729 --> 1:05:49.500]: 
  You push a little bit and eventually...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:52.302 --> 1:05:53.399]: 
  I do that with seabulls.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:57.398 --> 1:06:01.448]: 
  Oh my god, man, that's the good. I'm disgusting. Stay up real.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:23.065 --> 1:06:23.149]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:34.844 --> 1:06:35.535]: 
  It's like what?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:44.496 --> 1:06:48.445]: 
  You guys don't even have to fucking worship it. I went over to South Korea to visit

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:48.445 --> 1:07:02.654]: 
  My brother and he's uh, they have these all the center hole on the floor. Yeah, the ones where you have to squat I actually feel like this one. I don't know. It scares me even look at him because the a they don't even have toilet paper And you have to get them off dudes off the street. Yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:54.570 --> 1:06:54.807]: 
  X

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:54.807 --> 1:06:55.448]: 
  I just feel like this one's...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:55.448 --> 1:06:56.427]: 
  I know that's my sister.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:00.494 --> 1:07]: 
  Get a 후�appy.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07 --> 1:07:01.017]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:01.658 --> 1:07:06.501]: 
  Yeah, you have to bring your own or not have any and it's like B. I don't know

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:06.501 --> 1:07:12.947]: 
  It's just they're died over there, but they assume they're you're just gonna have a perfectly formed like five inch along turd That's gonna jet

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:12.947 --> 1:07:18.449]: 
  gently drop into this little canal and then beautifully slide away.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:18.449 --> 1:07:33.214]: 
  get up and like that's it but not you know these terrible American shit where it's just like all over it's like a fucking disaster it's a good terrible disaster this was he was he never got out of that one that's grown in cheese in your stomach i don't even

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:21.604 --> 1:07:22.667]: 
  American shit to it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:29.789 --> 1:07:42.951]: 
  This is what you get for going out of the TX hole. You're throwing in cheese in your stomach. I don't even understand. And then the hotel I was in, they actually had American toilet, but it was covered in electronic buttons. And I was just like, well, of course, for some reason. I don't know. It wasn't surprised.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:42.951 --> 1:10:32.697]: 
  I'll be the first person to say it. Have you ever been so sick that you had the shit in the bathtub? No. No. Where you're sitting and you're squatting on your hands and knees like a fucking... Oh my god. Like a wild animal. What is it filled with water? Are you just... You're saying you're in the bathtub, Lay, and shitting in the water, polluting your water. Yeah! Yeah, that's what I'm doing. I'm shitting in the bathtub water. Just because it's a bathtub doesn't mean there's not a shower running. You're laying in the bathtub while shitting and polluting your own water. Dumbass! What are you... The drain is open and the shower's coming down and you're shitting in the bathtub because you can't fucking move because of food poisoning or because you're... I'm shitting in the toilet. You're risking the... What did you say to the shit? You're gonna actually probably push the shit down the drain like it's Play-Doh. Yeah, with my foot. Thank you. But it... I'm done talking to you. But no, that's not the point. I'm horrified. I'm horrified. The holes in the Korean toilets are the most optimum way of shitting because the way you squat, then you don't get like shit. That's assuming you don't have like a watery shit or like rabbit pellet shit or anything. Yeah, but the way your legs bend, your butt cheeks spread and shit comes straight out of your butt hole. Yeah, if you're a cute little Asian guy who has like a perfect diet and you shit regularly every day and your shit comes out like 5.2 inches and you walk away. What's the fun of shitting? I don't know, I'm just saying. You're saying you're a holy fuddy chaser. Did you bring a tape measure to South Korea? You look at one of those things and you tell me there isn't a real fear in your eyes that they can overflow at your fucks. A real fear. And then there's no toilet paper and you have to just pull your pants up, put white wails through, pull up your shitty pants and go home. Every time I go to South Korea I make it my duty to shit in every fucking year at all. Or whatever the fuck. You don't even want to eat when you're over there. It's so scary. People just shitting. The way I see it is like even if you're an obese guy versus an obese guy using the hole in the... You're still getting a cleaner result because you're squatting and shitting. That's possible. And it's not like getting all over your butt cheeks because you're just sitting down. That might be true. What about like... You just licked your ass. Is this like the ones in Japan where you fucking squat like this? Exactly. I'm more scared because it's splattering all over the ground and just like... That's what I'm afraid of. What happens if you have a really splash of shit and it fucking hits up? People used to be like a porta-potty. And as you control how hard you put... You go in the bathroom and go... And just shoot out. No, like if you can't control like the density and the fucking speed at which shit hits the ground... Yes you can. It's called your anus. No, it's called inertia and gravity when it hits the ground. An object emotion station motion. All right Bill Knight, the shit guy fucking gave me fucking shit tips on inertia and gravity with shit coming out.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:51.405 --> 1:07:52.283]: 
  Bye!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:20.819 --> 1:08:21.122]:

  I'm gonna say it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:05.993 --> 1:09:11.511]: 
  You're so conspiracy. Did you bring a tape measure to South Korea?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:22.006 --> 1:09:26.006]: 
  Pull your pants up, put white wheels through, pull up your shits pants and go home.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:32.419 --> 1:09:33.111]: 
  We're over there.

  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:57.090 --> 1:10:02.609]: 
  Exactly! I'm more scared because it's splattering all over the ground and just like... That's what I'm afraid of!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:05.005 --> 1:10:07.941]: 
  It's up because to be like a porta-party

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:23.483 --> 1:10:24.968]: 
  Oh, she wants more

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:32.612 --> 1:10:35.835]: 
  This is the first time I've ever heard Corey talk about gravity and science.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:35.430 --> 1:10:42.923]: 
  Listen, you talk about the gravity and inertia of shit coming out of your eyes. Spray shit into a hole. Listen, it's important to know these things. Cory.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:38.063 --> 1:10:38.890]: 
  coming out of your way.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:38.822 --> 1:10:38.856]: 
  you
