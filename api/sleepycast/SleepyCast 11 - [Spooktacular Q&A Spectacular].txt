Buried deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little cabin. And in that cabin... Is a bunch of guys, is a bunch of bullshitter.

  I'm not a degenerate. I don't know what to think. I don't say.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:51.062 --> 0:01:57.340]: 
  Honestly, that's one of those loaded questions where it's kind of like there's really nothing you could do when you were a kid That's really that because I

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:56.918 --> 0:02:01.947]: 
  No, because I guarantee you there's stuff you think you think back on, you go, oh my god. I mean, there's stuff I did when I was...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:00.614 --> 0:02:06.452]: 
  I mean, there's stuff I did when I was a kid that I would like smack myself. But there's like the truth, the recall that you did

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:06.452 --> 0:02:09.929]: 
  It makes you kind of shudder. Oh God. I do.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:08.595 --> 0:02:09.050]: 
  I do.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:09.929 --> 0:02:33.047]: 
  It's honestly the silliest most like not big deal ever, but every time I think of it I just want to kill myself What Chris? I was in school and I had a little iron giant figurine and I was playing with it on my desk And I remember specifically saying the words I was imagining in my head A made-up character that he was talking to and I said out loud I will kill you invisible and two fucking girls looked at me and they started laughing at me

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:16.324 --> 0:02:16.965]: 
  What, Chris?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:34.060 --> 0:03:49.947]: 
  It was the most embarrassing moment. That makes you want to kill yourself? It makes me want to kill myself. Look at that story, two out of ten. Help me. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe ten or eight. I have a story. It was yesterday. What year? What's that you have? I had a pencil sharpener. And I was a kid, right? I tried sharpening a crayon. And I clogged the pencil sharpener with crayon. And then I blamed my brother. And my parents, I think my dad, spanked my brother. And the end, I got to do it. Dad's a dickhead. What the fuck? No, my brother deserved it anyway. Wait, you want to die because of that? Yes. That's that big of a denture on your head. I don't know. This is a stupid question. Fine. That's a question. I'll be realistic. You know, you don't be. I have a question. I didn't give you mine. I didn't give you mine. I have a question. What's that? My friend had a dog who was crazy. We used to jump on the trampoline and pretend to be super sands because we were faggots. He sounded like him. So, and I started to go, when you were a kid, you have so much energy. And like, one time the dog got super horny. And so we used to have like, we used to battle each other on the fucking trampoline to a point where we'd throw each other off into the dog den. And whoever landed would be fucking fucked by the dog. You know, and I.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:39.375 --> 0:02:40.219]: 
  He only

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:44.235 --> 0:02:45.940]:

  I have a question.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:19.994 --> 0:03:21.074]: 
  I have a question.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:28.887 --> 0:03:30.338]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:48.006 --> 0:03:55.448]:

  I was much older than I should be for you to understand that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:54.814 --> 0:04:56.451]:

  What did you do in life? You like looked at me like I'm far away. Am I the only normal? I mean, Chris and I are the only normal ones here, so. Jeff, you pissed the fat human adult. Jeff asked me something a normal person would think. Asked me something a normal person would think. Yeah, a normal person would say it. Think. Pretend to be a normal person. Say a few things like you would think a normal person would say. OK, I have to get started, dude. Holy shit. So look, your first fucking human was. The first thing that came to my head was the weather outside is right.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:03.276 --> 0:06:03.630]: 
  Yeah, she's leaving.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:03.985 --> 0:06:05.453]:

  Bye.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:27.576 --> 0:06:29.601]: 
  The first thing they do is

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:32.419 --> 0:06:55.994]: 
  It's not something anybody would say Chloe, it's something you maniac like you would say. No fucking person would walk up to you and say the weather outside is bright and fucking running in their direction. There's somebody quoting a fucking 50 year old song to you. You're insane, Corey. Hey, you know, I saw a guy while yesterday who said Frosty, the snowman, I was like, God, that guy's normal, that's fine. That makes total sense. That's not why people greet you either with fucking Christmas songs in the 70s.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:45.447 --> 0:06:46.004]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:55.994 --> 0:07:38.502]: 
  Imagine you're in an office. You're an accountant. Your paperwork. And I come up to you, I'm like, Cory, I mean, we need these accountant things done by noon. Can you do it? Cory, I would not. I would not. What's the interest? What's the interest on the loan? I would probably look at the number that says interest. We have to figure it out. Do you have a calculator? Beep, beep, pull out my phone. Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. That's 42%. Thank you. Is one of those tomagachi things that makes sounds like that? Okay, so that's why we would kill each other. Okay, someone else. SimtheGeezer asks, did you ever consider quitting animation at one point? Like settling to be an accountant or some job other than animating?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:05.764 --> 0:07:06.659]: 
  I would

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:17.627 --> 0:07:18.066]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:20.024 --> 0:07:22.454]: 
  42% Thank you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:24.900 --> 0:07:25.373]: 
  So that's a

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:26.166 --> 0:07:27.820]: 
  That answers the question.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:26.504 --> 0:07:26.993]: 
  This is the question.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:38.502 --> 0:07:44.459]: 
  Oh my god, well I think you're not gonna be able to start with Why don't we start with the first one Let's go down the way

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:41.489 --> 0:08:15.390]: 
  start with why we started pure as well. Let's go down the way. That's a really weird, yeah, it actually did happen. There was a point where me and my parents, well this is before I even pretty much, you know, uploaded to even, I don't know, like even Newgrounds or anything. This is at a point where I, like, I couldn't prove that I could ever make success out of it and to be fair, you do gotta be lucky to make money from like. It's true, there's a lot that you bank on. I can definitely see where my mom and dad were coming from when they were like, you should probably just kind of, you know, train for something else just in case. At the time I was like, no!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:56.119 --> 0:07:56.440]: 
  years.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:06.565 --> 0:08:07.392]: 
  It's a lot of luck.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:15.390 --> 0:08:15.998]: 
  The water!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:15.998 --> 0:08:18.276]: 
  I'm gonna be fucking animator. And then...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:17.719 --> 0:08:42.491]: 
  And then we had big fights and it was just like, you know what, that's it. I fucking give up. I never want to do this again. There's too much effort. There's too much fighting with my smelly, beautiful parents that I still love. Yeah, surely you voted to quit though as like after you voted you started. There's been at least probably one point where you voted to quit, right? No. If I wasn't doing animation, I'd have to be working in my dad's shop. I hated working in the shop. It takes a lot of patience to find out.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:42.491 --> 0:08:47.925]: 
  fucking deal with like oh flash crash I lost all the work oh that's fine I guess we have to keep doing this

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:47.925 --> 0:08:50.727]: 
  At one point you said you were going to go back to your college.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:50.659 --> 0:08:59.772]: 
  you know i yeah there's been a couple points where i was like fuck this i have just so done with this i'd rather i'd rather go back in because sometimes i think i it's too much effort to go to college or something

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:59.772 --> 0:10:16.958]: 
  I'll tell you this much, I actually went to school for illustration and graphic design and that was actually like somewhat, if you just replace animation with illustration I basically went from illustration to animation because I quit illustration because it was so fucking difficult. It got so hard at some point I just, I eventually quit and I actually begged to work in an animation studio. Really? Yeah. And that actually went from working on like an animated TV show called VH1 Illustrated for a few years and then I lost that job. I don't know, now I'm working on Newgrounds doing like video game stuff. So I don't know, it's weird. Yeah, I went from basically oil painting to digital animation. So, Corey. If you were to quit completely just because you're so frustrated, you thought about saying fucking... Well, I guess for me, my mom always encouraged me to do what I enjoy. She's like, if you're in that situation then you're better off than most people so you should pursue that. So my mom always encouraged it. But my dad was against it. All the way. Yeah. He wanted you to be a professional weightlifter. You wanted me... That's actually true. That's actually true. Really? My mom met my dad when he was taking, like he was going to professional like lifting, like weight things where they like lift stuff in like huge lines. Like a concentration camp lines and shit. Like I'm telling you. With both of them.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:19.499 --> 0:09:20.815]: 
  Really? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:19.515 --> 0:09:19.583]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:33.201 --> 0:09:33.252]:

My parents, like, weren't against me being an artsy or whatever. Like, they always encouraged me to do on-slope. They used to fucking beat you, dude. They did not. They used to fucking beat you with your art pencils. Birdie with solder yards. Like, they never... they were never against art. They just, like, wanted me to kind of have a backup line in case it failed. Which is totally fair. You said you didn't put cigarettes on you. Like, you'd walk and be like, my little ass tray, and he puts it down in your face and put... But you're like drawing a fancy fucking like birdie and you're like... Yeah, but it wasn't that bad.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:34.480 --> 0:31:39.120]: 
  Yeah, they'd be working at Walmart. Yeah. I'd be at the Billy Lee's. I'd be at the schizophrenics. I'd be at the other side.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:36.218 --> 0:31:40.504]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:51.119 --> 0:31:51.726]: 
  Oh, I mean...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:55.709 --> 0:31:59.438]: 
  Here's a lot of them saw a formula that worked it just

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:59.438 --> 0:32:27.940]: 
  Did that. So in conclusion. Don't be a lazy cunt. Work challenge yourself and do something besides playing games on YouTube. Thank you. JJ Awesome77 writes, what is a movie you guys think deserves a reboot? I like the movie The Wraith. It's like The Fast and the Furious with sci-fi and I think it should be remade. Thank you. There are a lot of movies that I think actually work well and rebooted. Like someone that's sort of, it's like you never need to reboot like Total Recall. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:08.972 --> 0:32:10.609]: 
  The Spurri Jeff? You guys think.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:19.367 --> 0:32:19.992]: 
  д Chase

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:27.012 --> 0:32:27.332]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:27.940 --> 0:32:43.482]: 
  There's some series that I was like, oh, they've been dead for a long time. So why not reboot them like a player the apes They tried to reboot that series in 2001 with Mark Wahlberg and it fucking blew Yeah, and actually did a better job with the reboot and actually the reboot I think is on par with the original if not better. I'd say at least on par at least

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:43.482 --> 0:32:47.498]: 
  Which movie no, they need to play the apes. Oh plan of the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:47.498 --> 0:32:50.282]: 
  the first plate like the 69 68 version whichever

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:50.282 --> 0:34:10.995]: 
  came out. I love that movie but the reboot I think is very well done. Outside of the guy, the corporate guy who's unnecessarily evil and greedy. Yeah, the second one I think was better than the first one. Yeah, it was. Yeah. They've learned how to improve. Your answer was... Oh, The Wraith. It's a movie where a kid gets killed and he comes back. It's not even clear. He comes back as like a ghost alien. You're not even sure what he is, but he drives his black dodge. He was murdered by like a gang of dudes who race cars. That sounds like pumpkin. They bully people. They basically find a dude with a nice car and they're like, listen, I'm gonna race you for your fucking, for your pink slip, for your car. And then they beat him and they fucking take his car and drive away and leave the dude and his girlfriend out on like some country road without a car. And they do this to everybody in town, but then they kill this kid and he comes back as a ghost alien in a black car. And he races them and he basically, he kills them. He... I'm not explaining this very well. He basically races them. I can't understand it. He races them and then he gets ahead of them and he turns around and comes back and crashes onto them, into the head on and kills them. And then his car flies into a million parts and it comes back together and then he drives off. And then it does it to the next guy. That's cool. It is a cool movie. Did you guys ever see They Live? Yeah. I think that movie would be interesting if it was rebooted just because it's such a bizarre movie. It's so fucking strange. Yeah, no, it would work. Like even

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:57.218 --> 0:33:00.323]: 
  Yeah, the second one I think was better than the first one. Yeah, it was.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:52.770 --> 0:33:53.344]: 
  and head on.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:03.857 --> 0:34:04.229]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:10.995 --> 0:34:36.004]: 
  Just just moves that nobody's ever heard of the kind of I mean people for that movie. It's just but it's more those more bizarre You can't really what you can't say a movie is like they live what what can you say is like that movie? Exactly, it's just so bizarre and so out there if they took that to a new audience avoid his dog is a movie like that once again It has nothing else like it So if they if they did stuff with the material and they did something interesting with it I could see myself watching but what I see people

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:17.955 --> 0:36:17.288]: 
  Okay, so it's like how about like pointless reboots like to me I'm still baffled by The spider-man reboot they did it like three or four years after it's like money But it's the same fucking story the only reason they did it with the key Yeah, it makes money The only reason they did it was so that um if they didn't make those movies they would have lost the rights to Yeah Same thing with the Fantastic Four. That's a weird movie Fantastic Four was awful. I don't I don't understand the appeal but this new movie has been really weird Like that you've seen a few behind-the-scenes shots of it And it's it's like the studio is afraid to show it off. They're like ashamed of it or something The newest one. Yeah, the newest one not the silver shirt. I never saw it so no one's coming out It actually makes those look good. Are you fucking serious? The first one was awful. Yeah, like dreadful The the new one you should look up pictures of they have a picture of dr. Doom. He looks like a homeless man on Green it's all like green screen. I don't even know what's out. I don't even know the hell's happening

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:33.599 --> 0:44:34.814]: 
  Ya can't go a ton...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:51.182 --> 0:44:52.499]: 
  Give the people in general.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:58.337 --> 0:44:58.945]: 
  Like if you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:06.758 --> 0:45:06.994]: 
  here.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:06.994 --> 0:45:08.547]: 
  a drum over and over again.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:10.335 --> 0:45:13.069]: 
  There's never a point where any artist just stops.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:12.462 --> 0:45:52.489]: 
  People always learning something they always like well especially for me when I first started like drawing girls It honestly took probably about 10,000 tries It's honestly girl and I mean before it looked okay It's like when you first when you first get in the girl anatomy you're like oh guys are just boxes Do you look at girls? You're just like what the fuck from the other side like her vacious and yeah I remember the feeling of drawing it like ten times in a row and still looking like shit It's been like man fuck like why am I even trying this is bullshit But if you just keep on doing it you will get better. Yeah, if you give up after trying once and failing There's there's yeah, then we do something. Yeah, if you want to do something and you keep like failing at it That's gonna happen. Mm-hmm. That's even if you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:13.980 --> 0:45:14.453]: 
  The old

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:22.064 --> 0:45:25.152]: 
  It's honestly before it looked okay

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:31.395 --> 0:45:33.859]: 
  I just remember that feeling.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:46.043 --> 0:45:47.747]: 
  you should be doing something to dealing with.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:52.489 --> 0:46:10.562]: 
  You suck. Keep doing it. By the way, people always say this too about cartoons, they say, oh, I can't put on cartoons, I keep perfecting it. Just put something out. You make a 10-second cartoon. Don't start off with a 10-minute cartoon. That's your fucking magnum opus. You're not going to do that. Put on a 5-second cartoon. Then a 10-second cartoon. The 20 seconds, then a minute, and so on and so on.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:10.107 --> 0:46:11.609]: 
  You eventually get faster and...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:11.490 --> 0:46:12.435]: 
  Et pute, je suis là, parce que...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:12.435 --> 0:46:55.669]: 
  you put shit out get critiqued then you'll figure out what's wrong with your stuff and you'll get better from there I've got two pieces of advice I would like to give out okay the first piece of advice is that you can't start being good You have to you literally have to rip off shit to begin with like you like you have to To learn good colors you pretty much look at a picture with nice colors And you fucking eyedropper that you look at the colors. I mean you draw inspiration You don't directly like plagiarize. No, yeah, yeah like no, but I don't play dry No, no don't like that that was the second piece of it like of advice is like While you're doing that don't release anything while you're doing that learn from it while you're doing that and then once you found your Style then release your shit. Yeah, or what's people will call you out and make you you will get caught out

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:20.080 --> 0:46:20.502]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:38.136 --> 0:46:40.634]: 
  No, yeah, yeah, like, no, but like... Don't plagiarize.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:53.020 --> 0:46:53.273]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:54.674 --> 0:46:57.525]: 
  You will get caught, you will get caught, you're looking at an idiot.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:57.087 --> 0:47:41.772]: 
  But yeah, like for a while just kind of like look at people's ideas and steal them But keep them on your hair, but don't release them Yeah, steal all their stuff and then like trace it right no don't Don't trace their name and write your name But like what the how I learned colors was I fucking looked at art that I liked and I stole their colors And now I know how to do it myself Yeah I mean that's that's just like color theories and like how you like like you know like if you look at Aaron's stuff Back then there was like a game called maple story it used a lot of that style colors and when you look at it Then again though there is people who will just flat out rip off a color palette. Oh, yeah Yeah, no, no, yeah, but there's like you can see there's like drawing inspiration and getting like color theories and stuff Then there's just like directly stealing a screenshot from something it does

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:07.634 --> 0:47:09.962]: 
  So don't stress it. Write down their name and write your name with the plan.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:16.797 --> 0:47:17.303]: 
  because I...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:32.845 --> 0:47:33.807]: 
  Oh yeah, yeah, no.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:37.789 --> 0:47:38.160]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:41.654 --> 0:47:43.493]: 
  Will you use somebody else's

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:43.493 --> 0:48:36.059]: 
  colors you see a back-to-back you see like the hair next to the skin you look at it you something clicks and you're ready go oh that looks good with that color okay you find yourself only when you find yourself then release your shit don't release shit that's clearly ripped off the one color you're allowed to rip off is a skin skin tone yeah skin tones and that's another thing that people think that like ownership is always it's like come on man there is so much different color tones like I've seen like you look at artists like what's a really cool code and you you like you're curious like you said you take the picture you I drop it and you're like this is like fucking gray red what the hell exactly but it looks good so yeah so it's like sometimes exactly you shouldn't be afraid to experiment either like I know a lot of people use like default colors and shit and if you see something you're like you know what I want to make the fucking sunset pink it's like fucking do it and then make the color

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:52.622 --> 0:47:54.411]: 
  Yeah, all I'm saying is fine.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:58.664 --> 0:47:59.204]: 
  That's all.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:03.372 --> 0:48:04.570]: 
  Yes, get to it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:08.147 --> 0:48:09.430]: 
  He's just like, come on, man. You're recording to get right.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:16.045 --> 0:48:16.332]: 
  Thank you sir.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:20.820 --> 0:48:21.293]: 
  now.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:22.137 --> 0:48:24.330]: 
  Yeah, so it's like sometimes you can...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:35.586 --> 0:48:40.007]: 
  The Simpsons are fucking yellow and the trees are that short purple. It doesn't matter. We're doing it with the fucking water.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:39.214 --> 0:49:31.172]: 
  It doesn't look good, but also I'm not just talking about art either though I'm also talking to like anything like How I learned music was I got mid-eye files from fucking the internet I put them into my music software I looked at how the notes complement each other and that's how I learned music yeah So if you just look at other people's work you'll learn from it and then just draw and draw and draw anything you fucking see and you'll Get good at I buy a lot of art books. Yeah, inspiration. Do you yeah? I got a shit ton of our books I I get art books and it's like I kind of get them in a splurge like oh man I'm vacationing like yeah when I was over at like errands and stuff if I'm like there and then we go out I spend like a ton of money on some fucking art books and they just sit in my room collect dust and hide spider webs like I don't use them. They're just there for decoration I feel like I could probably get more out if I used them, but it's definitely something I'd like to

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:54.604 --> 0:48:54.705]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:06.096 --> 0:49:07.530]: 
  I got a shit ton of air books.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:07.497 --> 0:49:07.514]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:12.711 --> 0:49:13.065]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:32.033 --> 0:51:53.952]: 
  Look more into but then again, there's like the Internet's just full of images You can just look at and be like wow, that's fucking cool. Yeah the image that I download the most of backgrounds. I think backgrounds Yeah, and that's no anything character related. That's another thing too Like I learned this because I used to rely on getting other people to do like backgrounds and stuff for me And I've realized after like doing backgrounds that it's like backgrounds aren't a crucial part of your cartoon Because it's like you can have a character in a white background But it's way more interesting to have like a nice backdrop and if you know like color theories and stuff It could bring a cartoon more to life than it already did even if you have flat cartoons flat colors, but a nice contrast background It's also one thing about color. Mm-hmm If you're having trouble with color just color it the closest you can take a screenshot bring it This is what I did bring into Photoshop, you know slide it around tint the whole thing a certain color Sometimes it helps if you if you have a detailed drawing sometimes just going into Photoshop and Exporting it is like an eight-color GIF Reducing the colors down sort of like makes the whole thing jive a little bit better together Like it's sort of not the best out of the best word for it is but it it on you know It uncomplicates it so it's like bit mat tracing and flash Where you just like you knock out you leave like the main yeah, yeah Replaces a bunch of sub more similar colors of one color and it sort of oh feels like it makes the design a little stronger It's just one idea to because then you could like learn like oh wow So like gray blue works really well like this orangeish color. Yeah, yeah I would just throw in like I throw color overlays on top of things just just messing around experiment Yeah, just experiment that's better than going into flash and like single handedly just choose changing every color one at a time You don't have to have like the the fucking red bland ass red and yellow crayons you get Yeah, like you don't you need like macaroni yellow and like orange carrot You can get like fucking orange yellow and like Orange green and yellow green and learning complementary colors also is really nice too because you start to realize that a lot of colors contrast Good together during the sunsets and like dark nights and shit. This is a huge color conversation Life advice life advice Little things challenge yourself. Don't be lazy. Don't make excuses. You leave your laundry on Sunday You don't have the time to do things you have the time advice just like it

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:37.180 --> 0:49:37.669]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:42.495 --> 0:49:43.339]: 
  And that's another

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:44.672 --> 0:49:44.689]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:13.815 --> 0:50:15.199]: 
  They might call her

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:32.682 --> 0:50:32.985]: 
  Oh.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:48.595 --> 0:50]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50 --> 0:50:49.455]: 
  Just yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:56.273 --> 0:50:58.028]: 
  But it's just one idea to...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:03.360 --> 0:51:05.234]: 
  Yeah, yeah, I just...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:09.959 --> 0:51:10.195]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:11.511 --> 0:51:12.524]: 
  easier than going into flat.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:15.983 --> 0:51:16.455]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:22.024 --> 0:51:22.564]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:33.887 --> 0:51:34.242]: 
  because he's...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:39.017 --> 0:51:39.355]: 
  130.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:41.160 --> 0:51:42.375]: 
  Do you guys like it?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:44.384 --> 0:51:44.704]: 
  little

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:46.611 --> 0:51:46.915]: 
  believe

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:53.952 --> 0:51:57.377]: 
  advice.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:57.377 --> 0:52:00.617]: 
  Just seeing stuff is, do your laundry once a week, don't let a fucking pile up its head.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:00.617 --> 0:52:07.114]: 
  It's such a small thing. Don't wait for all your laundry to be ready to wash and then wash it. It's a horrible idea.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:07.064 --> 0:52:08.144]: 
  That's what I do.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:08.144 --> 0:52:11.873]: 
  It's such a bad idea to switch games and just do your laundry once a week.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:11.873 --> 0:52:24.006]: 
  How much you had just do it and it's done if you're renting an apartment It's a good idea clean because you never know when some dickhead is gonna show up and want to inspect your apartment And you're like, oh, sorry. Sorry make my kitchen is a fucking disaster

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:14.489 --> 0:52:15.248]: 
  It's a good idea.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:19.129 --> 0:52:19.804]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:23.702 --> 0:52:29.524]: 
  In general, do stuff as you go, do it for a dull pile up. So if you clean your room as you go every day.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:27.938 --> 0:53:16.099]: 
  Oh, that's true. It's, it's, sorry, I didn't interrupt you, but it's like... I mean, I don't really know how to do my taxes. I was gonna say taxes. Taxes? Taxes are like writing checks and stuff. Dude, that's a necessity of living. If you live and you're a human being and you pay more than 12 grand or whatever the fucking prerequisite for paying taxes is, you better do your... It blows my mind they don't have a fucking class in school teaching you this thing. That's it! I know! I was talking to my fucking parents about that and I'm like, can you explain to me why we're learning how to, we're learning, I mean, no offense, but we're learning about shit like fucking social studies and they're like, you have to know this stuff. And then you get to fucking college and the stuff they're teaching you, like, your pre-college classes, it's like, this is how you do college work, yada yada, stupid shit, fold your books this way, like a Melvin, and it's like, hey, where's the fucking taxes class? How do you do this shit? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:35.492 --> 0:59:14.153]: 
  Like, there's fucking smashes in this building. It actually knocks it over. It's like, they're trying to sell things to pour your drink. So like some adult is trying to pour milk out of a carton. It's pouring all over the floor. They can't get it in the glass. Yeah, it's like, it just blows my mind that it's like, you know what I mean? People aren't stupid. If they actually need something, you can kind of show it. Like, when people see that, they're not. People are stupid. Yeah, but when people see that, they're like, I can pour a glass of milk. Fuck you. Yeah, but when it's only 1999, shipping included. Why not? Yeah, but what kind of guys like, I guess I wasn't thinking about the disabled. The worst?

  Yeah, but one of the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:03.994 --> 0:59:04.163]: 
  It's all right.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:14.153 --> 0:59:26.910]: 
  If you've seen Wikipedia's definition of Down syndrome, it's not funny, but the picture there is like a guy with Down syndrome with a big smile on his face, he has a big hammer, and he's smashing a piece of wood. It's such a strange picture to use. Why would they use that?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:25.645 --> 0:59:28.227]: 
  Why are they used to it? He told me it was why you were there.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:28.109 --> 0:59:32.226]: 
  Why don't they, why didn't they have school? Listen, I was trying to figure out what was wrong with you, but the point is... Why would they do that?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:31.804 --> 0:59:41.355]: 
  Why don't they have like a school photo of him sitting there like, just telling me? Yes, it's not like a guy, it's like a guy, it's the worst situation that guy could be in. You know what I mean? Because like, ehhhhh...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:35.584 --> 0:59:36.074]: 
  It's-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:41.355 --> 0:59:57.184]: 
  The cognitive abilities aren't I'm gonna tread lightly here. You know what I mean? But I just don't think you should why why it's to be like if they had them like using a shotgun or like using a writing ball or something It's just bizarre. Yeah, it's something they can't do labor like that. It's just such a strange thing

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:56.492 --> 1:00:00.120]: 
  No, it's like the idea of seeing them. He had a hammer or something.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:57.927 --> 1:00:02.449]: 
  I expect to see like a hammer stop the end. Hit me with all the eye making a bleed stuff.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:02.584 --> 1:00:07.950]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:07.950 --> 1:00:12.507]: 
  I think it's a bad question myself.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:08.963 --> 1:00:31.542]: 
  Why should they be massacred? It's a very strange question, honestly. Who said that? I don't have this syndrome. Cory of the future. Let me ask you this. Cory of the future? Here's a controversial thing. What do you think a parent who they know their kid's going to have Down syndrome and they decide to have the kid anyway? You know what I mean? How is such a fine line?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:14.228 --> 1:00:15.038]: 
  On s'est dit...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:17.721 --> 1:00:17.991]: 
  Let me in.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:17.991 --> 1:00:18.025]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:20.337 --> 1:00:20.354]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:27.509 --> 1:00:28.184]: 
  You know what I think?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:29.500 --> 1:00:30.242]: 
  HELLO...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:31.474 --> 1:00:34.360]: 
  How early do they figure out? How many weeks is it?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:33.769 --> 1:00:50.020]: 
  Let's say they could abort him. But how early is though? How many weeks in? I don't know, does it matter? Yeah, cause that's a whole abortion debate. Cause it's how like, how developed the baby is. I'm saying they know before... There's like a gray area when it's full of gray. Let's say like two or three months in, they know... Well, it's not.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:40.300 --> 1:00:42.561]: 
  Yeah, cause that's a whole abortion debate with sleep.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:47.640]: 
  Let's say like, let's say

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:49.412 --> 1:00:51.994]: 
  Well it's not. I think 3 months is pretty far in though.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:51.994 --> 1:01:15.788]: 
  Most people right let's do two months one month Let's say the woman's pregnant the fetus can and they know very actually know like within a day He's gonna be to have Down syndrome today within day one they can winster eyes Within day two that's a job The day one they can winster eyes we be by that day two they can winster eyes.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:54.390 --> 1:00:55.099]: 
  Whoa.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:59.031 --> 1:01:01.799]: 
  Today he's gonna have Down syndrome.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:04.954 --> 1:01:06.844]: 
  within day two they can say JOOOOOO

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:07.587 --> 1:01:08.616]: 
  with these devils

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:14.421 --> 1:01:15.130]: 
  Feels. Feels.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:15.788 --> 1:01:16.379]: 
  Listen.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:17.189 --> 1:01:24.276]: 
  Let's say you're having a kid. You're having a kid, you know, he's never gonna be able to hold a job. He's gonna have health problems.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:22.049 --> 1:01:22.774]: 
  How do you know that?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:23.972 --> 1:01:27.685]: 
  Let's say he's on the low, the low cognitive end of that. Let's say, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:26.554 --> 1:01:43.598]: 
  Let's say and he's gonna always need medical bill He's on a very high medical bills and he still might die early because of all his problems Well, I guess it's it's one of those gray areas because it's like that you could be dealing with a family Who's like they want someone actually wanted to be a panther whole life and they don't really care for the idea of the

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:42.889 --> 1:01:45.606]: 
  Yeah, but you'll be literally a perich your whole life.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:44.762 --> 1:02:09.771]: 
  Yeah, but also there's like yeah, but if they're dying it's varying degrees of how bad that can be I said, oh, I said, let's say the let's say the supposed baby has a little is on a low cognitive end Like the worst kind Knowing your child is gonna suffer his whole life just so you can basically have like a glorified cat But I think like I think I honestly if it's just if it's gonna come out as a vegetable then you know

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:55.545 --> 1:01:55.900]: 
  first time.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:55.900 --> 1:01:57.587]:

  I don't think so.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:09.417 --> 1:02:12.859]: 
  The other bitch probably just was like, It can't speak at all. It can't speak.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:11.037 --> 1:02:14.749]:

  Holy fuck, that's too far to be called.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:18.951 --> 1:02:24.165]: 
  It's just pure like negativity emitting from it at all times. And you might as well just like, it's like, if you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:23.136 --> 1:02:28.992]: 
  Especially like if you know you're gonna have a kid

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:52.296 --> 1:02:56.245]: 
  You can afford it, you can just take a sharp pencil.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:55.739 --> 1:03:03.619]: 
  Oh, oh, it would be... Oh, I'd get rid of it. I think there's a gray area. If your kid's going to have some sort of disability...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:03.619 --> 1:03:07.652]: 
  That completely it pairs it for a life, makes it miserable to total life.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:07.652 --> 1:03:14.993]: 
  There's a certain point where it's like there's a disability and then there's like a liability. That's so cute.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:13.491 --> 1:03:13.997]: 
  That's so beautiful.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:17.069 --> 1:03:37.943]: 
  Cory! Cory! It's true, it's true, it actually is true. Like if you just had a kid who had a gimp arm and half his brain didn't work, that's fine. But if you had a kid who's a fucking vegetable and he's going to die before he's like, oh! Let me pretend to be your kid.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:31.379 --> 1:03:33.049]: 
  He's gonna die before he's like, oh!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:37.943 --> 1:03:45.992]: 
  Edeve replica

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:40.322 --> 1:03:40.930]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:07.744 --> 1:04:08.639]: 
  You know the big guy.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:17.582 --> 1:04:20.940]: 
  I don't just hope Pegman's raised him and I don't have to deal with him anymore.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:20.282 --> 1:04:27.505]: 
  He's just like, oh! Oh my god. He goes back to the green.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:27.505 --> 1:04:39.942]: 
  He's like, clack, clack, clack. He's like clack like a penguin. He's like pissed off at me. And then you're like, penguins still look quack. It's so stupid. Nothing's changed. You still have a large shit.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:41.106 --> 1:06:14.003]: 
  That's fucking dope. You gotta do your taxes? No! Can we just clarify that the kind of people we're talking about are people who can't even like... That's what I'm saying! I'm just like, yeah, I'm not saying... I'm saying if you can think... They don't even know their name, they don't... Yeah, if they have a disability, that's one thing, but if they're fucking gone, like they're gone. I mean, parents... That's a gray area. I am not someone... I am not someone's lives in the wrong ones. I am speaking on behalf of someone who cannot be in someone's shoes, who has to deal with someone who is on the board. By the way, there are plenty of people with disabilities that are completely like high or medium cognitive abilities, but they're fine. Yeah, I don't want to sound... Yeah, I don't want to sound cruel. I'm just saying that these parents have kids where... We're not. Like, they're missing their... the skin, like they can't... Yeah. They're completely blind, they can't see, they're missing their tongue, they're... That's sad. They're like, they're crippled. I wouldn't want that. And they decide to take care of this thing, it's whole painful life. Yeah, but like I said, I think this also is true, is you think of them, and that's good. Like, you're not being selfish, because that's a really good part of being... It is kind of... It is a little bit... They say they're not, but they are, because they so badly want to take care of something almost. Yeah. They let this thing suffer for years. But it's like, I completely agree with you. I wouldn't want a kid who's like a walking volcano, I would want to like take care of him. Volcano. I would want to take care of him if he was still... if he had Down syndrome, that's... you know, that's fine. But if he was like... We're talking so far gone. If he was like a fucking bomb ready to go off, I don't want to deal with that, because A, I'm the fucking... Or... magazine is gonna be knocking on my door and be like, hey, can you help me out? That's not just...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:41.258 --> 1:04:41.950]: 
  That's fucking...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:49.392 --> 1:04:52.041]: 
  That's what I'm saying!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:54.488 --> 1:04:54.505]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:00.664 --> 1:05:05.136]: 
  I mean, that's a gray area. If they're just like ruining the parents' lives in the wrong ones.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:09.389 --> 1:05:10.823]: 
  By the way, by the way, by the way, by the way...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:13.877 --> 1:05:15.734]: 
  Yeah, I know, I know myself.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:25.487 --> 1:05:27.276]: 
  That's sad. I wouldn't have whippled that.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:31.056 --> 1:05:31.630]: 
  Yeah, but like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:39.105 --> 1:05:42.750]: 
  It is kind of

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:46.395 --> 1:05:49.163]: 
  Yeah, maybe they're all for years

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:46.935 --> 1:05:47.003]: 
  MBC 뉴스 이덕영입니다.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:03.524 --> 1:06:04.958]: 
  He was like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:14.003 --> 1:06:19.994]: 
  say that's such as the people who do end up living, it doesn't mean they don't deserve to live, it's just like if you could prevent

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:19.994 --> 1:06:22.947]: 
  Sweet for being in pain their whole lives why what's

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:22.947 --> 1:06:23.993]: 
  the moral reason why you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:23.993 --> 1:07:10.905]: 
  wouldn't do that. I mean, I completely agree. I just say there's a gray area and I say, you, I've said that before, but there was also like that chick who, her daughter had like a disability and she died and she like, mommy encased her. What? She was in like this thing, she was dead and then she was basically profiting off her death and this girl, she had like some disability that was like rare and she was charging people money to see her and give her wishes and that's fucked up. Like the dead daughter would grant somebody a wish, you mean? He's going to Irish story territory here. Have you ever seen that like, late, or have you seen that girl who had like a little girl and the baby like died like pretty much straight away, but she had it mummified and she carried around with her like a doll?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:24.634 --> 1:06:26.997]: 
  I mean, real cave.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:53.001 --> 1:06:55.566]: 
  What the dead dog would grace to be a wishy-bee?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:57.945 --> 1:06:58.958]: 
  Don't我很

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:00.527 --> 1:07:01.304]: 
  Have you ever seen this?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:10.905 --> 1:07:14.635]: 
  You see, that's the kind of people... He put in a slow white dress too. That's the kind of people...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:11.496 --> 1:07:12.947]: 
  It's still white dress too.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:14.635 --> 1:07:23.224]: 
  No, okay, I'm asking. That is absolutely true. That's the kind of people. Like, that's horrible to laugh at, boy. That's the kind of people who you said I didn't know. See it in a snow white dress is horrible.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:15.495 --> 1:07:15.765]: 
  Don't play.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:17.824 --> 1:07:19.275]: 
  That's the kind of people.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:20.440 --> 1:07:31.088]: 
  That's the kind of people who you said that to an idea like you're a horrible person. Fucking just- They found a snow white doll dress and put the dead mother of five fetus in a snow white dress. I'm sorry, but it looks funny.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:28.624 --> 1:09]: 
  No, I'm sorry, but it looks funny. That's messed up. So let's just say if you knew a kid was just going to have mild autism. Me? Let's see if there's going to be a typical down to them, like that guy, Corey, from Life Goes On. You remember that show? Never mind. His name is Corey? His name was Corey. You look sad. I said that not even realizing his name. Like Corey. You know, Corey, he's fucking dead. She left us on. You left him even if he was disappointed. Like, you're like, what? What do you mean? It's like, I hurt your feelings. I didn't mean it like that. No, it's fine. It's fine. I don't know. I don't know. There was a guy named Corey on a show called Life Goes On. Was it played by? I think it was Corey. He was a guy. Was it played by Johnny DeCaprio or whatever his name is? No, no. What? DeCaprio? Leonardo Giudino. No, no, no, no. That was the teen in Gilbert Grape. He was retarded in that movie. Now, this is a legitimate Down syndrome person. I wanted. I don't want that. If there was a point where I would like to think that me and my wife were on the same sort of idea with having a kid with Down syndrome. What if? What if the doc? All right, theoretically, what if the doctor came to you and he looked at the ultrasound, he said, listen, sir, I don't want to give you bad news, but this child that is coming, the doctor's not going to tell you he is Down syndrome. He's basically going to say, listen, this kid, basically his whole life he's going to be on the computer typing out hot memes all day. He's going to be sharing the hottest memes all day. And that's all he's going to do his whole life. So this is this just for just for like clarification, this is the future where they've already like completely mapped out your future life. And he's like, he's going to be a means viewer on four. Let's say, let's say.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:45.820 --> 1:07:46.039]: 
  you

  All the section is going to be to awkward peg with a drill face. It's a better client.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:34.595 --> 1:09:55.538]: 
  I would be like, I would be like, when he's not looking. You kill your son? He told you to snap it in the wound, like twist his head while he's in the wound. I would say, I would say, have you played Hitman? I would say being conspicuous, okay? I'm paying you good money. You're just gonna whisper him like listen, just...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:44.822 --> 1:09:48.349]: 
  in the

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:48.990 --> 1:09:50.761]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:53.091 --> 1:09:53.546]: 
  be.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:56.736 --> 1:10:03.992]: 
  while you're, you know. Just a little. Yeah, and then just don't tell, just tell. When he comes out dead, just act surprised.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:56.804 --> 1:09:58.002]: 
  Just a little...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:58.002 --> 1:10:00.297]: 
  Yeah, and then just don't tell it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:03.992 --> 1:10:14.455]: 
  What if you said that and the doctor looked at you? Hahahaha There's a big old face when the dead baby comes out. The fucking dead baby rolls out.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:11.485 --> 1:10:15.450]: 
  That's when the dead baby comes out. The fucking dead baby rolls out. Oh no!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:15.450 --> 1:10:25.575]: 
  What is that? I didn't have to do that, that's weird. I can't believe it's dead. That never happened. Oh my god, it's head came off. That never happened. I don't know what the fuck.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:25.002 --> 1:10:29.001]: 
  What was that crack? I just stepped on a peanut.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:27.837 --> 1:10:42.872]: 
  I was cracking my knuckles in here. I know it's bad for arthritis, but you know whatever. So those are the things that get exhausted. What happens is you creep up the knees and then pop his head up like a doll. That's what happens, ladies. It's your fault. You killed the child. Okay, I understand.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:39.413 --> 1:10:40.797]: 
  So have a lady's earful.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:41.809 --> 1:10:46.011]: 
  Okay, I'll snap this. The worms in my heart were back to the dead baby.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:45.724 --> 1:10:51.867]: 
  Jeff, what would you do, Jeff, if you were... But this is constant. If you were with your beautiful wife.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:46.720 --> 1:11:07.442]: 
  What'd you do, Jeff? If you were... But this is constant! This guy... If you were with your beautiful wife... This guy, this kid is a mean-smewing idiot from the future. He's the worst kind of kid. Jeff, if you were with your beautiful wife... And the doctor, you'd hear the emergency room. And your wife... She creaks and she giggles. You're like, that's gross.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:57.419 --> 1:10:58.448]: 
  Диапидия!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:03.494 --> 1:11:03.612]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:07.257 --> 1:11:22.849]: 
  But then you see a little baby head come out. And the doctor pulls her side and says, Jeff, your wife just queefed up the baby's ass. And it killed your baby. Popped the baby's head off. Your wife just killed your baby. And your wife says, she's still giggling and laughing. What do you do? Are you angry at your wife?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:23.102 --> 1:12:22.182]: 
  I'd probably be more mad she's probably laughing at a terrible joke than having a dead baby I'd shrug at the dead kid. You jerk your son's head, rolls to the floor and looks up and says Dah dah, dah dah What do you do? How the fuck is his head still? I would Because baby's head lives for two more years after it dies Alright Chris I would kinda slide him into a dark corner with my foot Let's say your kid comes out and he's the polar opposite of everything you enjoy He hates everything you enjoy You're like, man, I love Final Fantasy 7 He's like, that was the worst RPG ever made Old man I grab him by his turkey neck and hold him against the wall Why is he a turkey neck? His turkey neck is cracked on his thigh Chris, what if you slip him out? There you go, if you're bored and you're a little shit, you're getting it You're getting a wallop when you pop out of the pussy Daddy wallop What if your little kid's like, I wanna play physics games on YouTube all day What if he's like Would you beat him to death? What if he walked and he said

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:28.283 --> 1:11:32.468]: 
  I'd shrug at the dead kid.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:43.994 --> 1:11:46.761]: 
  foot hoping nobody saw a notice before it died.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:57.764 --> 1:12:01.493]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:32.549 --> 1:15:36.008]: 
  I'm looking forward to that. I'm gonna watch Bittical. So when they've produced it,

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:36.008 --> 1:15:43.770]: 
  That was did everybody like the people sort of is gonna be a lighter show. I'll tell you what I'm just I just want The walking dead to go away. Yeah, be replaced by something

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:42.032 --> 1:15:52.799]: 
  Yeah, you can be replaced by something in a row. I've been watching The Walking Dead for pretty much the start. And it's just, it's one of those shows that I don't like. I would never recommend it to anybody, but I still watch it. It's just fascinating. Like, it's not, it's not...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:52.799 --> 1:17:06.323]: 
  There have been some really bad episodes where I've laughed at the serious parts, but there have been some okay parts like that. That was done kind of well. It's bizarre. It's so weird. I guess my biggest issue with Walking Dead is I read the comic first, so I'm not trying to pull a hipster card, but I read the comic and I thoroughly enjoyed the comic over the actual TV show. And when I saw the first episode, it was pretty much incredibly faithful to the comic, so I like the first episode a lot. The first season was somewhat lenient in the comic, but then it pretty much just like, it kind of follows the main motifs, like the stuff where they like go to the jail and set up shop for like a while and shit, and like just like over time you like learn the people in jail and how they react, and it's like they did that, but the characters in the comic were way fucking better, and the comic was way darker, and it was good. Because like before they went to jail, there was a lot of shit that built up from that, and there was a lot of like bridges that were burnt, and it was just the comic is really fucking good. And I watched the show and I'm like, man, this is Dullsbury. He's fucking, I don't even care. Yeah, he's a horrible... Regardless of even what people think of it being good or bad, I just find it depressing as shit. Yeah. I don't like watching depressing, I mean, it's my weakness. I don't really, I don't look forward to watching depressing. But it was a good save.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:00.375 --> 1:16:00.882]: 
  It's Hello 하실 것 같 why inform

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:14.972 --> 1:16:15.445]: 
  So I like this.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:15.445 --> 1:16:16.508]: 
  Please step aside a little bit.

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:59.303 --> 1:16:59.708]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:03.049 --> 1:17:07.994]: 
  I don't look forward to watching depressing.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:07.994 --> 1:17:30.505]: 
  Had a place to go though. They would walk again is like always people were just in the proper That has a lot of humor dark fun dialogue breaking Walking dead is just people breaking down and crying It's like a lot I feel like nine-tenths of the audience tunes in just so they can see dead people get stabbed in the head with screwdriver But yeah, it's just I'm just What I think what I think makes a lot of fun

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:11.925 --> 1:17:12.854]: 
  Bring bed has a lot of...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:25.847 --> 1:17:28.514]: 
  Yeah, it's just I'm just like oh my god

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:29.999 --> 1:17:36.344]: 
  a lot of zombie movies work it's like at the end they always have some sort of vaguely hopeful messages like oh

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:36.040 --> 1:17:40.950]: 
  like oh at least we can rebuild at least we can survive but the TV series they can't really make the world

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:40.950 --> 1:17:45.405]: 
  go better so it's constantly just like oh this person got sabotaged.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:44.444 --> 1:18:56.702]: 
  That's why I really liked the remake of dawn of the dead because of all the characters like the first character That you meet at the beginning He's like an asshole then he like turns around and he's like one of the most likable guys Yeah, it's like it's really interesting how like the characters come together in an apocalypse and how they change that guy was an asshole The whole movie. Yeah, but he was likable and then like he was There was like a He I liked him I He was funny and then he like even at the end of the movie though Like are you gonna help he's like fuck you no not that asshole not the rich one Oh, which one the one that pulled the gum on gun on them and like trick them and then they tricked all the security Fucking rich guy was a faggot. He's like I'm rich How about you make me a water Motherfucker god dammit I like that All right, all right Everyone else is good and I know there's people wincing and listening right now not not not to bomb with you But I know there's people like oh well that wasn't as good as their original the original dawn of the dead fucking the original Don and dad you know what that part where they like in the beginning where they like the guy bites into her and it's cute But then like like biting into styrofoam with red dye and he's like oh

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:49.472 --> 1:17:50.114]: 
  Like the first

 SPEAKER_00 [1:17:55.109 --> 1:17:55.497]:

  Like everyone else is good and

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:57.377 --> 1:19:02.372]: 
  The reboot of the walking dead TV series is it it started off with some brilliant

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:02.372 --> 1:19:12.700]: 
  good effects in the first season. Oh the Walking Dead has a TV series. Dude I will give him credit where credit is due. The Walking Dead zombies look like scary. But I gotta say

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:12.700 --> 1:19:45.387]: 
  But so season one had pretty good effects then season two to my knowledge what I've heard from like Frank Derrenbauer Derrenbauer whatever his name is You know apparently they they they doubled the episode amount from season one and cut the budget in half from season one So this is up and season three and four didn't have really good effects but season five Has better effects closer to season one, but so but they've had some really good effects. They've had some really interesting Uh, uh traditional like makeup stuff done that looks really good, frankly But then they have all this fucking CG blood that looks like a face of a

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:21.154 --> 1:19:21.509]: 
  See you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:44.273 --> 1:20:33.734]: 
  Yeah, that's something that I don't and like another thing that I guess I that came from the Walking Dead was the Telltale series like I know people say it's like it's really good like visual novel and it's like a couple days ago It's really good, and it's really like You start out and you're like oh man It's this game we good and you really start to enjoy all the characters and then there's some you like there's some you hate And the main guy is so likable after a while. You know what pisses me off though in that game I don't know I don't know how games are still doing this, but when the camera like changes position in that game It like freezes for like five like like you said it's just freezes like 15 frames. It's like why are you this is? 2014 how it's loading like it's like a layer the graphics are shit in that game But that's a good good. The graph is I like it's solid, but it shouldn't fucking take 15 frames for the camera

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:56.119 --> 1:19:57.334]: 
  Chris just played a couple days ago.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:08.775 --> 1:20:10.193]: 
  After one that game? What's that?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:17.432 --> 1:20:19.424]: 
  Oh yeah, that's what you said, uh- It just freezes like-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:24.756 --> 1:20:25.836]: 
  I think it's loading.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:33.548 --> 1:20:38.189]: 
  I think we're saying is the graphics aren't that good so it should make up with cameras.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:37.260 --> 1:21:06.387]: 
  Yeah, I know, I do agree and I know you're talking about it. Like when you walk into a fucking room and your character's standing there and then it comes in and there's like enemies. You're like, what the fuck? Dude, just look at how... I don't know. Did you guys play the Telltale back to the future games? No. I didn't like them. I heard they were like just boring and silly. Really strange. You spend like, you spend like three-fifth the game at like a soup kitchen or something in 1930. It's... What the fuck? What? It's strange. I thought it started off really, really interesting. You spend...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:39.522 --> 1:20:40.652]: 
  Are you moaning?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:44.804 --> 1:20:45.259]:

  Really?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:21:02.894 --> 1:21:03.957]: 
  I thought it started with a

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:04.092 --> 1:21:09.981]: 
  Really walk interesting you spend Christopher Lloyd actually voiced off

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:07.551 --> 1:21:09.458]: 
  Yeah, no, it's like dying in there

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:10.740 --> 1:21:20.663]: 
  It's really funny to me if you watch the original back to future like it's if you watch like an hd screen You could tell his makeup is like really visible

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:20.190 --> 1:21:22.637]: 
  He's only four years after one flu over the cookies mess.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:22.232 --> 1:21:30.062]: 
  He's only 40 years old that but now he looks like actually dog brother did it in that movie Yeah, yeah But he sounds way he's like It's like god damn it What are you saying?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:25.692 --> 1:21:26.502]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:29.489 --> 1:21:56.134]: 
  What do you see in that show with Pamela Anderson? This show. I forget what it was called but it's stunk. Capporo. Black Brown. Chris Filoen. Pamela Pornow. The other TV series I saw that I liked was Rick and Morty. That's a pretty good show. I like that. I like Rick and Morty. It's a good show. It's interesting. It's a tween show. I think I was a fan of tweens but they do it well because the art's good and the poses are really dynamic. Yeah, exactly. Really? Exactly. Well they have solid in between.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:31.834 --> 1:21:32.357]: 
  the show.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:21:35.074 --> 1:21:35.462]: 
  squareived...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:21:43.056 --> 1:21:43.934]: 
  I like Rick and Morty.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:51.915 --> 1:21:52.709]: 
  It's tweeted.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:53.502 --> 1:21:54.767]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:55.780 --> 1:21:59.442]: 
  That's what I mean, like they do it well. It doesn't feel like it's not like a,

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:59.442 --> 1:22:19.034]: 
  The total drama island kind of tweeting words just I'm gonna get shot by that But my point is it's not like do total Tom islands animation is garbage people people still fucking joke up that you know Yeah, well who cares it's like stiff and ugly Never seen the same as a celluloid feet that make no goddamn sense Rick and Morty. I hate the everybody's eye pupils

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:06.360 --> 1:22:06.698]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:07.947 --> 1:22:09.297]: 
  I still fucking joke up that you know

 SPEAKER_03 [1:22:12.098 --> 1:22:13.094]: 
  M sword

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:19.270 --> 1:22:22.797]: 
  I did like that a person is so unique, it's never done before.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:21.565 --> 1:22:24.214]: 
  Scrambled eggs, I can't stand it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:24.214 --> 1:22:27.724]: 
  You can really notice it until they zoom up really close to their faces. I'll be honest.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:26.796 --> 1:22:47.704]: 
  I'll be honest. And the character designs are, they're likable but bad at the same time. It's like another TV show where the character designs are, it's like they're drawn, it's like the style is a draw, it's like the art of like a 15 year old in high school. I just don't, it's really strange to me. It's like every popular animated TV show with like a family, it's drawn like a 15 year old

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:47.670 --> 1:22:55.214]: 
  But it's not done in a way where it's like, oh, this is bad. Like, they do it well. It's simple, but it's still appealing. Yeah. It doesn't make you go, ugh.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:52.193 --> 1:22:53.948]: 
  It's still appealing. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:54.994 --> 1:23:08.950]: 
  If you've seen Doc and Marty the original one South at Burger Show I prefer those characters as well Bob's Burgers Can you see Doc and Marty? It's what it's based on You like Bob's Burgers? No Man I hate Bob's fucking burgers I've never seen it, I just hate the art style I don't even know what it's called

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:57.239 --> 1:23:00.951]: 
  I prefer those characters size way more Bob's burger

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:01.947 --> 1:23:04.039]: 
  It's what it's based on

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:05.997 --> 1:23:10.452]: 
  I've never seen it, I just hate the art style. I don't even know what it's called.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:10.334 --> 1:23:13.034]: 
  Chris hates Bob burgers. I'm not gonna come right

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:12.224 --> 1:23:21.572]: 
  I can't stand his fucking face. If you've actually watched, it's not a show. I guess for me, it's kind of hard for me to not... What's his name? John Benjamin. I like John Benjamin. He was kind of...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:14.940 --> 1:23:17.100]: 
  It's not a show.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:21.572 --> 1:23:32.946]: 
  Yeah, he was good at himself. He talks. How talented of him. He's funny. What do you have to say to yourself? Are you John Benjamin? Fuck you. Were you in horror movies?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:25.589 --> 1:23:26.500]: 
  Kom, kom.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:26.500 --> 1:23:27.597]: 
  He's not guaranteed up him.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:27.209 --> 1:23:27.445]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:32.946 --> 1:24:38.640]: 
  Fuck you. I always thought Home Movies was a good show because of like... I love Home Movies, dude. Here's fucking like Brian, like is that like... What's the kid's name? Yeah, Brian. Brendan. Brendan. This fucking like eight year old kid who doesn't play soccer and his coach just talked to him and he's like, don't waste all your money on beer, Brendan. It's stupid. Go play soccer. And he's like, don't play soccer. They suck. Okay, why are you... I love Home Movies. It's funny because it's like... I love his coach with dirt. Yeah, he shares his life experience with his eight year old and his eight year old is like so adult for his age. He's like, yeah, I agree. I'm making him movie. When everyone started picking up that he had a cool voice then yeah, he started getting overusing it. Oh yeah, man. I will admit that it's weird hearing... Like I still can't really... I haven't seen Anchor, but like... Archer. Archer. Yeah, it's weird hearing his voice as like... You would think it'd be Suave, but I guess that's kind of pretty cool. I can't stand the fact that he doesn't even try and change his voice for any of his roles. It's just insubstantial. I guess because like when they tell him to like, hey, like Michael Surra, like Michael Surra? Yeah. Like just be the producer, just be like, just do your thing. Just do your job better. He's like, you sure? I can do a...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:37.705 --> 1:23:38.751]:

  Yeah, Brian, Brendan.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:23:55.272 --> 1:23:56.436]: 
  That's a funny show.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:58.157 --> 1:23:59.372]: 
  I love you, Coach McGurk!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:08.738 --> 1:24:09.801]: 
  Oh yeah, I'm fucking...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:09.801 --> 1:24:10.662]: 
  I will admit

No, it's fine. Anyway, Korean... The first one, it's basically kind of think of it in the style of Dredd, where it made it get straight to the point, they're in a place, they're locked down, but it's just filled to the fucking brim with just action and kung fu for like an hour and a half of just non-stop fighting with these crazy fucking... And it is gory, and they do not... They're not holding your hand through it. They're like fucking like... CKK

 SPEAKER_03 [1:25:27.831 --> 1:25:29.924]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:02.256 --> 1:26:31.568]: 
  was good it was filled to the brim with action but the first one was just the second one felt like a fucking anime like it felt towards the end it felt like I was like watching something they'd be on to Nami in 2009 but the first one felt like it was grounded in reality at some point like some white like old action grindhust shit snort peps asks does Linda still hate you guys Linda never fucking what is what is this shenanigans of Linda she first records in a sort of me

He's like insinuating the guy is out there like fucking hookers. He's like, you know, he's doing out, you know, he's doing out here at 3 AM in the morning. He's like, what? Yes, he's exactly like that. Dude, you spoke at Pillsley back to watch the Instagram channel for four hours and go to the... He had white hair, wrinkles. He couldn't even walk straight. Did he have the prerequisite for that? He's just an old man looking for a... he just wanted a sandwich. So he could watch, like, all in the family at four in the morning on TV time. Before he died, like a horrible death. Before he killed himself. And then I went back another night and he's like, and there was just some teenage girls, like, I'm not gonna find yogurt or something.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:30:19.127 --> 1:30:46.094]: 
  It's exhausting dealing with him. So that answers the question about Liddof. All right, I don't have any bad blood with Lina. Let me tell you something. Next question, man. She won't say it. What? When you leave, whoa, whoa. Well, when you pay for your big fat hoagie or whatever, when you give her the cash, and the little change comes out next to the donation box. Yeah, I don't pay with cash. I just pay with my car. OK, well, you're missing out, because if you put the money in the donation box, Linda slips you a little glance at her titty. Yes, she.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:30:20.258 --> 1:30:21.270]: 
  So that answers the question.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:30:21.270 --> 1:30:22.165]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:30:26.350 --> 1:30:26.654]: 
  Cheers.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:30:46.988 --> 1:30:50.312]: 
  Did she like say that? Did she lift up her skirt because it's like sitting on the floor?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:30:50.279 --> 1:30:53.502]: 
  Yeah, she holds up two slaves under the couch and she's like, have a...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:30:53.502 --> 1:31:13.752]: 
  I'm afraid to touch her because she looks like she has that old person tissue paper skin. What if you tease a little bit? What if you roll a quarter up and down on the donation? She's like doing this. Her titties are like up and down.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:37:19.264 --> 1:37:48.947]: 
  Can I just say, this is a common incorrect belief. People say, oh, the golden age of online animation is dead. You guys, if you really think there was a golden age of online animation, you were too young to be, you were too young or not even born to- I mean, the animations sucked. The animations sucked. There were more pairings, not less. The humor was worse. If anything, all this happened since 2005 to 2008. People think, how back in 2009, it was so good. Back in 2010, no. You could watch.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:37:35.363 --> 1:37:37.152]: 
  I mean the animations sucked.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:37:48.947 --> 1:37:57.503]: 
  You could watch Sonic vs Mario and then next you could watch Zelda goes to the drugstore.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:37:56.069 --> 1:38:02.819]: 
  And I was there was there was a knock on the question of just saying this is no no I see this so I see this so often the only difference is Adam

  Can I tell you a story about Anvil?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:46.812]: 
  You call them a dirty Aussie fag boy. I did, but that's not what I'm talking about. I don't even know him. So I didn't say that. But I like to meet him because I'm curious because like everyone's like, oh Adam Phillips is amazing. He's so cool. He is, he's so cool. But I don't know who the fuck he is and then I see him and I'm like, who is this cat?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:38:41.985 --> 1:38:43.335]: 
  Yes. He's so cool. What is that?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:38:45.495 --> 1:38:45.546]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:38:46.407 --> 1:38:49.410]: 
  Look up at it, Phillips, on Google, you'll see some of his work, he's really talented.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:38:49.410 --> 1:39:48.743]: 
  Tom and I, Tom and myself and Stamper were making a game in 2006 based on um... Oh yeah, I know what you're gonna say. Oh, do you know what his name is? I forget his name now. I feel bad. Kevin... Before I say something... He's Britney Spears' boyfriend, right? I just, I want to talk. Kevin Federline. Tom Federline. Kevin Federline, yeah. Tom and myself and Stamper were making a game based on Kevin Federline where you beat up Britney Spears. It's really weird. You can juggle to her baby and stuff with her punches, but... Wow. We did all the art in the... We did everything with the game and then we said... At the time, Adam Phillips was like huge. Like he had like the best animation on the fucking internet. And we said, we'd like them to be part of this game. So we're like, what can we have them do? Because like the whole game was almost done and we didn't want to take up all his time. So we said, you know... You can have blood effects. Well, that was close. We, at the end of the game, Adam Phillips starts piss, you can piss on like Britney. And we said, what if we got Adam to animate the piss? That's like a little bit... A basically animated one piss droplet.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:38:58.945 --> 1:39:00.953]: 
  Okay, I've been... Before I say something, you're really sp-

  Kiss.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:39:49.924 --> 1:40:01.872]: 
  Back to us. Tom coated it so the piss would go all over the fucking screen, but he animated it. It's like the credits are like Stanford, Johnny Yutah, Tom Fulp, and it's like, and special thanks to Adam Phillips for the piss drop.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:40:04.049 --> 1:40:16.452]: 
  But I just wanted to dispel the rumor that I hear Honestly? Younger guys who were like 13 and to 15 to maybe 17 who say there was a golden age and now all now it's all dead It no you're too young

 SPEAKER_03 [1:40:04.302 --> 1:40:04.572]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:40:16.452 --> 1:40:33.512]: 
  to remember it was it was worse back there always be good humor there will always be best there's a lot of obnoxious shitty corny humor today but it was changed with age like stuff different things that you didn't find funny before become funnier the older you get

 SPEAKER_03 [1:40:18.561 --> 1:40:19.152]: 
  There were always...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:40:20.535 --> 1:40:20.890]: 
  We miss.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:40:24.788 --> 1:40:27.842]: 
  It was changed. I would see all the difference between...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:40:33.512 --> 1:40:53.982]: 
  And I would even say go back and watch the stuff that you think is golden, go back and watch it. It's not that good like the people who... I mean it's still good for what it was, but if you go back and watch the stuff now that you think is the golden age, it's honestly... It's whatever. The only difference between now and then, there's exactly about the parents, I would say more parents today. The only difference is today that people are better at animating.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:40:53.982 --> 1:41:24.424]: 
  Do you know what I feel like more or less this falls in too? I feel like a lot of people let nostalgia clog their vision. That's all it is. That's all it is. It's just a soldier I was they remember the good times way better. Yeah, they remember the good times Well, that's another thing too like you see these animators you see animations So like and then you see fucking animators now and they're like like cuz the bar is like set They're like I gotta be like these motherfuckers.

  Napster has those ads on TV where it's like send a text message to blah blah blah and we'll send you these wallpapers and ringtones Basically, yeah, they changed into that. Basically, just to get off topic. There was Napster There was a big controversy Metallica was pissed off because their music was being shared on Napster So a guy who actually became like my boss for a while He animated the series called Napster Bad where James Hadfield and Lars Ulrich were cartoon characters And James Hadfield would be like Napster Bad and he like swings arm across the screen But they were popular on the internet for a while Yeah, they were like the first some of the first flash cartoons because it was controversial because it was like it was topical They're actually not he animated, you know, it was very crude the animation was crude But it was very lively and they were very popular at the time. That's cool and like 2001 or something And see that's a this kind of falls into like the the question it's not on the paper But it's kind of like the same vein. It's like the so I'm gonna be treading on water and this is the only time I will ever talk about this but the topic of Chris Chan Okay, because Chris Chan as gay as it is to say was a big part of my life back in 2007 because I made the animated series and that's how I mean you guys Yeah, and I didn't even fucking know anyone I just wanted to I thought this guy was fucking hilarious and I thought he was a joke like a troll and then I found out later He wasn't and it like I was fascinated It sparked my curiosity for that kind of stuff. He's definitely like the only weird autistic person. I would call almost brilliant Exactly he made like a series He based his entire life and he created like crayon copyrights Like fucking like crayola crayons like a five-year-old would draw and there are 12 year olds who have better art styles and art Talent than him and he fucking like made a series with pokemon and sonic sorry, but one of the most autistic franchises out there and he put them together And he and he made sonichu and I'm just like, oh my god. This is amazing and I I suckered in and I was into the whole trolling thing and for four years of my fucking life. I used ms paint animated Crudely like renon stampy style drawings overly grotesque Fucking chris chan stuff that I eventually made like a big part of my life because that's how I started getting like attention And shit and then it just became sadder the more chris chan went on Like he became a tranny and then his dad died and then everyone's like you should you should make fun of chris chan It's like dude his fucking family's dead his house house bro. Dell he's trying to make money on ebay and people are still Trolling him and fucking with him. I know he's a despicable person because he was like racist and Stupid and ignorant and horrible his life adventures were amazing. Yes. They were he he was just like it was incredible it If chris bores had a had a build up like that. I'm sure chris bores would be the legacy He could have been it's looking chris chan's life is like looking at walter white's life. He starts off like somebody completely I don't even know what's wrong with it, but I know that he like completely changed because he starts off being like No homeless. I ain't no gay and then he could be he's like putting his hair up. He's like this is how you apply lipstick

 SPEAKER_00 [1:42:36.109 --> 1:42:37.004]: 
  basically just to get out

 SPEAKER_02 [1:42:37.004 --> 1:42:38.016]: 
  And first though...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:42:43.500 --> 1:42:44.445]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:45:50.982 --> 1:48:41.234]: 
  There's like chronologically ordered. There's like there's an archive because let me tell you something if you if you thought Christian Was like autistic there are people who have archived him eating breathing and shitting and it's on his There's video of him as a little kid winning some contest. Yeah. Yeah, that's actually like because he won a sonic contest ages ago And that's what sparked his like His ranting on like not liking black girls And there's like some audio of him trying to talk a game stop Yes, there's so much ignorance got kicked out. He's trying to get back into the store. I've never laughed harder Yeah, yeah, like Christian is he's an he's an enigma which to so many people they thought he was a troll Cuz they're like, there's no way this motherfucker is real because it's like he's the most saddest human being ever And it's sad because it's like I Spent four years of my life fucking with him and like people are like bring it back. I'm like, no Let it die. It's like it's depressing. Yeah, the golden age I'm depressing and happy Harry Harry Partridge. He's like he loves Christian too. Yeah, and he told me and I think I know this like I know this is well known I don't think he'd care if we shared it, but I think he contacted Chris Chan once. Yeah, I think he said mentioning He mentioned he's like I like to make a game with you And Chris Chan actually turned Harry down like Harry's one of the fuzz fucking animators Christian is like well, you're not you're not you don't have like a Disney style I'm telling you right now That's the thing about Chris Chan. He's super conceited He's super full of himself and it's funny too because like he he makes videos where he's like hey y'all He's like having like a presentation With fucking PowerPoint and like baby tools and like his hasbro like fucking keyboard and he's like present because he's very professionally present stuff and he's like yeah He's a picture a fan made it's like really fucking well done and he's like yeah She she ruined the tail Ruin the picture so I made a new one and then he made it but he's like but I appreciate fan stuff But he will never accept the fact that someone is a better artist than him You always say he's a better artist So he he has to be the lead animator the lead writer the lead director the lead voice actor and you can just be a fan That's what he would do simple these memories him like he ran running around a park with a female like sports brawn Yeah, it's it's fascinating didn't somebody dress him up normal and pretend they said listen just act Okay, we're gonna put some fake tattoos on you and we're gonna put you just sound like just act like this whole time Your entire life has been like That backfire almost it almost was convincing But yeah, but it backfired on him because they're because like this other fucking Chris Chan came in and said like that's just Ian Brandon Anderson because his name on the fucking poster was

 SPEAKER_03 [1:46:04.904 --> 1:46:06.034]:

  I am Chandler and he's like, that, that isn't my, that is a troll name, my name is Chris. Like he, he's so, it's funny cause he's literally convinced people are telling the truth and not fucking with him. Someone would go up to him and be like, Chris Chan, I just sold it, fucking 40 paper medallions online. I'm making millions of dollars and he'd come online and be like, God damn trolls are selling my budget. He gives out his personal information. He's like, this is my phone number, but don't call me. Yes, he literally, he's a retard. He said it himself, so I can say that. And it's sad because like now it's like people link me stuff still because you know, there's those die hard and it's like, man, don't, I don't care. It's depressing. I don't care. It's funny to see that he's still freaking out about Sonic and shit and still like complaining. No, I got my laughs. I got my laughs at it. Yeah, it's like it's over. This one comes from Mr. Dad. If you could work on any cartoon, TV show, pass the present, what would you choose and why?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:49:27.707 --> 1:49:27.994]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:49:39.942 --> 1:49:47.974]: 
  If you could walk into any TV in a cartoon or TV show none of them really you would walk into any TV show If you had the chance to just to be a part of the production now

 SPEAKER_01 [1:49:42.169 --> 1:49:43.587]: 
  TV show.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:49:46.945 --> 1:50:01.120]: 
  No. Really? Work on an ATV show? I just want to make my own stuff. I don't really care. I don't really feel like... I mean, I'd work on Hellbenders. Oh, here we go. I want to work on the Simpsons so I can slip in a horrible joke and then quit.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:49:49.999 --> 1:49:51.045]: 
  I don't really care.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:49:51.045 --> 1:49:51.754]: 
  I don't really want to be a part of this.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:49:54.741 --> 1:49:56.513]: 
  Oh, here we go!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:49:58.757 --> 1:49:59.669]: 
  I was gonna say it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:49:58.994 --> 1:49:59.449]: 
  It's gonna save you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:50:01.120 --> 1:50:08.005]: 
  It would be interesting to work to just be there until you are the writers of the substance just to see how they think it's stuff. Yeah. We'll show like that.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:50:08.005 --> 1:50:10.452]: 
  I like to sit on it. I think you should like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:50:09.777 --> 1:50:11.886]: 
  I think you should like code me these guys we would like to sit on

 SPEAKER_01 [1:50:11.110 --> 1:50:20.459]: 
  I would like to sit on an episode of South Park and see how she goes on. South Park would be full of two. I could totally do like storyboards for South Park if, if, but that's kind of like that's arrogant as fuck. Like, hey! Yep.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:50:13.641 --> 1:50:14.873]: 
  So what could we forward to?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:50:19.969 --> 1:50:24.745]: 
  This is a super you can walk in a show so you can be a writer or an animator or whatever

 SPEAKER_01 [1:50:24.711 --> 1:50:27.394]: 
  I would like to work at South Park for a month.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:50:26.955 --> 1:50:36.017]: 
  It would be interesting to be like one of the writers who sits in there like Bill Hader just to sit there and be like How do they you know, brainstorm stuff? I'd do that. I wouldn't want to animate that. Cause they would say stuff and then you could like try and

 SPEAKER_01 [1:50:28.879 --> 1:50:29.217]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:50:32.170 --> 1:51:03.017]: 
  I do that They would say stuff and then you could like chime in and be like well what if like this happened Yeah, and then you can be as vulgar as you want because they would be fucking like and then her pussy falls off Just a small tangent about South Park. What do you think of these people who've been animating on South Park for years? They're very they're very dedicated like they're there. Do you think they could get a job somewhere else? They could in that style. They could but they like appreciate Matt and Trey and they appreciate how South Park has come up because I'm just thinking

 SPEAKER_02 [1:50:37.435 --> 1:50:38.397]: 
  But this happened, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:50:40.489 --> 1:50:40.759]: 
  Ja.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:50:43.662 --> 1:50:44.067]: 
  Just a...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:50:52.521 --> 1:50:53.449]: 
  Like they're, they're,

 SPEAKER_00 [1:50:55.424 --> 1:50:55.997]: 
  I think that's...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:50:55.997 --> 1:50:56.588]: 
  style

 SPEAKER_02 [1:51:01.347 --> 1:51:04.992]: 
  a lot of the artists if you look at their portfolio

 SPEAKER_01 [1:51:04.992 --> 1:51:18.306]: 
  They're very tell that's actually a down boot for them. If I can say that a down boot. Yeah, like they're not getting better at what they're doing. Like I'm sure they're decent animators. They probably show them a cool portfolio. I think it's more or less they want to be like, I work on South Park.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:51:07.270 --> 1:51:07.557]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:51:08.772 --> 1:51:09.295]: 
  Yeah, let's go.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:51:15.674 --> 1:51:16.500]: 
  No, but like,

 SPEAKER_02 [1:51:18.559 --> 1:51:20.500]: 
  What if you look at some of the episodes with

 SPEAKER_01 [1:51:20.500 --> 1:51:23.909]: 
  have like comic book style or like the episode with the boobs they maybe like the

 SPEAKER_02 [1:51:23.909 --> 1:51:31.975]: 
  when it's like the heavy metal style. Like when they want to go out, the animators, like sometimes they give the animators free run, they say do it over the fuck you want. And it looks really good.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:51:31.975 --> 1:52:38.024]: 
  Yeah, and like the storyboard artists are all really good too. Like they have a really unique cartoony style. And then you see like these fucking like stiff cardboard cutouts, but you see like they're like very cartoony, like dynamically animated like angles and stuff. But then it's just like... Even the characters of a celebrity is always like really spot on. It's always really good at that. I do think... I think it's one of those things where it's like, yeah, I work on South Park. It's like one of the most beloved shows that everyone... Like you either hate or enjoy it, but most people enjoy it. The only criticism I have of the art, there's somebody on that staff that is a huge fan of Street Fighter and they trace a lot of Street Fighter art. Really? Only the Street Fighter? Yes. What episode? The one... The one from Planet Idiot? Just... Farnitrarrs. The episode... You know the episode where they turn into anime characters? Oh yeah. So many fucking trees, like all the Street Fighter app art. Really? Yes. They didn't want to do the extra... Yes. I recognize it. They didn't want to do the extra work. Not only that, and then the three-part episode where they did all the villains or whatever, whatever that was called. Somebody like traced Akuma and stuck them in the back. It was like a tracing of Akuma!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:51:43.315 --> 1:51:43.720]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:51 --> 1:51:57.709]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:53:30.353 --> 1:54:16.962]: 
  Joking but like after you do like frame-by-frame stuff and you do like a lot of like stuff you look at the other stuff There's a character from Street Fighter Alpha called Sodom and he has like this armored outfit Go look at his design go look at his art and then go watch that episode of South Park the anime episode And you'll be like holy shit. They traced them dude I'm telling you right now I was watching the show and I swear to God I was catching like light flickers in fucking like 3d animation and like if a character like moved his hand and his hand was here like I noticed and it's everything It's crazy that like you're so used to working on stuff and you're so used to like Animating and catching like frames that are off a little bit and you have to go back and fix it That you start to catch this and I was watching something and it give it a rain man I was watching you like movie like frame one thousand thirty four. There was a misplacement

 SPEAKER_00 [1:53:36.782 --> 1:53:36.968]: 
  there's

 SPEAKER_03 [1:53:58.399 --> 1:54:01.521]: 
  Oh, I noticed. I noticed everything.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:54:16.742 --> 1:54:23.003]: 
  I was watching Family Guy years ago and I saw the, what are the early episodes from season one where death comes in.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:54:23.003 --> 1:54:28.437]: 
  with Donald and you know that you do were like a character's part of their body goes off the stage

 SPEAKER_02 [1:54:28.437 --> 1:55:02.001]: 
  So you take like a light when you draw under I saw it's we have to post pictures It's so hard to describe if you're not a man, but basically what there's a stage in flash And there's a great area outside the white stage and the great area Nobody can see except for the animator and I just mean something come in and go off the stage But anyways in the actual animation there was like lines drawn But they into the stage by accident So it was like where the characters legs we cop would start to come up at the bottom of the screen Yeah, I posted a video I'll post it in the description of this video

 SPEAKER_01 [1:54:58.778 --> 1:55:37.793]: 
  Dude, I'm telling you, I catch that stuff now. Get a check, I was like one tenth of a second, I saw it, I fucking saw it. And stuff like, you ever notice in old, like for example, like a movie Akira, their frames are that people mispainted something on one frame? Yes. Dude, old-ish old? And it bugs me, it flashes like, something's the wrong color or they didn't- Old 80s anime do that a lot. Yeah, they fuck up a lot. Like, they're like doing, they're doing like a very like detailed thing and there's a movement, but the background's fucking disappeared and it's just like, where an area of ground would be and like half the picture's missing, you're like, wait, what the fuck? Because it's like, it's all like, hand-painted, isn't it? Yeah, all the cells get, yeah, somebody messes up little things.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:55:11.232 --> 1:55:13.645]: 
  on waterframe. Yes, dude, old dude, old dude.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:55:44.543 --> 1:55:49.437]: 
  Or like their hair isn't colored or their hair isn't shaded on one frame.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:55:49.319 --> 1:55:52.457]: 
  Or it's like a skin color or something by accident. Yeah, like it's a piece of cake.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:55:51.715 --> 1:56:17.112]:
