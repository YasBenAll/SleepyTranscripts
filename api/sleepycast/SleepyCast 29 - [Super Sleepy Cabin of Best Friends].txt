No, I need that chocolate later on. It's very ancient.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:57.449 --> 0:02:59.946]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:48.132 --> 0:04:54.055]: 
  cream. The only way you could ever taste that cream was from a big chocolate weiner.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:53.667 --> 0:05:00.484]: 
  Okay, shit, it's not attached to a, you know what, it is attached to my purse already deep-throating.

  It's attached to my purse already.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:01.581 --> 0:05:55.446]: 
  Like straight into my stomach. You didn't flinch! Just straight into the- I thought about that! Chocolate wiener, who cares? I have wiener chocolate. When they had those Cadbury Cream Egg McFlurries at McDonald's- Are you like the wiener- wait, the wiener's chocolate? Yeah, let's go! So you could bite the wiener and eat the chocolate too? Yeah, but there's a guy like the early side, because the wiener's got- Yeah, don't give people ideas. Like his wiener just crumbles and melts? Yeah, he walks away sad. They had Cadbury Cream Egg McFlurries at McDonald's, and I went in there and I was like, you'll fuck the chocolate, double down on the cream. Give me that gender, like are you sure? He pitched a 10, like in the McDonald's, it just slipped. Like I almost- I think I'm at risk for diabetes, just because of that. I'm about to lose a toe, I don't fucking care. You can call it nasty, give me that cream egg den. I've never seen someone so solidly- Dude, I don't give a fuck. That's all different perspective. I would take it in a McFlurry or a- what's it, a Blizzard idea? I'd take that. If you lost your toe, you could just put a cream egg on it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:05.462 --> 0:05:08.669]: 
  You thought about it. I'm a chocolate winner. Who cares?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:05.496 --> 0:05:05.817]:

  I know, wait, the wieners chocolate? Yeah, let's go!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:14.760 --> 0:05:15.250]: 
  You have the

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:37.491 --> 0:05:39.449]: 
  I'm about to lose a toe, I don't fucking care.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:44.022 --> 0:05:46.047]: 
  I don't do that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:51.480 --> 0:05:52.814]:

What are your like first names? Cause that's... I only just learned them all. Internet slang, that's weird. You see that's the thing like... To step back a couple of steps, I met you guys before I even knew who you were. Right. And before I even knew, again, like your first names or any of that. So I met you as human beings first, then I knew what you did. And I still don't know your first names. I just, I say, hey, how's it going? It's their best friend's mother.

But the storyline behind that, just one second, was that there's a disposable out of venting machines, you get disposable assassin robots, and this one robot is supposed to destroy this one target and is supposed to self-destruct afterwards, but it finds out because it's antlers in its back and it sees it in a mirror, so it doesn't. Anyways, instead of killing its target, it blows off all of its limbs and then for a good chunk of the story, its job is to become a freelance mercenary and to pay the hospital bills to keep its target alive.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:51.389 --> 0:31:53.819]: 
  Yes, PlayStation 1 gave him the comic.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:25.257 --> 0:32:30.724]: 
  Which is a great fucking idea because he will self-destructive his target dies so he is like go and do all these odd

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:29.982 --> 0:32:52.493]: 
  Go and do all these odd jobs, but anyways that was just the beginning of it There's like zombie burn Franklin and everything's easily one of my favorite fucking comics ever It's called scud the disposable assassin and they have like scud light and they had like all these other things He's like a yellow like he's a yellow robot. He's the heartbreaker series. I've heard of that. Yeah Yeah, there was a game that were like really bombed and they tried to do some other stuff with it They tried to push him. Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:36.597 --> 0:32:39.128]: 
  That's right, it's been a long, long time. It's called scud...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:42.908 --> 0:32:48.949]: 
  He's like a yellow like he's a yellow robot. He's the heartbreaker series wait. I'm heard of that. Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:51.194 --> 0:32:57.505]: 
  He tried to push him. Yeah, and he like, I don't know, it was very meta and like it had a whole bunch of, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:57.505 --> 0:33:05.942]: 
  It was really fucking cool. You find out at spoilers that his first target is And then that's the government

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:03.479 --> 0:33:25.939]: 
  That's a good target. And then that's the government's character. Somebody define Meta. I'm so tired of hearing that word. Really? It's so referential. It's so referential. Okay. Like Deadpool is Meta. Oh. He talks to the viewer. He talks to the viewer. He knows he's in a comic. It's like a movie that knows it's a movie. Self-aware. Like a horror movie that is clearly aware that it's a horror movie. I hear everyone using that and it never makes sense. Well, it's probably like triggered. People are probably using it wrong.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:05.942 --> 0:33:07.225]: 
  It's not my define matter.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:08.811 --> 0:33:09.452]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:09.452 --> 0:33:10.448]: 
  Refore�shell.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:14.363 --> 0:33:15.443]: 
  He knows he's having a fight.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:15.443 --> 0:33:16.455]: 
  the comic.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:25.686 --> 0:33:27.492]: 
  They just fucking throwing it all over the fucking shit.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:27.492 --> 0:33:54.795]: 
  So if you're in the kitchen in the morning and you're like, and Mitt goes in the kitchen and makes himself some scrambled eggs, wow, these taste like shit. I don't know, is that meta? That might be meta, like you talking to your kid? I don't know, man. Just tell me yourself. It's schizophrenic or something. If people are in your kitchen watching you make that, and they expect that to be what you're doing, then yes, it's meta. If you're playing Metal Gear and they say, put your controller down and let it rumble, that's meta. Because it's referencing that. It's a lot of it. Where does the actual word meta come from? I don't know. Not a night, duh.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:32.487 --> 0:33:38.055]: 
  These taste like shit. I don't know, is that meta? That might be meta, like you talking to your friend? I don't know man, you just told me yourself. That's just a friend. That's just a friend.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:36.452 --> 0:33:36.992]: 
  Tell me a story.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:42.814 --> 0:33:43.101]: 
  Oh.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:48.501 --> 0:33:50.948]: 
  because it's referencing that it's a lot of it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:56.567 --> 0:34:21.440]: 
  Is that true? No. Sharp as a whip this one. And I leave this conversation knowing nothing more than I did when I stepped into it. Literally explained it as best as I could. Yeah, you picked on me. It just means referencing. Oh, so basically I could just use it anyway I want to. Alright, that door is fucking messy. Everything looks like it. You don't even know. It's like last night, when you grabbed your wiener and you started jacking off and you looked at it and you were like, I'm jacking off and you screamed really loud and everyone in the house heard you. That was like,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:59.352 --> 0:33:59.925]: 
  Who's a whiff this?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:03.992 --> 0:34:07.840]: 
  than I did when I stepped into it. We literally explained it as best as we could.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:21.440 --> 0:34:22.065]: 
  That was better.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:22.926 --> 0:34:25.726]: 
  I'm just kidding that's not meta. This is gay.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:24.748 --> 0:34:46.568]: 
  I didn't know where that was going but I really liked it. I didn't know where it was going either. It was going over here. Thanks man. Stay meta bro. Alright, now that we know each other's names, it's only took an hour.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:36.494 --> 0:34:36.543]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:40.560 --> 0:34:42.552]: 
  Thanks man, stay mad a bro.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:41.505 --> 0:34:41.944]: 
  Stay metal.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:48.002 --> 0:34:53.047]: 
  Not even. Next, volume two. Yeah, volume two. Wait, what, we're all your names again? OK.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:53.047 --> 0:34:55.579]: 
  Let's go back. I actually see my nails. Thanks man.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:55.579 --> 0:35:05.451]: 
  piss dick shit ass butt ass butt you know you brought it on you brought up something earlier you said something like you said we're let's players and we're the scum of the

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:05.451 --> 0:35:11.391]: 
  the earth and there's a special place in hell and I don't know why you said all of

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:08.168 --> 0:35:23.929]: 
  I don't know why you said all of that, but I'm curious. I think let's players are good if they're funny and you guys are obviously funny. Thank you. Thank you. You're very nice. You think? Yeah, I know. I'm just trying to talk to you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:11.290 --> 0:35:11.712]: 
  listen

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:18.360 --> 0:35:19.491]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:19.491 --> 0:35:21.499]: 
  You think? Yeah, I know!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:21.499 --> 0:35:43.285]: 
  I'm starting to talk to you. What's funny, what's actually funny is that I don't watch any of your Let's Play shit. What I do watch is all the outside shit you do, like the video stuff you do. Even the box opening shit that you guys do. I guess that's kind of like, I don't know for me, like I don't really give a shit about Let's Play but I love to see the personalities behind the people that do that. This is what I was talking about earlier. It was like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:22.444 --> 0:35:22.495]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:39.994 --> 0:35:40.028]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:41.074 --> 0:36:09.897]: 
  This is what I was talking about earlier. It was like, I don't really follow your work either. And you could probably say the same for me, but I'm happy to see you and go out to a bar and we just hang out and talk. So I clicked on it. I know you more like that than with work. That's the human thing. That's right. You're a skit fighter. I was listening. Yeah, Mr. Skit Fighter. That's true. Let's go skit, man. I was listening to the show not long ago. And I heard what basically was what amounted to you being like, look, man, you don't

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:50.085 --> 0:35:51.452]: 
  So I clicked on it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:55.452 --> 0:35:57.510]: 
  That's right, you're a ski fighter.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:59.890 --> 0:36:00.953]: 
  Hey, let's go.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:01.611 --> 0:36:02.809]: 
  I was just like, I was just like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:04.227 --> 0:36:05.087]: 
  go in like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:09.897 --> 0:36:14.959]: 
  to fucking unsubscribe if nothing is showing up in your in when you're in thank you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:14.217 --> 0:36:40.440]: 
  Thank you, man. Just fucking wait and a cartoon will happen, right? And I remember you're losing it like that and I was like, oh god damn If you are an animator that puts this hard work into this one thing and it shows up once every couple months If not like a couple few times a year. Yeah, that's fucking rough. Well, right? Whereas the let's play people are like, hey, yo, we just played Dark Souls. That's like 80 parts. What up? Yeah, but you guys also know live-action shit and you guys do something like the dubbing stuff for the cartoons and stuff I feel like it's

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:40.440 --> 0:36:45.098]: 
  The people that we end up respecting the most are the people that explore a lot of shit too.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:45.081 --> 0:37:38.811]: 
  Because that's a constant thing where people will ask, like, how do you get into less plays? Well, the thing about less plays is that don't actually diversify a little bit, because you never know when the bubble might burst. If you have a personality that's interesting, then you can fucking make it work. It's really all it is. It's not less plays, it's not anything like that. It's all personalities, really. It's just human personalities. You think it, it doesn't even have to be video games. It could be, you know, I'm waiting for the time where everyone starts less listening, and it's just listening to the radio, and then everyone's gonna migrate to that. It's all about just having a personality. But it just happens to be a format, where it's like, you're playing a game, so it's like, oh, that can be extended for however long. And that's why I feel bad, because these fucking cartoons are hilarious, but people need everyday content. Yeah, you know what's interesting too, is I feel like that, the whole- People think they need everyday content. With the whole people spoiled. The opposite side of that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:55.257 --> 0:36:55.949]: 
  고르면

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:55.949 --> 0:36:56.624]: 
  Never does.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:59.070 --> 0:37:00.555]: 
  It's really all it is. It's not like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:13.465 --> 0:37:14.444]: 
  and it's just listening to me.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:14.444 --> 0:37:15.625]: 
  They're the radio.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:21.649 --> 0:37:22.442]: 
  Before I mark your names!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:30.829 --> 0:37:30.914]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:34.086 --> 0:37:35.993]: 
  People think they need everyday content.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:35.993 --> 0:37:37.647]: 
  What the whole people spoiled?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:38.811 --> 0:37:54.960]: 
  spectrum is so fucking clear when certain people do like update videos or comment videos about a certain topic like let's say it's about gay marriage or whatever but the whole time they have like some fucking Call of Duty gameplay footage playing the entire time it's like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:52.935 --> 0:38:17.944]: 
  the entire fucking time. It's like you clearly just want to see some visual stimulation just for the- it doesn't even matter what it is! You look at dancing colors in front of your face while I talk to you. Give me a bat bat explosion. A review tech USA. This guy has topics where exactly. He's pretty popular channel and he just talks about whatever but there happens to be Call of Duty playing. Right. And I think that is actually a very serious question.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:00.462 --> 0:38:01.035]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:15.649 --> 0:38:28.440]: 
  Right, and I think that is actually a very successful psychological experiment where it actually kind of you know Hones in on the fact that people just want to see shit moving around while they listen to something do it

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:28.440 --> 0:38:47.003]: 
  main that's like Street Fighter hitbox is when you get really big in a street fighter you start seeing people play the game without graphics right they're cubes moving around so they start to understand it's like the matrix it's the matrix it's all just friend and they're just like oh the seriously geometrical shapes moving around the screen it's yeah then on the other side of that

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:36.169 --> 0:38:37.148]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:38.144 --> 0:38:39.443]: 
  It's the Matrix.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:39.443 --> 0:38:40.067]: 
  It's frame data.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:47.003 --> 0:38:51.441]: 
  it's because possibly people aren't even paying attention to the visuals at the end of the day.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:51.441 --> 0:39:11.033]: 
  They're listening to us. So many people, so many comments constantly go, yeah, I turn the LP on and then go about my day. And then, yeah, I don't even look at the videos. They just turn the volume up and that's it. Yeah. Like for live action stuff, though, it's kind of a weird thing because when we do that, we usually do it for content videos. Like here, we're at Too Many Games and we did a video. You did just a video.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:56.200 --> 0:39:00.959]: 
  about my day. Yeah, I don't even look at the visuals. They just turn the volume up and that's it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:57.938 --> 0:38:58.410]: 
  E até o próximo vídeo, até a próxima!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:59.440 --> 0:38:59.997]: 
  I'm glad you're here.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:10.307 --> 0:39:13.665]: 
  If you didn't just do it for comedy, I saw plenty of videos. No, no, yeah, but...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:12.315 --> 0:39:46.217]: 
  No, no, yeah, but traditionally that's where we'll be spurred to make one But for too many games I we made one that was maybe like was considered too real and too raw And that was us it was us fighting over chocolate chip cookies stamper. What happened to that video? Mr. Skeet fighter this would be meta because it was us Arguing over what would be a good video to make for the car That's exactly what meta is you were watching exactly what that is

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:41.627 --> 0:39:43.450]: 
  That's exactly what meta is.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:42.505 --> 0:39:49.407]: 
  Exactly what meta is. You were watching. That's exactly what meta is. That's textbook. You know what? This is all bullshit.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:47.044 --> 0:40:08.594]: 
  You know what? This is all bullshit. This is like no, no, no. That's a definition. Stop, Corey, shut the fuck up. Oh my god. You sassy, sassy frass. People arguing about meta is exactly like people arguing over what ironic means. It's always so up and down. Oh really? Really? Yes, really. Okay, fucking.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:50.655 --> 0:39:51.263]: 
  That's a death.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:53.710 --> 0:39:55.380]: 
  Oh my god!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:03.818 --> 0:40:04.155]: 
  means.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:05.640 --> 0:40:05.995]: 
  Oh, really?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:05.995 --> 0:40:06.923]: 
  Really? Really?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:08.594 --> 0:40:11.462]: 
  Wait, what you were saying about, um, you, you're, I can- Or maybe I just-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:10.838 --> 0:40:20.794]: 
  Or maybe I just don't get it. Maybe I'm stupid. No, you're not. Shut up. I'm stupid. Chris, you were saying? You are stupid. It's always a possibility. Your weird is too huge to be stupid. Alright.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:13.690 --> 0:40:16.491]: 
  Shut up. I'm stupid. I'm stupid. Chris, you were saying? You are stupid.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:16.491 --> 0:40:17.267]: 
  It's impossible.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:18.482 --> 0:40:34.429]: 
  Your weird is too huge to be stupid. You guys were talking earlier about this bubble of let's players could burst at any moment, right? Yeah. I mean, Zach, we're talking about this where it's like, we think it's good if a let's player has something to fall back on. If you're just literally, that's all you can do, it could like end at any point. Yeah, that's right.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:34.075 --> 0:42:14.093]: 
  Most Let's Players are gonna fall back on Walmart, my friend. That's why I was scared to death. And I was like, we gotta diversify. And there's something that, like, if you guys have been looking at our stuff for a little while, we haven't seen it in a long, long time, but we just did a cartoon series called Best Friends Adventures, where it's me and my cohort Pat getting like thrown into different game worlds. And we were just like, oh, now we're in doom. Now we're in Mortal Kombat. And we had a really like the most talent, that you're all talented. You're not as talented as this guy. Yeah, this Brazilian Superman. What's his name? True Snacks. We found him because he enjoys the My Little Pony, and he did My Little Pony versions of taking our audio from our left place and making just really, really amazing, like some 3D animation. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is this the Two Snacks? Wait, wait, who was the one who did your Avatar arts? The main Avatar, which I was assuming that you were talking about, is like, yeah, he designed the Snacks. Yeah, yeah, I know him. I had many a conversation with Tisnack. So we're going into double winner. Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's his name? Remember Two and Snacks. Like as in eating snacks. Like treats, snacks with an X. So he's at numeral two snacks. That seems to be the case. Shut up, Nick. God damn it, I'm trying to do some proper goddamn promotion for people. I need more vodka. Fuck you. I'm gonna take my head off. Well. So you'll say to the guy. Hey, stop, who am I? Oh, they can't see that. I know. Good visual. You'll say to the guy. That was totally meta, right guys? No, not. Yeah, right? You're making me all really horny.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:35.324 --> 0:40:37.939]: 
  They're gonna fall back on Walmart, my friend.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:53.498 --> 0:40:54.089]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:03.454 --> 0:41:08.449]: 
  Yeah, this Brazilian Superman. What's his name? True Snacks.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:20.481 --> 0:41:21.257]: 
  I can't believe it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:26.843 --> 0:41:30.724]: 
  Yeah, that's the same guy in the specs. Yeah, I know him.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:33.593 --> 0:41:34.791]: 
  That's so cool.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:36.833 --> 0:41:39.955]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's useful to remember to

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:43.499 --> 0:41:44.798]: 
  Next with an exit the end

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:44.730 --> 0:41:45.507]: 
  He's so easy.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:45.507 --> 0:41:45.709]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:47.717 --> 0:41]: 
  I believe so.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:48.831 --> 0:41:54.096]: 
  Shut up, Nick! Shut up! God damn it! I'm trying to do some proper goddamn promotion for people!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:54.872 --> 0:41:54.957]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:05.689 --> 0:42:05.790]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:06.482 --> 0:42:07.950]: 
  You'll say to the guy

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:14.920 --> 0:42:36.570]: 
  That's mad. We're going to Devil May Cry World. So do us some Devil May Cry things. Here's a script and I give him a script. And then he rips out Bayonetta's model from the game code and puts it in there and animates it. And then it's voice and it's lip synced to whatever. And I didn't ask for that. That's way better. So you guys hire me?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:17.721 --> 0:42:18.852]: 
  Crywater....

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:35.625 --> 0:42:42.494]: 
  So you guys hired the lawnmower man to be your animator. It's nuts. That's fucking stupid. Has it been? Has it been?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:38.528 --> 0:42:56.922]: 
  It's nuts. That's fucking good. Has it been a well received and successful series? Yeah, and people like, it took so long because you're one man guy and you did so, so much and added to the humor and did all these things. No definitive ending yet though. I appreciate that you spend money to do this.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:56.922 --> 0:42:59.504]: 
  to make stuff that's good like that, right?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:59.504 --> 0:44:18.006]: 
  So I just thought it would be fun. You will have an audience to fall back on if it burst. Yeah, if video games are over tomorrow. Yeah. We just did a movie review thing that you tried out with the movie reviews that we have of Jurassic Park and shit. So Jurassic Park and Terminator, both have movies coming up. So yeah, do like, sit, let's play videos for the week, and then you end off the week by going, okay, here's a live action, just round table review of the movie, because what have we learned up to this point? We played all these games, and now we've watched the movie. And now what do you think? Wow, this sounds like a fucking classroom. We're like, yeah, you did, you read the books. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You read the book report. Yeah, yeah, yeah. By the way, he specifically wanted to keep topics not based on a given time, because you gotta have a replayability. You gotta have people keep cookings. You know? Dude, you don't want to pull something out of the past and then be like, oh, there's new movies coming out and people are like, oh no. We have a very interesting podcast where as soon as we click stop and record shit tons of news happens, and our podcast is ludicrously out of date every time. Dude, what are you talking about, man? Everything's got an expiration date on it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:01.073 --> 0:43:01.225]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:03.655 --> 0:43:04.245]: 
  It's video game.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:05.494 --> 0:43:06.186]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:17.138 --> 0:43:18.252]: 
  Let's play video games.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:32.174 --> 0:43:32.494]: 
  느낌이 좋습니다,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:32.494 --> 0:43:33.827]: 
  This sounds like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:36.443 --> 0:43]: 
  room.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:39.244 --> 0:43:40.358]: 
  a good laptop!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:40.358 --> 0:43:41.944]: 
  He's like, good thing, and now.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:41.944 --> 0:43:43.817]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:50.061 --> 0:43:52.947]: 
  You gotta have people keep cookies.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:11.222 --> 0:44:12.960]: 
  I update every time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:15.137 --> 0:44:17.095]: 
  It's got an expiration date on it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:18.006 --> 0:44:26.005]: 
  You're saying like during a podcast stop recorder done and literally the second you did that news the world change

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:23.997 --> 0:45:44.204]: 
  The world change. News happens. We'll give an opinion on like, oh this game has been canceled, that sucks. Oh, we'll never see that game again. We hit stop and then we'll go that game's back on. On sale now. On sale now. And everyone's like, wow, this must be a very outdated podcast. We're like, no, it's just, it's like the last like six months have just been super rough. So I've always been completely against bringing up current events, movies that are about to come out because you know, you always want to be able to revisit things. Do you think it's more beneficial that you constantly talk about current news in a sense where you can kind of revisit it? You have a valid point because there's some comedians where you can listen to their material timeless and other comedians where the bit is based on current events and whatnot. Like if it's Dan Cook talking about my phone doesn't work. That's retarded. But if you if you listen to Eddie Murphy raw, it's fucking epic. Why was that also? And you know what? Raw was it really? I was just thinking that's we're the same person. As you said earlier, like people grab Karlin bits and play them today and people go, how do you know? Yeah, raw. Yeah, raw. Yeah, raw. Three out of 10. What the fuck are you talking about? Three out of 10. I love pushing. I like getting pushing. That's his whole fucking routine.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:35.455 --> 0:44:37.260]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:01.375 --> 0:45:02.235]: 
  revisiting

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:12.344 --> 0:45:14.537]: 
  That's retarded.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:17.997 --> 0:45:21.439]: 
  It's fucking medicine! Why was that also... And you know what?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:21.439 --> 0:45:24.561]: 
  Wrong voice. Was it really? Yeah, I was just thinking that's a

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:26.130 --> 0:45:29.117]: 
  As you said earlier, Luke and Pee Bag.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:33.015 --> 0:45:35.310]:

I'm so sorry you you you the thing is is pretty meta though

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:36.784 --> 0:48:37.442]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:37.493 --> 0:48:38.303]: 
  And I can't say...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:39.839 --> 0:48:41.864]: 
  And someone was saying that some of the sound effects...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:47.483 --> 0:48:49.002]: 
  Like the first like five seconds.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:49.002 --> 0:48:50.099]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:52.039 --> 0:48:55.583]: 
  That's what Sony Vegas is really nice for like dragging it to the left.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:58.620 --> 0:48:59.245]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:02.350 --> 0:49:02.940]: 
  Great.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:02.502 --> 0:49:04.763]: 
  Oh shit dude, we're making out.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:04.510 --> 0:49:06.096]: 
  defined

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:08.560 --> 0:49:09.117]: 
  I know it's a...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:15.175 --> 0:49:20.153]: 
  That was close! That statement was close to that!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:15.951 --> 0:51:39.743]: 
  That's close! That statement was close to that! Now we're getting there! Yes! Now we're getting there! We already know the name of this podcast! That's pretty mad up! Are you done, Faggot? No! When you're saying, like, okay, do we have, like, is it better if we have no time references to what's going on at current events? The problem is our fucking podcast is what did we do with our weeks? What current games did we play? And then what news is happening? What's coming out on the channel? Our podcast, we'd have no material if we didn't have current events. If we don't talk about, like, a piece of news that's, like, relevant to us, let's say, we really like Yakuza games. If a Yakuza game gets announced or localized or whatever, we will get all of us, all of our Twitter's, all of our whatever's, will be like, what the fuck, I'm gonna unsubscribe. Oh, you missed the news, yeah. Because they didn't talk about Yakuza or whatever. That's because we designed it that way. Our podcast, at least, is locked onto a calendar. You're gonna have audience members who want to hear the latest news. You're gonna get audience members that love to listen to a Led Zeppelin album. They want to hear, like, you know... Are they looking for news or commentary or friendship? A lot of people listen to podcasts, but they're also familiar with the news. I think it could be all the columns. I remember back in the day, OneUp did a show called Broken Pixels, which is basically a let's playing, kind of before let's playing happened, where they just played some shitty game, and they did a cool thing where they took a, like, an art of a TV monitor, like the outside of an old one, and they would make it look like their reflections were overlaid on top of the game footage. Like, they were... Wait, the camera was pointing at their TV. Yeah, like, MSD3? No, not really. The idea was that they were playing an old CRT, and the camera was pointing at the TV, and you could see the reflections in the CRT screen. It was a really cool show. It is meta! That is meta! That is meta! That's meta! We'll get you there yet. And they were playing a Congo game, based on the Michael Crichton novel for the second Saturn, and they were making fucking Congo jokes. Like, man, Congo is a shitty movie. That was from 1996. Well, you never move, Anthony Hawkins! I can always laugh at Congo! Was that Anthony Hawkins? Uh, no, that's another movie with a primal. But Congo is about the laser beams that sawed all the monkeys in half. That's fucking radical.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:48.975 --> 0:49:49.870]: 
  If we don't talk...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:04.163 --> 0:50:07.943]: 
  subscribe because they didn't talk about yakuza or whatever that

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:07.943 --> 0:50:08.264]: 
  That's my...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:08.264 --> 0:50:10.491]: 
  because we are designed that way.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:13.748 --> 0:50:13.849]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:27.940 --> 0:50:30.960]: 
  It's a little bit of a problem with the quality.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:52.358 --> 0:50:56.442]: 
  Wait, like, the camera was pointing at their teeth. No, not...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:04.997 --> 0:51:05.942]: 
  of the players.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:05.942 --> 0:51:06.499]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:06.499 --> 0:51:11.157]: 
  Screen it was really cool show like is met that is met up

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:11.157 --> 0:51:12.287]: 
  That's meta!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:26.530 --> 0:51:27.492]: 
  and they'll all release them and delete it from your absence.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:27.492 --> 0:51:28.622]: 
  your kitty hawks.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:38.747 --> 0:51:38.950]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:42.274 --> 0:52:41.505]: 
  Whoa! That's what he did. You take out your phone, you're like, I'm gonna watch this right now. So like for a podcast, or even if it's like an old show like that, those broken facials or whatever, I'm like, I'll listen to you make fun of Congo. But if it's like a current event, like I can get what you're saying, we're like, yeah, gay marriage that happened like three weeks ago, because lots of people go, I'm finally caught up on your podcast and you're talking about shit that's three weeks old. And that's where we kind of go like, yeah, does that feel weird? I don't mean it. It's funny, I think people are gonna like it. No, it's fine. But it's just mindset where it's like, it's always a transitional period. Like for example, I'll go home and watch fucking Batman Returns or any old fucking anything. Yeah, fucking everything. So does like the podcast and like this whole world apply to that? Like the people like to pull up things from the past that don't. You know what though, I can already tell. It's like referential. No, from what you're saying. And it didn't occur to me until now. Do you only care about the people that are presenting it? Hold on.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:10.354 --> 0:52:11.333]: 
  Does that feel weird?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:12.109 --> 0:52:13.155]: 
  That's a little bit...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:15.062 --> 0:52:16.193]: 
  That's fine, you know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:24.664 --> 0:52:26.487]: 
  Yeah, fuck yeah, that restricts.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:35.414 --> 0:52:36.899]: 
  No, from what you're saying...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:41.505 --> 0:53:00.507]: 
  But you come at it as an animator, which is if you create an animation, right? You're gonna spend a month making that thing. And if you make it just based on some whatever hashtag that's happening, that it dissipates the moment you fucking execute it, right? But if you're an animator, right, you want to create something that despite

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:00.507 --> 0:53:04.759]: 
  Yeah, maybe it is somewhat related to what's going on right now, but this is the thing that's going to

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:04.759 --> 0:53:07.476]: 
  gonna last because you're gonna put your fucking heart behind this

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:07.240 --> 0:53:14.766]: 
  This is what every content creator should do. I understand, but like how we putter, right, Chris? Right, but what I'm saying is, is it that...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:09.518 --> 0:53:10.446]: 
  I said but

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:10.446 --> 0:53:12.505]: 
  Like Harry Potter, right, Christian?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:12.505 --> 0:53:27.912]: 
  Right, but what I'm saying is that mentality is the exact same mentality as an animator, right? Yeah. Rather than, let's say, like a vlogger who's like, well, this is what's happening today, so... Vloggers is a thing that I can see.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:23.355 --> 0:53:40.180]: 
  This is what's happening today so well. V-Loggers is a thing that I can see. That's the end of this is totally someone being like why would I watch this again? Right. No, no, no. That's what I'm saying. It's pretty much the base question. But that is the exact opposite. That is the immediate like you will immediately watch that and never watch that episode.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:36.990 --> 0:53:38.189]: 
  You will immediately want to

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:40.180 --> 0:53:44.939]: 
  episode of that V-logger again because who fucking cares that was the immediate 10 minutes of whatever

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:44.939 --> 0:53:55.992]: 
  fucking happen maybe there's a that's like feeding fish food it's just like constantly oh that's part of but TLC or TLC maybe there's a chance someone in the future

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:49.140 --> 0:53:49.444]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:49.444 --> 0:53:49.630]: 
  Vai.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:52.566 --> 0:53:55.097]: 
  But where do you draw the line? And maybe there's a chance

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:55.992 --> 0:54:03.045]: 
  future is like, ah, like this piece of fucking garbage came out and I want to hear about like opinions of it before it came out to sea like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:03.045 --> 0:55:13.296]: 
  have people are hiding for something, maybe then I would watch it. Conkro. At the same time, the podcast is supplementary to Let's Plays, which are things that people constantly re-watch. Well, yeah. They re-watch games that they love, that we've played through all the time. Right? So it's like, if they... That's true. So there's the main content that still is totally timeless, because you can grab any one of these things and watch a game that you like just playing again. But the podcast is the podcast. It's a separate thing from that. It serves a different purpose. I've seen people go like, I really... Your play through of Deadly Premonition, let's first say, was like, it made me laugh so much. That was fun. I would watch that again. I don't see a lot of people saying like, I listened to your podcast again, because there's always one every week. So why would I go back to... Unless it's like one with a really good bit. Maybe not your podcast. No, no, that's actually really interesting, because I think that is actually the opposite of how a lot of people... Hold on. Yeah, you get it on those Osabi peas. Dude, you're fucking so good. I'm sorry. I was trying to be quiet. No, just fucking do it. Now you college you're at. They're delicious. They're fucking great. Let me just say this. Wasabi peas. Alright, okay, okay. So that is the opposite.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:11.804 --> 0:54:12.225]: 
  But yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:16.343 --> 0:54:17.457]: 
  so it's like the if they

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:29.185 --> 0:54:29.202]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:36.525 --> 0:54:38.078]: 
  It made me laugh so much.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:46.650 --> 0:54:48.591]: 
  aCI.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:49.232 --> 0:54:50.127]: 
  Maybe

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:51.359 --> 0:54:51.949]: 
  Melhor!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:51.949 --> 0:54:52.506]: 
  News!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:59.222 --> 0:55:03.053]: 
  You left our fucking so good. I'm sorry. They're so good. I was trying to be quiet. No, just.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:06.074 --> 0:55:06.597]: 
  There's a book.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:06.597 --> 0:55:07.187]: 
  great

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:07.187 --> 0:55:07.913]: 
  We can see this.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:13.296 --> 0:55:29.007]: 
  opposite in terms of what we were trying to do before which was like the timelessness of a podcast that you could tune in at any point in time and that it would seem- Or a show or a movie or anything. Yeah, but it would appear timeless in terms of like, oh,

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:24.990 --> 0:55:25.817]: 
  We are any.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:29.007 --> 0:55:35.993]: 
  We're not giving it any kind of referential political situation or Twitter trend or I don't

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:35.993 --> 0:55:39.975]: 
  I feel like no matter what we do, you know, it comes up from time to time

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:38.474 --> 0:55:41.545]: 
  It comes up from time to time. Right. Current references.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:39.975 --> 0:55:41.258]: 
  Right. Current references.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:41.258 --> 0:55:46.506]: 
  Well, not only that, but if you're trying to avoid a current reference, it's still going to come up in some way.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:46.506 --> 0:55:53.492]: 
  someway you know what I mean like I just feel like it's a waste of airspace is waste of time for something that if we're gonna sit there

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:53.492 --> 0:56:00.782]: 
  talk about right the latest trend I absolutely agree but I think if it comes up that it's not necessarily like a fucking sin

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:00.327 --> 0:56:19.007]: 
  You don't strike me as a type of guys that had a podcast where you're like is the sweater blue No, but awesome no, I never talked about it. No, but in regards to what you If you guys if there was a new cast of

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:10.671 --> 0:56:10.739]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:13.506 --> 0:56:13.911]: 
  Good.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:14.940 --> 0:56:15.227]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:19.007 --> 0:56:22.332]: 
  any game or new whatever that's what you guys would be on time.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:22.332 --> 0:57:09.936]: 
  And it's and it's almost our obligation right right right We'll see what's not necessarily though because sometimes a new thing comes out We don't give a shit like or I'm just not interested like the new Batman game came out I don't really care because I got out of those super hard after the second one This is like the 13th but in in three years But if it's something that comes out that people know we care about that shit then like they're gonna expect They're gonna expect that there's a part two tense on it Right and I'm always on the fence about that too because I want to avoid it But at the same time you still pick it up and play it I mean you can go to a game stop and pick it up and play it if you really care about it It's not like the game's gonna disappear off the face of the planet It's just a concern, you know like I don't know the danger is is that if you're doing a podcast for the most part But a podcast is like fresh milk

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:26.027 --> 0:56:27.192]: 
  We'll see what you do.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:45.535 --> 0:56:47.543]: 
  We're gonna expect that. And I'm always on the- And I'm always on the-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:00.385 --> 0:57:01.077]: 
  Oh shit they're not

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:09.936 --> 0:57:14.492]: 
  Like, it does have an expiration date, but in a lot of cases, that is...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:14.492 --> 0:57:26.001]: 
  is what a podcast is. Most podcasts are current news, right? Right, exactly. For the most part? Exactly. And it's like, if you listen to it three weeks later, you're listening to shit that is kind of

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:18.424 --> 0:57:19.994]: 
  Right, exactly.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:19.994 --> 0:57:20.500]: 
  It's like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:26.001 --> 0:57:29.005]: 
  updated and it's because a podcast is

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:29.005 --> 0:57:43.011]: 
  something that is supposed to be regular like you know the news or like the newspaper right exactly so it can't be human though man maybe I just want to hear about your upbringing your job I'm not disagree like your opinion we have always

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:35.856 --> 0:57:36.497]: 
  So it just-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:38.151 --> 0:57:38.843]: 
  Maybe I just want to hear

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:41.914 --> 0:57:57.574]: 
  We've always strived to create something that didn't have an expiration date. That was always the goal I don't think it's a bad goal to have for our Podcast, but I will say that in terms of all podcasts. It's gonna be pertinent to what's actually

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:53.997 --> 0:57:54.942]: 
  It's gonna be

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:56.325 --> 0:58:33.029]: 
  And you're never gonna go rent entertainment tonight VHS From a few years ago Exactly and stand shit in the world right there's dinosaur bones in a work Shooting the shit just happens to be something where people talk about what's going on with themselves It fills in a couple hours because you're like what are you up to that's very true? They're very so it's it's a it's a give-and-take, but I mean if you can achieve Complete fucking like this is in a box for the rest of time and you can crack it listen to it anytime forever Like that's the perfect podcast right and I think but I think that is hard

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:00.932 --> 0:58:04.206]: 
  before from a few years ago. Exactly.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:01.455 --> 0:58:02.097]: 
  We're from the...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:07.497 --> 0:58:09.741]: 
  Yeah, at the same time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:16.457 --> 0:58:18.179]: 
  That's very true.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:16.947 --> 0:58:17.504]: 
  True, they're very...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:30.615 --> 0:58:42.495]: 
  But I think that is the animator's mentality. Well, the animator that isn't just cashing in on the Minecraft hashtag trend.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:42.495 --> 0:58:47.153]: 
  It's someone who can try to take something that even if it is like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:47.153 --> 0:58:52.992]: 
  like fucking Harry Potter. Harry Potter is like timeless. Right, no, but exactly, now, exactly, it's timeless.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:52.671 --> 0:59:08.162]: 
  Yeah, keep justifying that Harry Potter is fucking huge dude. No it is but I just feel like well We're all calm also. I did it because exactly but we were talking about that before and you mean I did it because I love Harry Potter right but we

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:52.806 --> 0:58:55.506]: 
  Yeah, keep justifying that. It is. It is. But it is.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:54.443 --> 0:58:55.523]: 
 し

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:59.607 --> 0:59:03.285]: 
  Also, I did it because exactly but we're talking

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:00.501 --> 0:59:01.007]: 
  Also

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:04.365 --> 0:59:04.939]: 
  Are you in?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:07.335 --> 0:59:13.950]: 
  Right, but we were talking about if you were to take, what's a good parody? It's where you can take a joke.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:13.950 --> 0:59:58.585]: 
  From any series yeah, the idea is that if you make a parody cartoon You should be able to take the main characters out and plug other characters in and the jokes still works, right? So that is a timeless Mentality that is the mentality and if you understand the characters then the joke it hits you harder Yeah, because you get the killer's joke is like if C viper is riding on guile It doesn't matter because it could be sound wave on top of Megatron. Yes. It's still a funny joke It could be Jesse on top of James and it would still work. There you go. That's my favorite right But that that's like a podcast that it doesn't matter and then me I was like what's going on here But yeah, exactly. Oh

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:28.463 --> 0:59:28.919]: 
  And if you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:34.065 --> 0:59:34.926]: 
  Sure, sure, sure.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:41.946 --> 0:59:42.705]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:43.229 --> 0:59:43.634]: 
  any jokes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:47.397 --> 0:59:47.903]: 
  There you go.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:52.442 --> 0:59:53.843]: 
  matter and then me all things like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:55.986 --> 0:59:56.054]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:56.054 --> 0:59:57.454]: 
  But James is exactly what it is.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:57.606 --> 0:59:57.623]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:58.585 --> 1:00:07.444]: 
  But that's exactly what that is, is where it doesn't matter what the time frame is, it doesn't matter what the quote unquote context is.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:07.444 --> 1:00:27.104]: 
  will survive until we hit the cartoonless future where we're watching Oculus these are cartoons that or just listening Yeah, listening to There'll be a converter

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:12.169 --> 1:00:12.439]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:12.439 --> 1:00:17.282]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:24.505 --> 1:00:29.415]: 
  Put in a scapegoater and have that in your oculopsy. Oh, sure, sure, sure. We'll find a way.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:28.521 --> 1:01:10.439]: 
  Don't find a way you know the bottom line is you just don't want to alienate or isolate people with inside jokes and stuff like that because Let's move on to another topic man The last thing I was gonna say is like if like shows like Howard Stern and opiate Anthony can do talk radio and have Opinion who opiate Anthony? It's another yes. Anyway. Yeah, talk radio Howard Yeah, exactly. Yeah, if that shit can fly and people do sorry Optimists go on yeah, like if that shit works for people and they can go back and listen to that It's like ultimately it can work even if it's timed if it's dated, but it's optimal to aim for it Does work even if you fail just to achieve that goal There are gonna be fans that do want to revisit a ton of

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:46.594 --> 1:00:47.708]: 
  And the camera, anyway.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:54.509 --> 1:00:55.150]:

Hey, we're gonna have like, shows and rides and attractions. And we talked about that, like that's cool. How about they have a general fighting pit where there's animals and children bet on whether their animals gonna win. And that came into a hilarious conversation where you just duct tape a hose to a turtle and you say, go! Or you're fighting an onyx and it's just a fucking pile of rocks. And one of our animators animated that moment into like a really funny little cartoon of that. Someone will go back and listen to that. They'll take the best bits of our conversations that are completely out of context and time doesn't matter and they'll do an animation based on that or something and that's what people wanna re-listen to.

  Just fair.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:40.298 --> 1:02:48.449]: 
  That's fair. So making a wish, have you guys ever seen that video where a guy is like a vet on TV and people call him to ask him about their animals, but he has a table full of everyone's

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:48.449 --> 1:02:53.950]: 
  every kind of animal, all in the same box, and all the animals are killing each other. No, at least that's what. What?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:52.701 --> 1:03:08.496]: 
  Well, he's actually- What? Yeah, it's the funniest shit. There's like ferrets falling off the table and smacking their heads off the floor. It doesn't sound funny. It's pretty funny. And then a monkey picks up a bird, starts biting his head. He's like, no, no, no, stop. And then a dog- It doesn't sound funny. And then the dogs start slicking a turtle. And the turtle bites the dog's tongue, and starts screaming. That's pretty funny.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:57.561 --> 1:02:59.417]: 
  It doesn't sound funny. It's pretty funny.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:02.573 --> 1:03:04.497]: 
  It doesn't sound funny.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:08.057 --> 1:03:13.491]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:13.491 --> 1:03:15.499]: 
  This is on TV. This is funny.

  That shit creeps me out man. Dude, my mind is fucking blown. The only time I watch cable is at bars and at cons. And it's only because I'm bored at cons and I'm drinking at bars. It always blows my mind. This morning I'm watching Married with Children. I already don't really like that fucking show, but every two minutes another fucking commercial comes on. It's fucking mind-blowing. We got the back-to-back last week. It's a constant reminder of why I don't have cable. We got the fucking back-to-back of like, do you have acne? Put this Bane mask on and just wear it for a while. It'll clear your shit up.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:51.389 --> 1:08:05.952]: 
  One of the commercials that actually really genuinely upset me was that there was a commercial about women who did not feel sexually. I was just about to say that. That commercial blows my mind where they're like, oh, you don't feel sexually like

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:58.847 --> 1:08:01.446]: 
  I was just about to say that.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:05.952 --> 1:08:56.999]: 
  like sexy or whatever the fuck it was. After a certain age. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, after a certain age. Is your vagina dry? Call now. Don't cry. They had a thing for that. That blows my mind. They're trying to take every little thing. Do you look at a cheeseburger and you want to eat it, but you don't because maybe you had one like an hour ago. Call this number because you're suffering from cheeseburgeritis. And it's like, dude, they're just trying to take every little thing that any person is ever of mind of. Thought of having them fly. Even that. And then just make that a symptom. And you need to be cured of. Yeah. And it's not a 30 second. It's a minute long dedicated home loan. And they got a clinic for that shit. And the whole thing is just padded with women like mid 50 to 60 staring longingly at the camera. Get this vagina wet. And they're like, I don't fucking know.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:08.736 --> 1:08:10.373]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, after a certain age.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:11.942 --> 1:08:13.461]: 
  repetitions

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:36.259 --> 1:08:36.951]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:44.157 --> 1:08:46.334]: 
  dedicated and they got a

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:56.999 --> 1:08:58.939]: 
  You know what you want me to order? What do I call my...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:58.720 --> 1:11:44.669]: 
  Oh now? Now? Maybe? I don't... first hundred people? Like fuck! Dude, it's like confusing and depressing because I only watch TV like once every two years and you want to get back in touch with humankind? Watch TV only once every year or so and every time you watch it again, it'll blow your fucking mind because it advances so hard. I can give you a suite of commercials that will give you really high highs, really low lows and some creamy middles. Is that if you watch... If you watch Cartoon Network, you will see people getting hype again for slip and slides. Like the brand is slip and slides and you see kids never been more happy in their life. Then they'll have a thing saying, hey kids, download this on your phone, this new game app. The slip and slide on my phone? No, no, just like a separate commercial then after that. After that little nostalgia blast of like, yeah, slip and slides is sure, I saw my nipples off because I used it too much. But it was still fun and then they'll go, hey kids, ask your parents if it's okay to download this app. We have this game. Are you hurt? You don't know? Call this number for this app and then it'll go to like, hey, SpongeBob is coming on in five minutes. That's the creamy middle. It'll go from like, or you'll see a commercial for Splatoon, which is the most 90s kid commercial ever. You're like, that's fun, that's cool. And then you'll get to like a shitty mobile download of the thing, give us money commercial. What weirded me out and made me like a man, I'm fucking out of the loop was I saw a commercial for movie trailers and how it's like they'll show the movie and then they'll have the letter boxes with the hashtag for the movie name and then the logo for the movie on top. And I'm like, when did they start doing that? And it's like, you have to know what you're watching. Never forget the name of this movie. It's kind of genius. But I'm just, I'm like, when did that start? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The non-genius, like the idiot non-genius idiot part of it is the fact that they're throwing a hashtag on it. And who the fuck besides the idiots are hashtag like the new Superman comes out. Who the fuck is throwing a hashtag? The majority of the viewers. Wow, idiots. Idiots is the majority of the fucking viewers. Like you remember hashtag, Mick. I hashtag all the time, but all my hashtags are like fucking ironic. Yeah. Hashtag only suck stampers dick. Like, hey, did you guys see the weather? That was trending recently. Yeah. Who watches a movie trailer goes, I'm excited. After the trailer, I'm gonna hashtag this trailer. Kids, little kids. That's who. Maybe you're right. Cause I don't know. Like, you know, I like, I know he doesn't, I know he doesn't. What is the benefit for a random hashtag? Something. Is it popularity? Like they hope currently trending. Wait, hold on Chris. I don't remember what.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:19.510 --> 1:09:19.948]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:41.211 --> 1:09:44.029]: 
  Download the slip and slide app.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:00.246 --> 1:10:03.267]: 
  Call this number for this step and venue.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:41.944 --> 1:10:43.446]: 
  name of this movie.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:44.442 --> 1:10:44.999]: 
  You're like, but I'm just...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:47.580 --> 1:10:48.525]: 
  with non-genealism.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:01.587 --> 1:11:01.857]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:04.017 --> 1:11:07.122]: 
  Idiots, idiots is the majority of the fucking viewers.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:10.817 --> 1:11:12.032]: 
  Fuckin' ironic, like...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:15.829 --> 1:11:15.947]: 
  Hey!

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:17.044 --> 1:11:18.495]: 
  That was trending recently.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:22.866 --> 1:11:23.372]: 
  I'm gonna have to

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:24.824 --> 1:11:25.380]: 
  Taylor!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:31.810 --> 1:11:35.944]: 
  What is the benefit? You geriatric fucks, you just out of the loop.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:35.944 --> 1:11:37.041]: 
  No, what's the benefit of...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:38.222 --> 1:11:43.605]: 
  Do you know our hashtag? Something. Is it popularity? Do you know our member? Like they hope currently trending. Wait, hold on, Chris.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:44.635 --> 1:11:50.507]: 
  Do you not remember being a fucking 12 year old and seeing SpongeBob.com? You're like, what's SpongeBob.com?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:47.318 --> 1:11:48.634]: 
  Of course I do!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:50.507 --> 1:11:59.451]: 
  you're like oh shit they got games you play shitty fucking horrible games so Chris, how are you? Are you very right? I don't think that is the demographic but if it was I could not fight

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:53.444 --> 1:11:55.587]: 
  So Chris, how you doing? Very good. Right.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:59.451 --> 1:12:02.910]: 
  you on that 12 year old boys 60 year old girl

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:02.877 --> 1:12:50.785]: 
  Is there more mature? No, six-year-old girls are always like, HIT-A! Ha ha ha! There's no such thing as an R-rated movie anymore, so that makes perfect sense. That's true too. Yeah. It's fucking weird. The other thing I think when I put hashtags on a movie is because when that transition, a lot of movies look the same. Sure. And you need to constantly remind them, this is Transformers 7. Right. Not four and three quarters or whatever the fuck. Dude, those hashtags are dead! Every time I hear hashtags, I think it hash browns and makes me laugh. Yeah, no, I wish! I wish. But the other thing is... Dude, let's go get some hashtags, man! Right now. The other thing is that half the commercials sometimes won't even be an ad for the movie. It'll be like a little skit that they set up for it. Like, oh, I'm like, honey, why are you acting like a terminator in your underwear?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:32.138 --> 1:12:34.450]: 
  Yeah, no, I wish.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:34.450 --> 1:12:34.635]: 
  And

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:35.395 --> 1:12:36.002]: 
  Wish.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:36.002 --> 1:12:39.462]: 
  But the other thing is- Dude, let's go get some hashtags, man!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:50.785 --> 1:12:54.936]: 
  You know? Or like fucking just talking to the...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:54.936 --> 1:14:02.436]: 
  Rock doing the most awkward interview for Senatrace and shit. Yeah Where's the movies? Okay, that's what when they're celebrities to get pulled in to the fucking weird trendy-ass bullshit That is clearly so awkward like they hired some quote-unquote social media manager some bullshit to like get a Celebrity I'm saying a break for like six months and then cut it back on again. It'll be completely different world Yeah, let's talk about rule goberg machines. Those are cool If you can have a step in a Google Google or blue your machine, what would you want it would be the ball? That's boring.

No, I have anything you throw a ball into a domino the downer has something

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:57.720 --> 1:12:59.087]: 
  예에에에

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:08.487 --> 1:13:09.584]: 
  They hired some

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:14.089 --> 1:13:15.912]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:20.400 --> 1:13:20.772]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:24.079 --> 1:13:24.602]: 
  If you could have

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:46.067 --> 1:13:47.957]: 
  Yeah, but she has to get hit by something.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:50.995 --> 1:13:51.619]: 
  Oh, you're in like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:53.256 --> 1:13:56.462]: 
  Anything can happen. Oh yeah, that's so awesome. Yeah, I'm talking about

 SPEAKER_00 [1:14:02.436 --> 1:14:06.503]: 
  Now what's your next step of getting something that's hit and then it continues to change?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:06.385 --> 1:14:55.289]: 
  Oh, a plane takes off and then I fall out of it and then I'm jacking guys off All the way down Before I hit the ground And then I knocked another line of dominoes, now what happened? They have no parachutes, you're just jacking off as many cocks as you can Like that Star Trek movie when they do that skydive How did you get upstairs? A fucking ping pong ball and you're still playing like a dog Cause the domino tipped a little propeller on the plane Now gravity is really hard to get the jacking motion going so are you face up or face down? Face down. Okay, so you're pulling your or you're letting go and your hands dropping down and you're going back up. Yeah, okay, that's a good pump. There's a bunch of skydiving people. There's also a cameraman. Cameraman getting a little bit too. Yeah, you know what? That's always having that kind of boggle of my mind.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:13.641 --> 1:14:16.442]: 
  Just as far as the ground, and then I knocked another line.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:14:18.012 --> 1:14:18.450]: 
  They have

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:24.981 --> 1:14:27.597]: 
  and then do that skydive. How did you get upstairs?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:28.491 --> 1:14:28.508]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:14:28.508 --> 1:14:31.647]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:48.944 --> 1:14:52.133]: 
  Can't remember getting a little bit too Yes

 SPEAKER_00 [1:14:55.289 --> 1:14:59.946]: 
  Not the porn shit, like everybody's fucking clear there's a camera man sitting there with a boner, but

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:59.946 --> 1:15:44.496]: 
  No, when people climb the Himalayas where they have the Sherpas that help them up and they always write books about how they climb the way. How difficult it was. No, we have all the great odds and the ice glaciers. And there's no air and we're not even... And there's a fucking Sherpa dude who had to carry him up all the way to the top. It's like nobody fucking cared about that guy. I always thought Mount Everest was a magical place where you achieve your dreams and sessions and so on and so forth. It's not. It's a fucking thing filled with corpses. They're like, we can't go and get those corpses cause we'll most likely die in the process. We'll just add to it. Anyone that goes up to Everest is like, hey, look there's Ginny from three years ago. They just left them there the whole time. In fact, they're so frozen.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:07.540 --> 1:15:07.557]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:29.123 --> 1:15:29.444]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:34.489 --> 1:15:35.856]: 
 ... og kære oversat? Min juridf Pay Allies-top

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:41.205 --> 1:15:42.083]: 
  It's very slow.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:44.496 --> 1:15:52.444]: 
  and been there so long sometimes you can use them as like a step like just to get to the next like You know what? Just like a sonic spring just a whole

 SPEAKER_03 [1:15:49.069 --> 1:17:15.385]: 
  You know what, just like a sonic spring, just a whole frozen body staircase all the way up to the top of the mountain. It's really quick, because when you're at the top, you can just strap some ropes on one of the bodies and just run it down. Maybe they just leave them there for like... Warning? Not warning, but like just kind of historical purposes. Oh, come on man, human beings are more than capable of going up there and pulling those bodies down. I know the air is thin, but Jesus Christ, man, give those guys some respect. Maybe they just leave them up there because that's where they wanted to die. Well, they always... there's one famous one... Or that's their natural bearing, the dying moon they love. There's a famous one where you see two bumps and it's like one is the bump where the lady fell and they couldn't go get her, and the second bump is the husband that tried to make it over to her but couldn't, and it's like you see he didn't even make it type of shit. Wait, that was from that movie. That's like a limit? No! Wow. Oh, Snowpiercer! Snowpiercer! Snowpiercer! Snowpiercer! When they saw the two mounds as you went across the mountains. Group ones, yeah! Yeah, group ones. Do you want to drop that? No, we don't even need... Snowpiercer, the movie, it's like, ah, that's a weird cool movie about dudes on a train, whatever. You go back, you read the comic, it was based on this fucking trash. Did you want to drop that? That's weird because I thought the movie was trash! And everyone thought the movie was amazing! Thank you! Okay, listen, I thought it was pretty good, not that easy. I get like a six out of ten. It's great, not great. My problem is run tomatoes.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:52.444 --> 1:15:52.950]: 
  Stephen can stop right now now. Stephen wants to become a forwarder

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:55.364 --> 1:15:56.359]: 
  All the way up to the top.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:01.742 --> 1:16:04.949]: 
  I was right dude. Maybe they just leave them there for like...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:19.782 --> 1:16:23.612]: 
  Well, they always, there's one famous one. Or that's their natural bearing. That I knew of in love.

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:43.446 --> 1:19:54.955]: 
  My favorite comment that Jeff said about Snowpiercer and didn't occur to me until later was like he was like Here's this world where like everyone's starving and yet you got Chris Evans and he's ripped

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:54.060 --> 1:20:37.007]: 
  And he's ripped like Captain Fuckin America. Clearly someone's been eating more protein than anybody else. No, he was just really lucky and he just ate more of those black cubes. The rat cubes, the rat ribs. The rat dot protein. No, but that isn't true because spoilers. It will be a little more pu- It is. He- That's why he was so, yeah. He was a piece of shit before. That's why he was so sad because he did. See me. Everybody's eat. That's a podcast. I'm not saying the movie's horrible and I'm just shitting on it. I'm just saying it's not fucking the amazing masterpiece. Everyone says it is. I think my- At least I didn't see it there. The most disappointing scene that I thought was supposed to be in some way improved.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:08.016 --> 1:20:08.995]: 
  cubes.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:16.994 --> 1:20:17.078]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:19.019 --> 1:20:21.415]: 
  That's why he was so sad because he did.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:24.149 --> 1:20:24.165]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:24.165 --> 1:20:25.718]: 
  I'm a, I'm a, I'm a

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:30.983 --> 1:20:32.451]: 
  I think I didn't see it.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:32.451 --> 1:20:33.818]: 
  The most disappointing

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:37.007 --> 1:20:42.492]: 
  or at least interesting was the classroom train and then for me the most yeah that's cool

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:40.602 --> 1:20:43.994]: 
  And then for me the most

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:43.994 --> 1:20:57.494]: 
  played scene that I really fucking enjoyed lasted 10 seconds and it was the assassin dude who was like way far down on the train who's trying to shoot through the glass while they were on the turd.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:53.815 --> 1:21:18.115]: 
  The glass. To do while they were on the turn. That was one of the shortest scenes, but to me that was easily one of the coolest fucking scenes, that whole fucking thing. Because it's using the idea of the train in a different way, everyone just has a fight inside the one car. That's exactly what it was. This wouldn't have occurred if this was not on a train. And I feel like all the other scenes push the game.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:54.726 --> 1:20:54.878]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:55.941 --> 1:20:56.430]: 
  They were on the

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:57.494 --> 1:20:57.679]: 
  as well.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:01.425 --> 1:21:03.012]: 
  That whole fucking thing

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:09.829 --> 1:21:12.141]: 
  Right, that's exactly what it was.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:15.330 --> 1:21:16.731]: 
  And I feel like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:18.115 --> 1:21:24.443]: 
  it so hard like thematically like oh this is the the rain rain yeah exactly crazy

 SPEAKER_03 [1:21:20.832 --> 1:21:38.078]: 
  The Ravel train. The Ravel car. Yeah, exactly. This is the crazy rain strain. The sex train. Yeah, we all touch each other and do drugs. Whatever, this is the classroom one. This one was clearly like, dude, it doesn't matter what train you're in. This dude's gonna fucking kill you from a distance and it was based on the idea that

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:24.443 --> 1:21:26.974]: 
  rain yeah we all touch each other

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:38.078 --> 1:21:41.318]: 
  they were on a train. In that part I fucking did like.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:21:41.250 --> 1:21:51.207]: 
  It's really good if they look up and they see like a TV monitor and the train is like, are you on a train? They work? You don't know? They're like, there might be more trains.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:45.486 --> 1:21:48.625]: 
  You heard? You don't know!

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:51.207 --> 1:21:57.450]: 
  Art Bear from the end was like there was like a polar bear fucking another polar bear or something and there was like and then the kids like clapped

 SPEAKER_03 [1:21:55.814 --> 1:22:01.804]: 
  And then the kids like clap or something. But everyone's dead. Everyone's fucking dead. I have a question.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:57.450 --> 1:22:01.382]: 
  or something. But everyone's dead. Everyone's fucking dead. I have a question.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:22:01.382 --> 1:22:02.496]: 
  Yeah, you have a question?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:22:02.496 --> 1:22:23.995]: 
  That's a snow pearser. Oh no. You know, I thought you've not seen it really? I've never heard of it until now. I think I felt victim again to that. It's, it's... I'm gonna make you watch it. That's like another one of those movies where you need to watch it by yourself. Yeah. Without somebody hyping it up ahead of time. Yes, the hype is what kills you. Like, you know what? Never listen to anybody's opinion about any movie ever again. Just watch movies.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:22:11.895 --> 1:22:11.997]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:11.997 --> 1:22:12.452]: 
  And that's like an

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:13.127 --> 1:22:13.448]: 
  I was wrong.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:22:18.460 --> 1:22:19.793]: 
  I hate people with pills. Like, you know what, no.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:22:22.409 --> 1:22:26.897]: 
  again just watch the movie. I don't watch trailers or anything anymore. It's rude stuff.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:22:26.610 --> 1:22:32.044]: 
  You do to a point where it's annoying because I'm always like dude you should see at least the trailer and you're like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:22:32.044 --> 1:22:34.778]: 
  watch for your I like going in blind yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [1:22:34.727 --> 1:23:23.159]: 
  You're just going blind. Nobody's opinions and just make up your own has been a couple of these were I literally just heard this was good Yeah, and I never watched anything and you almost always come away not not not disappointed no expectations I didn't I didn't see you watch it's great That's what the trailer for like Mad Max Fury Road the first one had no dialogue and music beats and action and that was it sure and there was The American remake of girl with the dragon tattoo was like yeah With just music and no dialogue and no nothing did not tell you the story And I would have loved it if they always stayed with that and then the whatever movie companies said no you have They just give you a taste like an appetite Tone

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:38.170 --> 1:22:39.722]: 
  There's been a couple of movies where I

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:49.172 --> 1:22:52.159]: 
  No expectations, it's whole turkey. I watched. It's great.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:51.653 --> 1:22:51.670]:

  Derek's holes. Yeah, what I heard the guy who's making dark souls making bloodborne. I refuse to look at a single image

 SPEAKER_03 [1:23:28.508 --> 1:23:34.448]: 
  That's all the way up until I played it. I didn't see, I didn't know. That is the right way to do it. I was so happy.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:34.448 --> 1:23:47.948]: 
  This is like an adventure going on. Now I'm really fucking curious how Dark Souls 3 is going to turn out. Yeah, I'm not looking at a fucking thing. Because now that they've gone to the more kind of reaction parry based, I have no idea how they're going to make Dark Souls 3 make sense. Oh man, I'm just...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:38.059 --> 1:23:39.865]: 
  Yeah, I'm not looking at a movie.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:23:46.362 --> 1:23:50.209]: 
  I'm I don't want to know a thing about have you guys ever seen a

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:49.500 --> 1:23:53.939]:

  Yeah, okay, okay. I'll just leave it at that. All right. I'm glad you did

 SPEAKER_03 [1:23:58.950 --> 1:24:10.949]: 
  I only saw the first test though. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. The first one, and the second one just blew that. That's Evil Dead versus Orange Darkness.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:01.988 --> 1:24:02.325]: 
  Uh...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:02.663 --> 1:24:04.941]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, I see.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:04.941 --> 1:24:05.937]: 
  The first one.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:24:06.004 --> 1:24:07.017]: 
  Hey!

 SPEAKER_00 [1:24:10.949 --> 1:24:13.193]: 
  Oh wow. Yeah, no, it really is.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:12.197 --> 1:24:15.387]: 
  Yeah, no, it really is, to me. You've said it all the time.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:24:13.834 --> 1:24:18.441]: 
  me you will set all the other after this big gooch was that yeah you big Chinese

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:18.441 --> 1:24:21.344]: 
  Shit, I'm gonna fuck your butt

 SPEAKER_00 [1:24:20.027 --> 1:24:29.764]: 
  What'd you say? You said Evil Dead vs. Army of Darkness. They are the same thing. No, they're not the same thing. What do you mean? Evil Dead vs. Army of Darkness?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:23.335 --> 1:24:23.436]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:23.436 --> 1:24:24.246]: 
  They are the same thing.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:29.494 --> 1:24:32.768]: 
  Oh my god, Chris, man, it's so obvious what he means. What do you mean?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:24:32.768 --> 1:24:40.362]: 
  One is like the fucking prototype and then one is the epic like we actually kind of made the ever touch.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:38.978 --> 1:24:41.847]: 
  I always thought it was called Evil Dad, Army of Darkness.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:24:41.847 --> 1:24:47.871]: 
  Yes, but there is the original Neville. The Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2. I've never watched Evil Dead 2 in an army of a...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:44.024 --> 1:24:44.952]: 
  The evil dead is

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:44.952 --> 1:24:47.584]: 
  will lead to their listened to the two

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:46.437 --> 1:24:52.765]: 
  I've only ever seen either of that two and three because I heard the first one wasn't as good as the second one was the biggest one.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:24:50.301 --> 1:24:57.979]: 
  So, sexual is a really good game. Basically what my analogy is, is that No, it's okay.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:54.857 --> 1:25:47.187]: 
  Sorry, I fucked up. No, it's okay. But I was saying that like... Hey, did you watch the reboot? Oh yeah, we saw it on the couch. Remember that night, Chris? The Evil Dead movie? Oh, that sucks. That was great, right? Oh, but Sam Raimi was a producer on that, wasn't he? So was Campbell. He was a producer on the Razzle Dream. Oh, was he producing in that movie? Blowing guys? Yeah. There's no way he had a thing to do with that. He did. His name is in that shit. That movie is awesome if it was called Blood Cabin. Right, right? Something completely, absolutely unrelated. When I watched that movie, it was garbage. It starts off as like, Daddy, what's going on? It's like, baby, I'm sorry. It's like, no fucking talks like that. No, no one talks like that, but no one talked like anyone talked in Evil Dead 1 or 2. I think so, but it's funny. It's funny. This movie is not, it's nothing. Yeah, it's what I would call joyless. Yeah, it was joyless. That's perfect.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:57.979 --> 1:24:58.705]: 
  That's the rebook.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:25:00.983 --> 1:25:03.582]: 
  What was that? The evil dead? Oh, it sucks.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:25:04.949 --> 1:25:07.193]: 
  That was a great night, right?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:25:10.011 --> 1:25:12.272]: 
  Always keep producing in that movie blowing, guys.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:25:14.787 --> 1:25:15.006]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:25:15.006 --> 1:25:16.677]: 
  O nome dele é...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:20.406 --> 1:25:23.275]: 
  So be completely absolutely unrelated.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:39.154 --> 1:25:42.124]: 
  This movie's not finished.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:44.250 --> 1:25:46.647]: 
  It was joyless. That is perfect.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:25:48.132 --> 1:25:48.942]: 
  I was gonna say.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:25:48.942 --> 1:26:34.774]: 
  There's no levy, there's no peace. Man of Steel is joyless. Yeah, no joy. Oh no. And the fact that I saw- That's why people didn't like it, because it was joyless! Dude, literally had a no-literally- And that bothered me. When I saw the credits and I saw Nolan, I was like, you were part of this fucking debacle? Yeah. Superman is a character that inspires nothing but joy and hope, and then you make a movie. Hey, Papa K, the fucking pittacle of morality to America, you look like you have something to say, do you? Hey, Walt Clark, I don't know, should you have saved that bus full of children? No. Maybe not, I don't- Meanwhile, let me go die saving the dog, bye! For no real!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:48.992 --> 1:25:50.629]: 
  There's no levity

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:55.877 --> 1:25:56.991]: 
  Oh no. He has.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:00.889 --> 1:26:02.897]: 
  Dude, it had literally no names.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:26:04.534 --> 1:26:06.779]: 
  When I saw the credits and I saw Nolan, I was like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:26:34.774 --> 1:26:39.702]: 
  Yeah, no. Spoilers! That was not my good luck. Spoilers!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:26:35.955 --> 1:27:24.167]: 
  Spoilers! It's already like two years old and then you're close you know when you're watching Or when you're fucking watching Dragon Ball and you're seeing like Goku fight the bad guy and they're killing everyone because of how Insane the fight is and yeah, they're blowing up here like oh, they're just gonna wish them back with the Dragon Balls after it's fine Yeah, this is that in the Superman movie where everyone's getting murdered the entire town is getting leveled Yeah, and it's like oh, but no Superman's okay with that Yeah, he struggles to deal with their family There was like don't save the kids in the bus cry when the kids push you down Yeah, now here's an hour of exploding silos and 7-elevens parts where he like flat out could bring the fight Oh, yeah, but he doesn't know he could have thrown him up in the air We could have fought up in here in the stratosphere like Goku does

I don't want to have to know people like Bob rocks study better than you Swords in my hands, but I only kick people that's not Shut the fuck up because that's not his fault. That's cartoon regulation. I know that worse Anyway, we did a week of Ninja Turtle games and there's four of us So I asked a really nice animator like we have several that are in like my role with the accent Ninja Turtle games Ninja Turtle games, so we play any yes Ninja Turtles We play right okay Can I interrupt you there and say that down he was probably the best and all of them but continue? Yeah, you're not even wrong but Because of our personalities he likes Donatello, so of course he's Donatello and Liam is the youngest member of our So he's Raphael, so he's Michelangelo. Oh my okay and Pat He's the youngest man and Pat another guy. He's like I have anger issues. Oh fuck my childhood whatever He's Raphael so just by defaults Leonardo and I never liked me I didn't hate him But I never liked him right but I'm just kind of saddle with him and they made me Leonardo So that's why I needed to hold your hand there Who's your favorite Ninja Turtles a heavy-ass question man? You got to know the weight when you ask that Bob Michelangelo the most runner-up Donatello artist was the worst turtle. Yeah, sorry the most famous Renaissance Aridus was the worst turtle. I think we're just the most yes, okay sure We're sandbagging Venus de Milo and her turtle titties though. Yeah, I really think That showed up on the TV show believe you there was a Fox TV show Fox kids And they're like Ninja Turtles is not enough that's too old and fucking dated we need to update this shit says Paul marketing Let's get the girl turtle in there was Venus de Milo with light blue and her shell pumps are like shaped like turtle titties Yeah, because they give milk and all that it's great. Does she sleep on her front? Well, let us really accurately paint you the picture here The turtles have that front part that softer part on the shell the the four segmented parts and their belt goes in the right This girl has these these lumps these lovely turtle, you know how fucking sexist this is though Yes, you have a character named after an art piece by a male Artist not a female artist. He's right The receptacles of which breasts would work are blocked Because there's a turtle show over them making them literally the most useless I know I'm saying if you're gonna go out of your way to make a female turtle make a female artist You don't have to get like a chance to get to the nipple. Yeah, what's her name with the unibrow? Right right you make fucking Turtle name Freda. There you go, but splinter never had that book in the like she's the only person with the unibrow Jesus Christ I asked him one question. So what's your favorite turtle? Did you tell so much for somebody by the fair eternal? I don't want to get into a full-blown argument about these turtles Mick. You're very surface level then But you understand what I'm saying deeper like how the fuck would you they're all artists? It's like it doesn't Thematically even who pitched that shit who sat in a room with producers and everyone's like oh, yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:31:00.471 --> 1:31:01.500]: 
  There's the

 SPEAKER_01 [1:31:01.247 --> 1:31:02.564]: 
  There's a fifth turtle.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:31:07.103 --> 1:31:11.929]: 
  kids already I don't live and they're like with the turtles not enough

 SPEAKER_02 [1:31:23.809 --> 1:31:28.382]: 
  Because that's what turtles have. Yeah, because they give milk and all that.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:31:44.076 --> 1:31:46.979]: 
  Do you know how fucking sex this is though? Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:31:51.990 --> 1:31:53.712]: 
  Not a female artist. He's right.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:32:02.858 --> 1:32:04.427]: 
  I know I'm just saying if you don't go to the gym

 SPEAKER_00 [1:32:08.950 --> 1:32:11.447]: 
  You don't fucking care. You don't fucking care. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:32:14.789 --> 1:32:17.455]: 
  It's blowing air. Free the mong. Free it, right, right.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:32:22.568 --> 1:32:22.619]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:32:22.619 --> 1:32:23.024]: 
  Let's see.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:32:52.470 --> 1:32:53.736]: 
  The guilt...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:32:54.850 --> 1:32:56.723]: 
  or the interval.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:33:03.507 --> 1:33:03.996]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:33:03.996 --> 1:33:07.489]: 
  Tampons, no truck tampons.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:33:09.599 --> 1:33:52.579]: 
  The flying turtle man? No, the turtle's had a van that I would always assume Donatello made out of scrap and The party wagon! The party wagon! And he would make it out of scrap and an old crusted shit, crusted van that Hobos had a soup kitchen in what have you. And then in this new live action show with these turtle titties running around Donatello's straight up, I believe Michelangelo's straight up has a Hummer like a $100,000 vehicle. He just finds a Hummer. Like an H3. And broadcasts his own radio station through it. I don't know where the signal's coming from but let's just say that the show was wacky and took some liberties. That's all you need to. It's called Ninja Turtles The Next Mutation. The next mutation. The next mutation. Mutation.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:33:49.103 --> 1:33:50.335]: 
  That's the next presentation.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:33:51.769 --> 1:33:58.165]: 
  Mutation seems kind of accurate. When you think about it. It's got mutant.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:33:56.663 --> 1:35:26.944]: 
  You can't argue. The only thing that's gonna finish off the Ninja Turtles is the Nickelodeon CG Ninja Turtle Cartoon. Yeah. It's a very solid, awesome thing that actually does some steps into making some of the lesser turtles a little bit more interesting. Like Leonardo always watches a TV show that's a Star Trek type show, off-brand Star Trek, and he looks at how the Captain Kirk conducts himself. Deals with the team. And goes, I should do that. Yeah. The first time I've ever seen one go, let's actually give Leonardo something. Nah, you're still a bitch. You're still trying to say nothing. You're not even wrong, but I'm saying that's the possibility of it. But yeah, dude, you could have went with it. Who's your favorite Power Ranger? Who's your favorite? That's nothing. That's enough questions. The White Ranger, the Green Ranger, those are good choices right now. Well, you could say it's always like green up until the season where white shows up and then white, you know. Exactly. He died. Asian girl died in a car. I got a real question. I got a real question. Who's your favorite sex in the city, horse? Bitches. Are you ready? Yellow Ranger. Who's your favorite Street Fighter character? Gile. I don't just mean because of their moveset. I mean, who do you think, to you, is the best Street Fighter character? Gile. Oh, character. Most, most interesting? Yeah. Character. Not my favorite. Charlie. Not who I'm good with. That's right. That's right. Oro. Not their moveset. Oro. Oro is the character from Street Fighter III. He is a fucking one-armed man. I know what he's going to say. You think he's got one arm, right? He's this old-ass guy. He's like 130 or so years old, right? He's fucking amazing. He fights in the turn of the day.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:34:02.822 --> 1:34:03.244]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:34:27.122 --> 1:34:28.810]: 
  You're still a bitch, you're still a...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:34:32.337 --> 1:34:33.366]: 
  But yeah, dude, you could have-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:34:36.674 --> 1:34:38.159]: 
  Who's your... I know.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:34:39.846 --> 1:34:42.529]: 
  Well, you could say it's always like grim up until the season

 SPEAKER_01 [1:34:43.542 --> 1:34:44.807]: 
  Ja, exact.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:34:47.001 --> 1:34:47.912]: 
  It's a real question.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:34:49.937 --> 1:34:51.574]: 
  Bitches!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:35:07.302 --> 1:35:07.352]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:35:10.170 --> 1:35:10.744]: 
  That's right.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:35:18.642 --> 1:35:19.823]: 
  I know what he's gonna say.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:35:26.944 --> 1:35:32.496]: 
  with everybody with one arm bandaged up because if you took the second arm out it wouldn't be fair

 SPEAKER_03 [1:35:32.496 --> 1:36:04.879]: 
  He's that good to he's that good his whole thing is he's like I'm about to die I just need to find somebody that's strong enough or interesting enough that I wouldn't I want to teach and pass on Because my dick is so huge in fighting. No one can fucking challenge me He's that nasty yellow dude that looks like a ball of mashed potatoes Wait, who's the guy with the long who's the guy with the fucking face? Huh? Yeah, probably him yellow guy with the big ass nose. Yeah, it could be necrose Yeah, one of those two it could be you could be thinking of necror or oral, but yeah, there's a lot of nose Yeah, Oro's got tattered rags, but his story is great. He's fucking cool. Okay

 SPEAKER_01 [1:35:44.680 --> 1:35:44.747]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:35:47.684 --> 1:35:47.734]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:35:47.734 --> 1:35:49.827]: 
  Who's the guy with the fucking...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:35:49.439 --> 1:35:51.447]: 
  the fucking face

 SPEAKER_02 [1:35:50.502 --> 1:35:50.940]: 
  Peace.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:35:53.219 --> 1:35:53.489]: 
  smell

 SPEAKER_02 [1:35:53.489 --> 1:35:56.189]: 
  Yeah, it could be Necrose. It could be Necrose. Oh, it could be a one.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:35:59.429 --> 1:36:00.475]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:36:04.626 --> 1:36:12.945]: 
  So who do you go with you still stick with guy? Oh, yeah, why cuz his brother died in the war because I like guy Oh, yeah, yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [1:36:10.904 --> 1:37:44.070]: 
  He's got a funny haircut. Because he's got a guilty haircut. He's got a backwards American flag tattoo on his bicep. Well, you might roll his eyes at first, but there's a specific thing is that there's a character I already like. I already like his moveset. But it's the one thing that makes him the most interesting is that in Street Fighter 3, there's Alex, who's just basically a basic grappler. I'm a tough guy. But there's just one part of his story, which is so stupid, which is I need to get revenge because my mentor got beaten up by the boss of Street Fighter 3, Gil. And then he goes, I'm going to beat him up for you, man. And his master, Tom, looks a lot like Jean Reno, the actor. And then his master goes, no, it's OK. I got beaten pretty handily. And I'm going to recover. It was a fair fight. I should be fine. I'm going to beat him up. I don't care. No, don't do that. You're going to get killed. I'm out the door. It runs up. And that's where stupidity becomes an actual. It's like pseudo macho, man. Character straight. Yeah. It becomes a character. Well, I'm so stupid and bull. Right. Like you say, Zangief is a big, stupid Russian wrestler. And that's basically all he is. And that's fine. But this is where it actually became a bit of story, where it's like, I'm so stupid. It's why he shows up. It's why he shows up. Yeah, I love and hate Alex at the same time. It's just, yeah. And he was kind of trying to be pushed as the main character. I didn't quite pay attention. Oh, he's fun. He's still cool. He's solid. It's because he's a motion charge character grappler, all that shit, all at the same time. But that's too technical, whatever. Frame data, frame data. Yeah, boxes. Little boxes going around. I mean, I'll back.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:36:12.945 --> 1:36:12.962]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_02 [1:36:16.439 --> 1:36:16.709]: 
  Man.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:36:56.702 --> 1:36:57.479]: 
  It was a fair match.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:37:05.039 --> 1:37:05.460]: 
  1

 SPEAKER_02 [1:37:07.637 --> 1:37:08.447]: 
  This is like the actual

 SPEAKER_00 [1:37:09.257 --> 1:37:11.130]: 
  I'm Rotor Bader. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:37:11.130 --> 1:37:11.721]: 
  It comes again.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:37:23.652 --> 1:37:24.006]: 
  That's why.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:37:24.006 --> 1:37:26.352]: 
  He shows up

 SPEAKER_00 [1:37:34.637 --> 1:37:35.987]: 
  Oh, cool, he's solid.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:37:40.932 --> 1:37:41.404]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:37:42.012 --> 1:37:42.450]: 
  아 이거 너무 wishing

 SPEAKER_00 [1:37:43.345 --> 1:37:47.209]: 
  I mean, I'm not really a big street fighter fact, because I'm shitty at those games.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:37:47.125 --> 1:37:49.504]: 
  But just on observation of the characters.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:37:48.914 --> 1:37:55.005]: 
  I like the intro where it shows that guy Cody breaking out of prison just because he can't so he can't fight people.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:37:54.381 --> 1:37:55.461]: 
  I like this

 SPEAKER_03 [1:37:54.955 --> 1:38:15.306]: 
  I like this guy, I like him. Cody was my favorite character for a long time. He's bored. You're fucking boring here. I love his, yeah, he just smashes like a cross. But it's a lot like with Oro too. I mean, he's fucking, do you ever see? He also wanders back into the prison when he's gone. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you guys sit there. Have you ever seen Kung Fu Hustle? Yeah. So like that one.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:37:59.967 --> 1:38:00.945]: 
  Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:38:00.945 --> 1:38:02.987]: 
  I love his yeah, he's a smash

 SPEAKER_00 [1:38:05.704 --> 1:38:06.447]: 
  See you also

 SPEAKER_00 [1:38:08.995 --> 1:38:10.969]: 
  Yeah, yeah, you guys sit there.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:38:13.889 --> 1:38:16.994]: 
  Yeah, so like that one with the old guy at the end, the beast.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:38:16.994 --> 1:38:54.051]: 
  Yeah, yeah, that was always perfect like he just wanted to like fight somebody he's got a great time We're like he has handcuffs on and he pulled he opens the handcuff like flexes his wrist like and then puts it back on yeah Like that it's great The we had a panel earlier this week It'd be cool it like if we had known like it would be interesting for you guys to have seen it because what we did is that We took the old Street Fighter cartoon the USA cartoon that aired. Oh, man. What a piece of shit He's a shit and it was kind of the Genesis of what a charming piece of shit That's what I was gonna say is that like I love it to death You know it's terrible because it was the Genesis you knew how many times

 SPEAKER_02 [1:38:26.663 --> 1:38:28.080]: 
  That's a back on.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:38:28.080 --> 1:38:29.025]: 
 ILCY

 SPEAKER_00 [1:38:42.441 --> 1:38:42.930]: 
  Oh

 SPEAKER_00 [1:38:52.465 --> 1:38:57.426]: 
  the Genesis of the world. If you knew how many times people called me that, but yeah, anyways, go on.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:38:56.093 --> 1:39:48.625]: 
  Anyways, go on. No, that cartoon is so great, but it's like, you can't recommend it to anybody. It's like, you have to hold it close to your heart. I would actually recommend certain things, but it was kind of the justice of being why I would even put stuff on YouTube. I was like, no one has any bits of the stupid piece of relic history on YouTube yet. There's the intro on, of course, retrojunk.com. Check them out today. But no one had anything else, and I put it on there, and we did a thing where I'm like, you know what? Let's have as a secondary panel event. We're gonna commentate over this episode. And one of them was an episode based on Final Fight, and Cody was in it, and the interpretation of Cody in this version was quite different, where he's just this hot-headed redneck who loves to do nothing without any plan. He's like, and he's always out of breath, and he does this voice that's so amazing. Like, he's always gone up 16 flight of stairs, no matter what he's doing.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:39:01.999 --> 1:39:02.590]: 
  I would actually.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:39:48.439 --> 1:39:49.941]:

Yes. Yes You know that yeah, this I made this all came from this show It was that dude just trying to use Indy go go to get his house back or something No, he most definitely his daughter was like the voice actor.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:43:34.497 --> 1:46:23.483]: 
  God he had chains wrapped around his whole body and he escaped and it was him biting down on a chain as his portrait. I remember that! Who's in the jungle? And that was that character. Oh my god. If you search a little hard you can find like scans of these drawings like just on the air somewhere. That would have been my new favorite. I'm sorry that would have made him like even better. Like the fact that you got this character it's like Jango and chains like the black and chains. Yeah, but he's in the jungle. Yeah! Kicking ass. Electrocute people. That was the same pass though of sketches where Dalsim was just an elephant headed six armed fucking. That's cool. And that's the fighter you'd use was just fucking Shiva. Those concept sketches are crazy. It's insane. There's one that's never seen the light of day that was the character DJ, right? Yeah. Originally. I love DJ. The original design. Yeah, dude. The artists just said like basically the Americans that changed DJ to what he is today they got the original concept and saw some crazy Mr. Popo shit and we're just like this is so racist we can't let anyone know about this here's this alternate character. There is no image of this concept. In the original version there's no one. Just the Phantom controversy. It was deemed too racist for Earth. Wow. Yeah, Japan not knowing, not understanding. One of the bits I liked about DJ was back in his old sprite work it had maximum up his leg. Yeah. And it flips. It's absolutely genius so no matter if it goes from the first person to the second person side it still says maximum. Those letters are all reversible both ways. That's the best. That's such a smart thing. Also back to Blanca. He's the very first Street Fighter character I ever saw at a Pizza Hut when they had arcade cabinets and Pizza Hut's. He was the very first Street Fighter character I ever saw. I walked by the cabinet and I saw Blanca biting the shit out of Chum Lee's head. On the box art. On the art. Not the art but the screen. The looping. Yeah, yeah. And that was the very first time I saw Street Fighter. For a second I thought you were going to say I first saw Blanca when I walked into a pizza place. Pizza Hut. He was hanging out there. Had a fucking pizza hut. And he gave me a slice of pizza. I fucking love Blanca. That's it. The end. He put his finger around and shocked my pee pee. And he was like pzow. In the Street Fighter cartoon I mentioned before Blanca has played super serious as like a tragic shankspearing character. Like Beast? Yes. And he's voiced by like the same voice as Dino Bot from Beast Wars. Like identical. So they're basically making.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:43:47.963 --> 1:43:50.190]: 
  character. Oh my god.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:43:54.477 --> 1:43:56.957]: 
  I've been my new favorite. I'm sorry.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:43:59.404 --> 1:43:59.995]: 
  better

 SPEAKER_02 [1:43:59.995 --> 1:44:00.906]: 
  We're like...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:44:16.566 --> 1:44:19.587]: 
  This makes arms fucking cool

 SPEAKER_01 [1:44:23.097 --> 1:44:24.261]: 
  Yeah, those concepts.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:44:33.779 --> 1:44:36.833]: 
  I still love his music, yes. The original design.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:44:52.982 --> 1:44:54.265]: 
  No image.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:45:00.880 --> 1:45:00.947]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:45:14.633 --> 1:45:15.780]: 
  and it flips.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:45:25.416 --> 1:45:26.361]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:45:40.215 --> 1:45:41.279]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:45:44.907 --> 1:45:47.708]: 
  The screen figure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, more.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:45:49.632 --> 1:45:50.172]: 
  Bye for now.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:45:54.205 --> 1:45:56.567]: 
  Merry Christmas!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:45:57.377 --> 1:45:57.951]: 
  What the fuck is that?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:46:03.638 --> 1:46:04.499]: 
  I fucking hate you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:46:04.499 --> 1:46:06.389]: 
  That's it, the end.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:46:15.788 --> 1:46:18.235]: 
  like beast yes much like these boys

 SPEAKER_00 [1:46:21.660 --> 1:46:26.284]: 
  identical so they're basically making him beast of the X-Men like he's like

 SPEAKER_03 [1:46:25.845 --> 1:46:55.950]: 
  He's like, I'm a beast on the outside, but inside I read books. You literally just quoted an episode. Oh, there you go. Let me meditate. Let me meditate on this. But you guys actually, you'd have a deeper relationship if you watched this cartoon, because you'd realize that Blanka is actually Giles' dead best friend, Charlie, who gets turned into Blanka, so you, you know, those two characters. So what happens when Charlie fights Blanka? They have, well, they're both, well, Charlie's not in, like Charlie is Blanka in the cartoon. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:46:29.288 --> 1:46:29.389]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:46:29.389 --> 1:46:29.828]: 
  and literally

 SPEAKER_02 [1:46:31.397 --> 1:46:35.464]: 
  Let me meditate on this.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:46:35.464 --> 1:46:35.565]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:46:48.475 --> 1:46:50.550]: 
  So what happens with Charlie Fights blank?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:46:55.950 --> 1:46:58.499]: 
  But in the game if you have

 SPEAKER_03 [1:46:58.499 --> 1:47:14.766]: 
  Charlie versus Blanket. I don't think the Japan took this. In the game you could have Ryu versus Ryu it doesn't really fucking matter all that much. Damn it. Okay hold on does anyone know what this phrase is from? Dama desu!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:47:02.363 --> 1:47:03.730]: 
  In the game you could have a new

 SPEAKER_02 [1:47:08.472 --> 1:47:10.851]: 
  You're so mean. You're so mean. Okay, hold on.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:47:13.230 --> 1:47:13.551]: 
  Dumbass.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:47:13.551 --> 1:47:15.053]: 
  What is it?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:47:14.766 --> 1:47:19.238]: 
  Probably not. No, it's from the original one.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:47:18.664 --> 1:47:30.004]: 
  family game so force got the first soul rug that soul so late so late so blade the first one yeah it was it was one of the guys and his friend

 SPEAKER_00 [1:47:27.507 --> 1:47:27.524]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:47:30.004 --> 1:47:39.437]: 
  was in his Japanese phrase I have no idea what it means but he was like dama eisei it just sounds like damn easy when I played it that's so blade for

 SPEAKER_03 [1:47:39.437 --> 1:47:47.942]: 
  PS1 it was the first soul game that they ever had soul edge. Yeah, it's soul edge and soul blade Yeah, yeah, they're called the two different things to pay. I think it was a non-chunk

 SPEAKER_01 [1:47:43.504 --> 1:47:44.230]: 
  Yeah, it's so legit.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:47:44.230 --> 1:47:45.360]: 
  Sow blade yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [1:47:46.879 --> 1:47:49.765]: 
  I think it was the nunchuck guy in the first one.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:47:49.765 --> 1:47:52.262]: 
  No one quotes sole. Everyone quotes sole.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:47:50.744 --> 1:48:00.582]: 
  Everyone calls Soul Calibur. I'm sorry, Dama Eze was easily one of the first things that I listen to again and again and again because that was just...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:48:00.514 --> 1:48:27.430]: 
  That cadence, okay? I'm old, okay? I get it, I get it. The game came out in the 90s, not old. 98 or something. That is one of the best intros for a video game ever made. Agreed. It was great. Ever. Ever. You know what? The whole Soul Series was really good with their intros. I really appreciated their intros. I got more enjoyment out of watching the intro on loop than I did playing the fucking game after them. I will say that the Soul Series always made Brock seem like he was just so much better than he ever was.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:48:02.370 --> 1:48:02.455]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:48:03.653 --> 1:48:04.716]:

  It was great.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:48:13.137 --> 1:48:13.980]: 
  You know what I'm saying?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:48:17.372 --> 1:48:18.267]: 
  I got more

 SPEAKER_02 [1:48:22.013 --> 1:48:23.414]:

Uh, Robbie? Yeah, he voiced rock in Soulblade as well. What?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:48:37.504 --> 1:48:42.938]:

  Two different....

 SPEAKER_00 [1:53:34.589 --> 1:53:39.719]: 
  There was something about Mortal Kombat that bothered me that I was going to bring up because I was

 SPEAKER_03 [1:53:39.094 --> 1:54:51.437]: 
  Was it the fact that Sub-Zero gets beaten by a bucket of fucking water? Well, the scorpion spear came out of the palm of his hand and had a little face on it that went AHHHHHHHHH No, it did weird me out that Katana's over in the corner like Use the alien, that brings life And he's sitting there in the fight and the fight is like Oh, there's a bucket of water Water, life, it's like dude Use the bucket of water And he's like, alright, yeah, let's do it Put that fucking fume and chew accent with it to use the element Yeah, the fight was like, she's just stroking her beard She got a little sun And they're like, oh, you love the one that's supposed to be Well, she's 10,000 years old, they keep trying to harp on that Yeah, well, I mean, it was kind of a bearded kids at the time, right? I don't think so, because there was, I mean, it had violence, I mean, there was piercing through you Well, yeah, but you can't deny that at the time The target demographic was like kids I think it was older kids I think it was like, it was teenagers Not adults, but older kids Right, so I think it was older kids and then kids who weren't supposed to watch the movie Who got to watch the movie

 SPEAKER_01 [1:53:42.452 --> 1:53:42.874]: 
  Well

 SPEAKER_02 [1:53:47.565 --> 1:53:49.574]: 
  and it had a little face on it that went...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:53:55.227 --> 1:53:57.437]: 
  That brings it

 SPEAKER_01 [1:53:57.437 --> 1:53:59.445]:

  to move and be like oh my god I got to watch more to combat.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:54:53.496 --> 1:55:29.794]: 
  The most amazing thing to come out of Mortal Kombat the movie is the actor that played Kano his Australian interpretation Became oh, yeah, it's a dough way that is portrayed Kano now like imagine if in the fucking Street Fighter Van Damme movie They're like, you know what Kyle should be French yeah from now on that would be a sick thing Yeah, people should like that like that's the first movie I can remember as a kid where I saw it and it had one of those things where it ends on a note where you just start marking out Running out of the theater screaming because Shao Kahn shows up. Yeah, like I know I don't remember leaving a theater excited
