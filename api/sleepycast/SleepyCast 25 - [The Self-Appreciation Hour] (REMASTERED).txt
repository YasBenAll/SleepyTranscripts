  Speaking of behaving and speaking of Q&A's Jeff. Yes, sir Do you happen to have a question locked and loaded and ready to fire off? All the chambers are full though. Oh, right. Shoot off the first one here. Shoot it off D&D movies 42 asks Have any have any of you considered doing more serious animations something that's a drama and not funny Mick Yeah, I mean I would say for the most part I'm already doing half of that because none of my cartoons are particularly funny Dramatic ones I mean I've had them in mind. I have a lot of projects in mind But will I ever have the opportunity in this lifetime? I don't know. I mean, yes I have lots of ideas in mind, but probably because I Have a lot of like film stuff in mind, you know, like a lot of like more dramatic film me shit that I would then also translate the animation What's up? Cory Yes, I don't think

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:42.480 --> 0:02:43.864]: 
  Shoot off the first one here.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:56.369 --> 0:02:58.883]: 
  I would take this one.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:03:30.439 --> 0:03:31.620]: 
  Being in class.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:34.236 --> 0:04:11.327]: 
  I could ever do something with seriousness, not because like I just can't do it, but because it's not really in my nature. Sure. Like for me to write something serious, it would have to be like bullshit joking serious, like over the top something like in the vein of Shod where it's like light humor. Right. Insulting jokes, but serious. I could do something like that, but a real tone, it's not something I know how to write. I don't feel like I'd write the character. What was that movie with the guy with the cancer with Gordon Lovett? 50. Was that? Philadelphia. Yeah, 50-50. Did that have like a Philadelphia? That was the guy with the A. Close.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:03:51.398 --> 0:03:51.449]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:58.857 --> 0:03:59.498]: 
  was it?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:08.442 --> 0:04:09.454]: 
  That was the guy with the E.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:12.812 --> 0:04:24.389]: 
  No, it wasn't. I mean, there's a lot of jokes in that, but it was fairly serious, right? Yeah, I guess, uh, yeah. I mean, I guess you could consider that film serious. The one with Tom Haines was serious, too. Filled up here. But it was also hilarious, too.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:16.744 --> 0:04:16.913]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:25.722 --> 0:04:39.677]: 
  Oh yeah, that hilarious scene where he dies of AIDS at the laugh track plays. He's crying. My favorite scene, I thought the funniest scene was when Antonio Banderas was banging him up the butt. That was pretty cool. The boyfriend Phil Dopey? Yeah. That was Antonio. I thought it was, wasn't it?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:29.805 --> 0:04:33.113]: 
  My favorite scene, I thought the funniest scene was when Antonio...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:04:35.982 --> 0:04:35.999]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:37.332 --> 0:04:37.450]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:40.589 --> 0:06:38.055]: 
  It was a very attractive hub of sex man. I couldn't even, there is. I could be wrong, I haven't watched that movie in a long time. I've tried writing serious stuff, but it was... Dry humor always sort of seeps its way in. I just start writing dialogue and I can't... That's what I'm saying. Get away from it. I couldn't sit there and write something serious like, oh, you killed my whole family. I'm not writing spawn. I don't know how to write. Like, if I was being serious, it would have to be over the top fucking serious. You said spawn? I thought how spawn was like... Is that your go-to... Punisher. Oh, okay. I get spawn and punisher confused because I'm an idiot, but... In Corey's DVD... Is that your go-to... In his library... In his library... Serious fucking marvel. That's on your draw list. It's under the draw list. He has spawn and punisher next to fucking Shawshake Retemption. No, punisher... I'm talking about like, create like... Because punisher like, the seriousness of it as a marvel movie, it's marvel, right? Yes. So, that's something I would like... It would be cliche like that. I don't want to do something like that. It would have to be something serious like... Not done before, but everything's been kind of done before in a serious... Like, everything that you've liked that was serious. I couldn't write something like fucking... The show everybody likes, but I saw the last, the finale of... Daredevil? A fucking breaking bad, Corey. This pissed me off. Corey, never watch. What was the breaking bad? For some reason you watched the fucking last episode. I saw the first episode and the last episode. I guess you cut the bullshit right out. You got right to it, Corey. And then it was real. Okay, yeah, you still have to do it. I can do it in the play. I was drunk and I played the Direct TV game where I tried to guess the synopsis and I got it fucking right. Of the whole entire series. So, let me tell you something. Well, he cooks drugs, you mean? He's a science teacher who knows how to make good math and so all the bad guys are like, hey, stop doing it or work for us. And he's like, no, okay, we're gonna kill you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:52.722 --> 0:04:53.447]: 
  TÃ´ isso no switches.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:53.447 --> 0:04:53.464]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [0:04:53.464 --> 0:04:55.219]: 
  Yeah, get away from it

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:07.420 --> 0:05:07.960]: 
  It was like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:16.920 --> 0:05:18.777]: 
  yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:21.662 --> 0:05:25.409]: 
  That's under the draw list. It's under the draw list.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:05:51.058 --> 0:05:51.413]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:04.575 --> 0:06:05.217]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:02.481 --> 0:08:21.044]: 
  The last time I puked from drinking a lot of beer was when someone got like a huge six... not six pack, I think it was a 24 pack and I had six beer blue moons and then I went upstairs to say hi to my girlfriend and then I puked it back in front of her. It was like probably eight months ago. What about New York?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:15.998 --> 0:08:17.736]: 
  It was his. I love you, it was his.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:21.837 --> 0:08:51.199]: 
  No, that was in beer, that was liquor and shit. Oh, I see. From beer alone. Well, so that story when fucking John comes down. Yeah, we needed to tell that story. That story is an exciting story. But, to answer the question. Yeah, so Chris and Zach, what about you guys? Yeah, I could, I could, I could, I could try. Look, I've always wanted to kind of go into each genre and see how I can do it. Like, I've always wanted to see if I can do horror well, or is something serious well, or something actually well. You know, I don't know. It'd just be fun to experiment and see how each thing is and how it's... But there's...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:27.557 --> 0:08:29.279]: 
  Yeah, we need to tell it. That's a whole, that's a whole billion.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:50.963 --> 0:08:53.005]: 
  But there hasn't been a project on your mind.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:53.005 --> 0:09:09.998]: 
  Here's a question for Zach. Somebody said, hey, would you... If the History Channel said, hey Zach, we'd like you to edit a World War II documentary in your style. What would you do? What would we edit it like? If they gave you a bunch of footage and said, all right, here's... we'd like to tell you a particular

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:53.730 --> 0:08:55.502]:

  style.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:03.957 --> 0:09:06.454]: 
  What would you do? What would we edit it like? We cut it in touch with the camera.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:11.010 --> 0:10:07.609]: 
  Battle or something in world? Yeah, I think that'd be fun because I feel like a lot of people make it boring There's a lot of ways where you could like if you if you look at things the right way like the history Especially there's a lot of ways to make it because it is interesting. Yeah, people fucking I do it Just decided to topple your phenomenon pretty much Yeah, you know I tell you pretty much within like the last century people are still alive We're not around for I can already see it too like you'd have a Adolf Hitler like a slow zoom You know how they do the slow zooms and they would make it right before he cuts away You do like a funny face drawn over Just one brain I would show the human side of Hitler and show like you burnt my eggs these eggs are burnt It's fine though. I'll still eat them anyways. I don't want to be rude. I try that side of Hitler the real important stuff I chose stars. I chose stars trying to shape it Not a bad guy. You just know those annoying You'd have this like this like light music behind while you were like it off like to say so Stalin couldn't shave properly

 SPEAKER_04 [0:09:21.625 --> 0:09:22.199]:

Right, and Lee. If it was like one of that and he was like shooting his hand out, and they fucking actually recoiled and knocked his block off. You know he doesn't actually have like a rocking hand. Yes, you guys. That's a visual effect. Who explains to you? He doesn't have a real Iron Man costume. Have you ever seen cartoons with extinguishers? You put them on the bag, you snap off the fucking sprayer, and it goes flying. That's how they do it. That is actually how somebody's wife recently died. They said it was one of those gas canisters, and I think it was on the set of something. If you guys Google it, you'll find it. But it went flying, and apparently it went like all the way through the chest cavity. Oh, everybody loves Raven. Yeah, who was that? Everybody loves Raven. The wife died on that for that. Oh, was that it? Everybody loves Raven. Yeah, she died. It was horrible. It went through her fucking body. It tore a big hole in her. Yeah, she was like, oh no, she's dead. Oh, it's really bad.

Yeah, that was the brother for everybody loves Raven. It was the brother. Yeah. You know how the big brother is always the brother.

That's just your kind of person. And that to me, it's like, cause you're my friend, it's like, oh man, I wish Jeff was here, but I'm not gonna fucking go right home about it and cry myself to sleep over it. It's just something, you know, that's my own personal thing. Now, hold on, do you just mean like he doesn't want to be involved or does the thing that actually bother you when Jeff says he's gonna come over and then he just fucking doesn't even show up? Like something you like. Is that what you're talking about? I'm not complaining about it. I'm just trying to clarify. It's tater totter even. See now, it's interesting you bring that up, Corey. It's interesting. Oh no. I'm gonna lead back. I'm gonna use two, give it to the judge. Jeff, I don't mind. I don't mind. I don't care. I'm just saying, is it...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:33.889 --> 0:13:35.745]: 
  It's not something that can be fixed.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:41.550 --> 0:13:41.939]: 
  and was like, well done.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:45.634 --> 0:13:45.904]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:58.864 --> 0:14:00.282]: 
  No one. Nobody else.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:05.294 --> 0:14:06.323]: 
  those and then you just

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:07.487 --> 0:14:13.950]: 
  Like something you're talking about. I'm not complaining about it. I was just trying to put it on. It's Tater Totter even.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:14:12.060 --> 0:14:13.225]: 
  It's Tater Totter even.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:20.295 --> 0:14:20.937]: 
  Good job.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:20.937 --> 0:14:24.362]: 
  I don't mind. I don't mind. I don't mind.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:28.193 --> 0:14:40.647]: 
  Is it interesting that everywhere you go to a party, you're only there for like two hours, and you're like, I gotta get the fuck out of here. Yes! And you're like, get me out of here now. Does that annoy you though?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:35.669 --> 0:14:36.023]: 
  Oh

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:37.221 --> 0:14:37.845]: 
  and you're like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:37.845 --> 0:14:37.947]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:39.600 --> 0:14:40.124]: 
  Does that annoy you?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:41.389 --> 0:15:21.754]: 
  It doesn't annoy me, I almost feel bad that you even go in the first place because you're like, I'm sick of this, I gotta leave. It's not similar to that. I have this weird thing, I guess, when I go to a place and I meet everybody, I don't wanna stick around. I wanna say hi unless there's somebody I generally know and can talk to. But let's say for something like Pico Day, I was the first one out for everybody. And the reason is because once I say hi to everybody and I've already drank and I'm on that point where I buzzed, I don't feel like I could last much longer. Like I'll either be passed out somewhere in my room where someone would steal my shoes, or I would fucking just be so drunk.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:22.514 --> 0:18:03.569]: 
  That I would be out of control and I don't want to do that. Cory, when you're around people, do you like, does your energy get drained? Yeah. Yeah. Pretty quickly. When I'm around new people. That's like, that's introvert. Yeah, it might be. Other people are the opposite. The more people that are around, it's like they're sucking their power in like Goku. It definitely fucking drains me. It absolutely drains me. No, I'm the same way. And I'm the same way. It drained like, I was at Pico Day for six hours. I was there, I saw everybody, I missed a few, and then I was gone and I wasn't coming back. As much as people would think Zack is an introvert, I actually see, I feel like when there's a lot of people around and Zack's getting some attention, he's like a solar panel. He's like, he just absorbs it and he gets more excited. It's only because I get nervous. It's a defense, it's a defense mechanism. I'm in the same way. I always feel like when I meet people, I'm always a little bit more out there just so it's like, fuck you. Yeah. Fuck your dog. I don't care, I don't get, fuck you. I expect people to not like me when I first meet them. It's difficult. So purposely a little bit over, you know what I mean? Yeah. I'm kind of exaggerating my self-sufficiency. You don't like me? Fuck you. I don't expect you to like me. You care about a fucker. You know what I mean? It's a defense mechanism. I've built up a people not liking me for a long time. You're a jerk. I'm not a jerk, but it's like, I'm not like, hey, you know, hey, dickhead. You better be like, I don't know, I feel like I'm a little bit more energetic. So I'm also exaggerating my self-sufficiency. If you don't like this exaggerating version of me, fuck you. It's almost like I make people not like me on purpose because they expect me not to anyways. It's what I don't go to it to be a lawyer or a dick or I can't really describe it. It's hard to do. So when I was so when I was younger and I was bouncing around like from Malaysia to Taiwan and Taiwan to Japan or Taiwan to Malaysia to Japan and then back to Seattle and then to New York, I had this thing. I only knew people for like a couple of years at a time. So I kind of had to develop a system in order for me to determine who my friends were going to be in a very short amount of time. Yeah. So essentially what I would do is I go to a new place and I would just let it all fucking hang out. I would burp, fart, say whatever disgusting things I had on my mind to get stupid plaster drunk. You know, just basically be who I am, you know, after you've known me for a while, but immediately. And it actually it's funny like how quickly, you know, you get to know people and there are a lot of people who aren't used to that. Like they need to be kind of weaned into it. So like a year or two would pass and they'd be like, you know, when I first met you, you're fucking ass. You were so drunk at that party and you were just farting on people and you were just fucking humping things. That sounds like it. See, I don't think I like that. I don't know. But I, but you know what I'm saying? Like, I want to be better. I feel like that's almost the same kind of thing in a way. Yeah. It's like, fuck you. I don't expect you to like me anyways. I'm unlikable. I know you hate me. So I don't give a shit. Yeah. It's more like that. I know I'm not. I'm a fucking.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:25.585 --> 0:15:26.175]: 
  Corey.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:15:25.602 --> 0:15:25.889]:

Did I've done it in my life? Yeah. It wouldn't be that big. Yeah, but how big would it be? Do it with your own hands. I don't know, it'd probably be like... Oh, my whole life. The whole life. Everything that's gone up my nose. Yeah. The sandcastle. I know. I don't know, maybe like... One of these days... Oh, that's petite. One of these days we're gonna get to the bottom and mix some serious past. I don't have a mystery in that. I want to figure out you killed some people as you're something. I've done coke before, but I've only done it once. And that was when I was already doing Molly. So once you do Molly and then you do coke you're like, yeah, Molly's better. Yeah, but your nose is still browning this day. I'll tell you what. It's only if you're like, morning or after dead bodies. I would like Mick, Corey and Chris off each pick like two people or something. We'll move on to the next question. Is this a go on forever? I'll just go through really quick. Yeah. Corey, I like how little of a shit you give about anything negative that anyone will ever say about you. You can never say anything negative. It bounces off you like you're made of rubber and they're made of glue. Sticks and stones. Mm-hmm. A little bit different than what... Okay, Zach. Oh, that's kind of the... Zach, I am genuinely baffled by how... Autistic? Yeah. No, but no. You're ruining it. Zach, I'm amazed by how little of a... What's the word? How tiny is penis is?

Zach, what I like about you is I like how methodical you are with what you say. Like, you don't just spit shit out. You have a lot of stuff to back it up. So you're not a shit talker, you're a talker that can dish out shit. He's eloquent with his arguments. Yes, you're very, like you, you would never go up to someone and be like, hey, you wouldn't just say shit about someone. You would have shit to back it up. So I like that you're... Thank you, thank you. So you're, that's why you could write editorials because you know all this shit. And like Chris.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:02.760 --> 0:25:03.638]: 
  Yeah I think he has to say himself back to his arguments.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:18.471 --> 0:25:57.351]: 
  God damn it. Everyone's already said everything I want to say about you. But it's like Chris, I love how bro you are. You're like the best bro. I'm a bra. You're a dick, you're a dick. I can pretty much talk to you about fucking anything. So it's like I have like no worries so I can like share my secrets and shit and I have nothing to worry about. You know what one of Chris's things that he didn't like about you was? That you never shut up and you keep talking to him. Yeah, it's true. You're pissing off every day. Cory, I never want to hear your voice again. Cory, this is a joke you should actually die. No Cory, I greatly appreciate all that. I like sitting in our little tents that we make out of our bedsheets and tell secrets.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:00.186 --> 0:26:47.689]: 
  Swaps a library, tell spooky stories, talk about Kevin. Jeff, I guess it's not really with art, but I love how, again, it would be a lot like Zach, you're very committed to what you do, and you're also, like, just the amount of sheer detail you focus on stuff. It's not enough that it's just moving, you focus on the little things that people would forget, the kind of stuff that people appreciate but don't remember. I should take that on. Jeff will draw things like and stuff, you'll freeze for it, you'll be like, God damn, Jeff, you put like 10 hours of these things, what's good to see for what's second? I know, and it sucks great, cause it's like something I appreciate. There's art, you know, I'd say, you know, there's plenty of artists that are like that, like stampers like that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:01.840 --> 0:26:02.093]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:48.314 --> 0:30:36.953]: 
  Uh, the guy we met recently, Red Minus, great guy. He's like that too. Like we're super like, I'm not gonna call us all autistic or something, but we're super OCD with details. Well that's good. Whatever the S.P. Maybe almost too. I don't know if it affects us negatively when we spend too much time on things. No, because it's worth it. And I understand that because I'm a perfectionist. I do something over and over. And then when I release it, I'm like, oh, it looks bad. I gotta redo it sometime in the future. Nick. What I appreciate the most about you is how much of a community man and how you can like hold something together. Like you're the glue in any bind. Like without you, we would be fucking lost and probably like eating like shit out of the toilets. Moving on. Flambold asks, one of the most notable things about your collective comedy is how far it pushes boundaries. Yeah. I really enjoy that about your podcast and everything you guys do. Here's the question. Where do you personally draw the line? Is there something so offensive you won't make fun of it? And or is there something that offends you in comedy? Mm. What do you start this off? I'll just say this really quick. I love everything that you guys do. I don't always, it's not like I would use the word retard or the N word. That's because you're fucking retard. Yeah. And your N word. I prefer not to use some of these words or make some of these jokes myself, but I don't judge anyone who does unless I feel like it's extremely malicious. I don't feel like you guys are ever particularly malicious about it. What if it's a retarded N word being malicious? And that's what they are. If I ever do use the word retard, I use it in terms of really being pissed off at somebody. When I use that word, I literally mean, I would obviously never call someone who's handicapped a retard, but it's like if somebody is so... They're basically clawing to the left. Would you claw on the... Yeah. They, to me, are truly retarded. The people, they may not have a quote unquote mental handicap, but as far as I'm concerned, they're worse than... They are just... Would you... No, no, no. It's like they are less capable. I would rather... My brother-in-law has cerebral palsy, right? And I would much rather have a conversation with him than a lot of other people. Than a fucking return. Right. Like some guy at a bar who's sitting there screaming at the television, slapping girls' butts, high-fiving his friends, spitting his beer all over the bartender, and then looking at me going, hey, you want to fight? It's like... Well, Nick, in my defense, I was a little bit... Fuck. Shit. Also, I don't like to do rape humor unless it's like clearly light-hearted, like, you know... You know, there's no... There's no... There's no harm in a light-hearted rape, you know what I'm saying? No, no, no, no. I've just... I've just seen... Look, I don't... I just showed the tip against the rest. I'm not going to name any names. I'm not going to name any names. But like, you know, there's... She was bit some... Playfully lonely, too. There's been some rape humor that has been extremely graphic, and I feel out of... Not even remotely comical in any way. You're saying you're next D or SQUEEF. Yeah, and now when I say the word rape, I know every... Like so many... Like, 90% of the people are thinking of a man raping a woman. That's not what I'm talking about. And raping no scenario is okay. However, you know, a bowl getting raped by a tractor is kind of funny to me. I know that, you know... I think it's also where you place the joke. That too. So if you do a rape joke where the joke... You're literally saying, aha, this stupid cunt got raped. It's not really... That's not funny. It's not funny. But you make the rapist, you know... Rapist, cake, and reaction up. That's funny. You make me rape a little bit funny. What do you think is the farthest you've gone, Mick? As an example? It's like the most thing you've like, alright, it's the farthest... I think I've gone in the offensive... What do you say? Okay, that was far from me. I shouldn't have. That's a really good question. I don't think I've ever...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:48.668 --> 0:26:50.001]: 
  God we met recently.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:50.828 --> 0:26:52.397]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:29:46.885 --> 0:29:47.121]: 
  Yeah.

  that too.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:30:16.079 --> 0:30:16.197]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:30:31.536 --> 0:30:32.194]: 
  They won't want to use it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:34.067 --> 0:30:35.063]: 
  Oh my God, I can't believe it. That's a really good one.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:37.746 --> 0:31:28.304]: 
  I don't really... They don't feel like you were just writing a line, your personal line, you're like, oh that was a buzz cut. Not... I don't think I ever really do that. I guess the worst thing I possibly did was way back when I made a cartoon, it was about... it was a pacifist's fighting game, and I think I had Gandhi, and then a bunch of cops come and beat him with batons until he's dead, and then it's like, you died, you win, or whatever. I don't know, but like, I think that was about the worst. That's really really like, oh I shouldn't have done that. You know what, even then I wasn't like, I shouldn't have done it, but that was about as far as I personally pushed it, I think. That sounds like a good mobile game. Yeah, but I've been a part of plenty of projects that definitely, mostly your guys' projects, fucking some cancer boy falling on his tube. Alright, look.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:07.682 --> 0:31:08.239]: 
  That's what that's about.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:15.175 --> 0:31:15.462]: 
  That's a wrap.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:28.911 --> 0:31:51.810]: 
  Pokemon cartoon I would never live down The other the game I made with a swing called Ching chong beautiful. That's another one Well, I love that game that games largely not that bad besides the name But there are a few little details like Like one of the stages actually takes place in the crater It takes me set a crater and on the map. It's where like Nagasaki is

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:37.551 --> 0:31:38.159]: 
  Oh, I love that game.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:53.616 --> 0:32:17.393]: 
  There's a few blinds of dog on there that are really... I think Swain like said something, this had nothing to do with me. I'm like, record some shit. He had his friend record a line calling the characters in the game zipper heads. Holy fuck. If anybody wants to know why you call people zipper heads, it's when you run over their head with a tank and it leaves a tread in their head, like a zipper.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:17.393 --> 0:32:20.127]: 
  You can know that. Don't laugh, that's not funny. Before you know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:19.334 --> 0:33:04.980]: 
  You know yeah, the more you know Chris I know you like to go over this question. I mean I've made my shitty edgy view murk cartoons back in the day. Yeah, I remember your swastika neo-nazi Christmas thing That's not even that bad. It's not that bad. It's just a guy coding a swastika. Oh that got banned in Germany Did it really? Yeah, it still is I mean It's just a fucking swastika like the worst shit I've ever made was fucking slightly rapey things I don't think any humor is out of boundaries as long as it's it's clear you're not being malicious and there's good funny context to it I The one place I like to go is just big mean to people specifically like if you could you could like make fun of like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:37.491 --> 0:32:37.778]: 
  That's not it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:37.778 --> 0:32:37.913]: 
  Thank you very much.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:44.579 --> 0:32:46.958]: 
  I mean, swastika stuff is main issue.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:05.909 --> 0:34:07.131]: 
  Progeria or cancer or something, but if you're like going after when you single out somebody who is good hearted They have no reason to be in the situation there are and you call them out for it and make a joke about that Yeah, just a personal shit. They can help us like well, what do you fucking? Like I don't know Lucy K right Lucy K is like one of the Liberal fucking heroes of comedy and yet like I when he's talking about his own daughters Like yeah, my daughter's a fucking retarded cunt, you know and like everyone laughs They're not retarded though I mean like in a sense what it's like if you do something a birthday can be like oh, man, you're fucking the four Yeah, that's not funny. Oh, one of his funniest bits. I mean he was in he was on the opening Anthony show When he explains the word nigger Neil who's like the blackest black ever Chris explain that word kike problem. He's actually telling the audience Right, he's like, you know Just a feeling like he's like you just being such a nigger

  We

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:16.371 --> 0:33:16.388]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:34:07.705 --> 0:34:07.857]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:08.954 --> 0:35:04.995]: 
  But any other comedian who said like if any of them but I mean like like Patrice is actually a good example I saw a roast he was on where they're like making those diabetes. I was like, that's not that funny This is kind of that's me it's weird. It was me. Have you ever seen a good roast? No, my point is when you say something up or something fucking hate it's like go on I do too It's the same so I hard like bullshit It's what it's like what it always feels like a roast is it always feels like they're they're like um They're hoping to steal the show up on stage. Yeah, everyone is taking a shot at trying to steal the show I think you make fun of me for making a bad decision or say something like saying something do something stupid But if you make somebody like for what they want, it just like the Bob Saget like there was there was I think there are a few funny Things about Bob Saget and his past with drugs and to be fair Bob Saget. He's done a lot of awful shit Yeah, it's not not just his like drugs or his like full house like he's made some terrible shit

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:20.867 --> 0:34:21.846]: 
  man have you ever

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:25.929 --> 0:34:27.380]: 
  It's a goal you put on. I do too.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:30.081 --> 0:34:30.503]: 
  See you next time.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:32.342 --> 0:34:32.933]: 
  It's what's

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:39.312 --> 0:34:39.429]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:42.534 --> 0:34:42.636]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:55.545 --> 0:34:56.069]: 
  to be fair.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:58.296 --> 0:34:59.376]: 
  Yeah, it's true.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:05.822 --> 0:35:41.783]: 
  But I don't think anything's off limits. As long as you, look, the two most important things, I would say the most, actually, there's one important thing. There's one important thing and one kind of important thing. The most important thing is intent. If you are saying something with the intent of making somebody laugh and not say to be hurtful, and it doesn't land, like if you make a rape joke, but you're trying to listen to laughter, and they'll be laughed, I don't think, you're trying to be funny. That should be important. You're saying intent and context. Context is the second important thing, but I think intent is the biggest. If you say like, oh, you should get raped, like a rape victim.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:35:21.904 --> 0:35:22.140]: 
  Right.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:32.839 --> 0:35:34.544]: 
  You're saying intent and context.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:32.991 --> 0:35:33.379]: 
  saying in

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:42.559 --> 0:40:18.735]: 
  You're intending to hurt the view intending to elicit some kind of upset reaction. That's not trying to make anybody laugh What do you think of the amount of people out there who really can't even don't even understand the difference in that? They get mad on the other people like to be offended. Yeah, that's true There's people legitimately don't understand fish for ways to be offended and they'll use it against you The thing is too You'll see I got to fucking argue with somebody on Twitter of all places, you know, I'm sure this never happens before an argument on Twitter who knew And the person is talking about rape jokes But they also like it's always said in Philadelphia And I showed him what was popular always sunny bits was which was the characters Dennis the character back They bought a boat and they're like a third of their bike stuff for the boat and The character Dennis is talking about you know taking the woman out You know we should get back to the machine like a mattress for the boat You know because I got you you want to take one of the boat and they get on the camera views because of the application And he goes this weird thing was like, you know We love they can't one thing to say no to be a word of both of them over and it's kind of it's pretty much a rape joke Yeah, and I showed it to the guys. What do you think of that? He's okay. That's funny As I see a laughter rape joke. I think the issue is people draw their lights everywhere There's no consistent objective like lineup for what's a good rape joke. What's a bad rape joke? Even if you don't like my jokes for the left or black joke, you know My joke that's my whole joke. That's exactly what I'm talking about the Lucy Ck thing about racism jokes where people are like there are no good like it's not never Funny, so what about this? Yeah, what exactly you can never use that word to make it? There's also a very famous very very funny very famous Skit with as an else kid with Chevy Chase. Oh, yeah, and Richard prior to prior. Oh, yeah Yes, I have it's basically Chevy Chase is like a guy hiring somebody's like Let's play a word. I'll tell you a word and you give me you say what you think it first good to survive. He's a dog cat Yeah, then it gets yeah, then it's like black white tar baby. Yeah jungle buddy Yeah, he's like dead Yes, it's a funny bit, but they made that word funny They made that word they put in the context was funny. It was appropriate and the joke wasn't just to be fair and to be clear When we say funny, I think it's important to remember that I'm not saying the word itself is in front Look, well, no, I'm not saying that I think one like when I was talking about Lucy came when we're talking about this too When we're saying it's funny what I mean is it's accepted by a general populace as being funny By left, you know by very liberal minded people who are finding a lot of these jokes funny if you were to like say like Yeah, you can't make rape jokes you shouldn't be able to make jokes about anything because you know like bugs bunnies Where do you draw the line gets hit on the head with a hammer, right? Yeah There's at least like 50 people in the past whose faces have been smashed in with hammers and their families lives have been ruined But you don't see them saying like stop making videos about hammers. They're probably some people do though Yeah, now especially but it's like come on you can't do that like you know the new The new Popeye design that they were teasing he didn't have any tattoos and he doesn't smoke a pipe He looks like a fucking little Abercrombie hipster somebody somebody was saying like oh, maybe it's like a prequel But I must don't think no, I think there was something else going on there. No, it's politics They don't want to promote smoking and they don't want to promote tattoos the new the new Popeye design We're wearing like his fucking like converse and I think they but they drop that movie I think you only did that to show to the producer. Yeah, it's just like a teaser or something, but still It kind of goes a lot you guys were saying I feel like what it comes down to is I think one of the things that makes something funny is when it's off limits because it's like You when you when you listen to a joke and it's an offensive joke you in your mind if it's funny You laugh at it because you know it's offensive, right? But you're aware that it's joking like it's and I think that's where jokes come from like if you make a rape joke and Like it has a malicious intent and it's not funny because your brain tells you like this joke is meant to be and it's like That's not funny and it's like when someone does a comedy bit. Yep, and they talk about the topic You know in your head like oh, he's making a racist joke the joke is racist, but it's clearly not That's why most of the time when you hear racist jokes It comes from a black person or a Chinese person or a Indian person and when you see jokes like obese jokes it comes from the fat person It's almost like it's okay because I'm that they're I think that should touch that ever comes from discomfort Yeah, I look

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:42.610 --> 0:35:43.200]: 
  Are you in?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:35:48.044 --> 0:35:48.111]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:53.460 --> 0:35:54.760]: 
  People like to be offended

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:00.987 --> 0:36:01.206]: 
  Well

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:10.926 --> 0:36:12.917]: 
  And the person was talking about lip jokes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:34.180 --> 0:36:35.243]: 
  and they can't refuse.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:00.302 --> 0:37:03.222]:

  No.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:38:58.073 --> 0:38:59.862]: 
  No, it's politics. They don't want to promote...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:08.924 --> 0:39:10.358]: 
  Yeah, nice sounds.

  Yeah, really.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:19.799 --> 0:41:30.150]: 
  Good You're never gonna find anybody who says rape is funny right seriously believes it or not a lot of it on the Holocaust or cancer Sure, none of the dude the world is full of things that seriously are not funny They're horrible life is pretty horrible if you look at it like if you really look at it sure It's got a lot of very bad things if you can take something like that and Take take a subject everyone goes Oh, they kind of freeze up about and you can make something funny out of that that's I think that's the best kind of comedy because you Go talk to my hey, you can talk joke about fucking corny You can talk about shoes you can tell all kinds of jokes, but you can make a funny 9-11 joke Not a lot of it's honestly the least funny thing ever happens fucking disgusting Sure, nothing about that's funny, but nothing way anything's funny If you can make death or alcoholism or AIDS or cancer if you can find a humor in that I think that's that's There's a beauty what it does is it allows for a conversation and by the way, you're not laughing at the subject, right? You're saying holy you're you're using that subject as a Foundation you tell a joke is a springboard, right? You're not making it the joke. You're not saying look Rip rip is funny people be forcefully, you know

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:11.352 --> 0:41:11.976]: 
  What it does is...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:30.825 --> 0:42:15.308]: 
  raped and traumatized or that's that's funny. No, you're not saying that you're saying this is a disgusting subject What's see what's if we can if we can find anything funny about not about this but with this as a cradle as a ball And then we'll fill the inside with soup or joked soup. No, and I honestly think that it opens up conversation like that that Richard prior Yeah, absolutely like that scene. It's like by by not talking about it and by acting like it's off limits I don't think it open it doesn't open up a dialogue about it doesn't open up understanding about it It doesn't and I think that the drawback though is that you get a lot of people who don't understand context Who don't understand empathy who don't who don't have experience? So then they just take the joke part of it without the actual

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:13.890 --> 0:42:17.164]: 
  Yeah, no, they hear the malicious. They think you're the malicious.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:16.050 --> 0:43:16.463]: 
  They think you're the malicious and they think that's the funny part and they just roll with that. Yeah, it's like oh you're laughing Did you know people get raped in real life? It's like okay, right? I also think I also think Human is therapeutic in a way like comedy but that jokes like that are funny And I also like one of my favorite comedians ever is nor mcdonalds They got gonna get anything funny. He I if you watch this special he did it the whole thing about Alcoholics and obviously get a bit about his dad die of a heart attack Yeah, like these things are just not funny, but he somehow made them funny You know, hopefully but he is he is a podcast you did a thing about 9-11. Yeah, so he made he somehow made it He made a fucking breast cancer. Angelina Joey get your tits cut off her breast cancer. He somehow Turned that into a funny thing that is the least funny thing ever He somehow made a laughter come out of that not not of that but out of that So to summarize, you know, nothing's up limits. I think I've gotten over I think I speak for other people when I say I've got over this with a worship my life from laughing at my body before stuff in it

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:19.223 --> 0:42:19.712]: 
  Yeah, it's like

 SPEAKER_04 [0:42:43.287 --> 0:42:43.557]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:42:49.919 --> 0:42:50.037]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:43:16.902 --> 0:43:18.454]: 
  Ouais.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:17.560 --> 0:43:30.739]: 
  If you look at the Joker comedians, I'm not pretty myself in that group, I'm saying the Joker comedians are very depressed people with whom... It's no way of dealing with shit. And I think that's true for a lot of people. Yeah. It's cathartic, in a way.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:30.739 --> 0:43:32.342]: 
  It is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:32.022 --> 0:46:01.602]: 
  The last thing I would say would be um, I know I leaked it on my Twitter But I swear to say I leaked it debate between Comedian Jim Gordon and this lady who was debating whether Things like rape jokes or soul are funny and throughout the course of the video this will be like like rape jokes like technically rape jokes jokes That involved rape But she was everything she wasn't realizing she was doing but the whole time she was like making jokes about racism Things like that, but she was but she was doing it like a mocking way, but it still got laughs right those were still rape jokes though She still told the rape they got laughs right that's that's the point to draw these arbitrary lines these things go well This is a real joke. Well, that's not a joke. You can't do that man Yeah, you can't draw the line where you think you can but you think an idiot if you're laughing at this and this and that But not that that's not funny She was making observations that other people were able to find humor out of whether she was yes And she wasn't it didn't you do it? Right and that it look that's a joke. Yeah, if you make people laugh and you told the joke I don't understand how like, you know like oh you can't make rape comedy jokes But you can make jokes about cancer and it's like isn't that that's my point It's either you know that's that famous quote by either tree park over that sort of for God who said it But everything's okay or nothing's okay exactly. There's no point You're gonna cut the line up here then cut the line up there and being unfair at that point It's that's basically how I feel about it personally like if I really wanted to dig deep and start making like I take a context of What's offensive and start making a well-written joke around it? Which would actually be a pretty good idea to try and make a cartoon around an offensive topic see if I could pull off But that's I should say none of us never never go out go out who could we offend today? Who could we say that's crazy? No, I used to be like that when I was at obnoxious faggot Well, every every kid every kid you kind of go out of that with you. Well, that's what I mean when I was an obnoxious faggot Yeah, I can't you know even if we I'll say I'll say like this Even if a joke we tell a shocking doesn't mean we set up or shocking doesn't mean it's a shock And this is something too because I just said it faggot like that's people are offended They're like because the you know the gray area between gay and annoying and it's like when I use faggot as a term I use it like a little shit a little annoyance like a fucking like You know something that's pissing you off. I'm never like it's not a derogatory statement to gay people And then it's like something again like there's you there's so many things to be offended about why worry about a joke It's like you could be offended about things that actually matter. I don't know. Do you guys want a silly question? Yeah, let's go silly

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:03.055 --> 0:44:03.190]: 
  All right.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:06.295 --> 0:44:06.615]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:05.717 --> 0:48:06.443]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:48:17.985 --> 0:48:20.162]: 
  for his face.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:20.061 --> 0:53:31.624]: 
  I don't know if you got I don't know I don't know if you guys like touching on how shit YouTube algorithms are But I don't know if we want to cover that again. I I went into a little bit on Twitter. I just want to say I just want to say I want to say something too with you when you're done Okay, I just wanted to say that a lot of people originally with the hit misses kind of the way this stuff that happened Everyone started doing cartoons then you realize you can make money doing it. Oh, well, then you started making more money Then you said okay And it started to come your job. This is over the course of like a few years Yeah, then after a while it turns out we started to lose money. Okay, that's fine We started to figure out kind of think out loud. Okay, this is happening. How do we fix this? It's just a heads up And then there's this reaction from the whole like oh fuck you what you think we think you deserve money for your cartoons You're pretty fuck those guy. I'll move on then. I'll get do something that actually gets me real money I'll go either go to a studio job with the traditional stuff whether that's TV or film And then there was a big outlast this in back like just said oh you lazy fuck wait I mean I'm a courtesy boy. You don't get the best of both worlds you either We look when you said get what people with the people the people who said get a real job for years When we got real jobs though, you fucking lazy bastard. Yeah, you don't get the best of both worlds I feel like and that's something that I could explain like over and over They don't they don't think the thing is the way the system used to be and the way it is now is specifically catering to a certain kind of Like not demographic but style of videos right the way the system is now is view time amount like of a video and Minutes watch so there's like three factors that affect that video now and even then so consistency your yeah Yeah, and there's a basic there's a second factor Which not many people know about it, but it is on the radar at this point I think more people should know about it is a term called subscriber burn Which is based on how many people actually do those three things of the video and how many people like let's say you skip a video You don't watch a video and that you goes by and you don't pay attention to it any way from the upload another one Well, the problem is the more that if you skip that video the YouTube systems is like okay He doesn't want to see that video So it's automatically taken out of your what to see feed and replaced with some other bullshit for you to see and what problem Problem happens is it starts weeding out all your subscriptions So you have to manually go to stuff because the new system It's like you know people he used to make millions of views back then and they upload a video and get 13,000 views Yeah, it's because they've completely been burned off the radar and when they release something They need either word of mouth from Reddit or they need Boosts from people they know that are popular and that's how the new system is it caters to and the way you let's play videos are Not to continue is it perfectly? engulfs that concept like you upload a video you want to see the next part so you sit through the whole video and You get all the minutes watched you can set your runtime to like specifically how long they want would just typically 10 minutes and It exactly caters to the system and I heard now the recently changing it We have to make a minute at least if you're an animator to even make a proper CPM and because of that It's like okay. Here's a fucking job. I do every day where I get paid and get I get paid at the end of a month and I even have enough to spend money on shit Or here's a job where I can barely make enough right it takes me like fucking six years to do one thing and the community It's shit to begin with so it's not even worth the payoff Yeah, you work like a fucking dog and then they say people like oh it took you to song. Where's my next one? I think one of the bigger problems It's not even YouTube anymore It's actually become like Facebook and other and other things because like with let's plays or live-action videos You see the people in it you hear the people in it. You know they made that content Yes, but when it comes to cartoons a lot of times people don't know who actually animated They don't know who's voicing in it So people rip them they cut out the credits and they fucking repost it up to like Facebook Oh, yeah, and Facebook has like the worst recording system or whatever But like or Imager or whatever like the Pac-Man cartoon that I did yeah has more views on on Facebook and Imager Then it like three times as many views than it does actually on YouTube So more people have seen this cartoon have no fucking idea about the people actually involved with it Then you know what I mean, and they just think it's the person who uploaded it is because it's like it's what it steals a lot of action video It's like oh, I know who this guy's exactly no That's why I'm saying animation is the perfect thing to steal and it's why they keep doing it because they just lop off the credits and try To credit for it There was that one like fat idiot who like used to make like truffle shuffle videos and steal your 90,000 followers on Facebook in like a week from your leviose me like hey make more of that make more of that video It was like I made this pretty sweet right? You're great waiting for you to upload more so you can fucking steal it I don't know what happened I stop paying attention but he would see videos of me It's like silly fat kid dances and he would just be like pulling his shirt up showing his kids I never even laughing like man. I found you through the leviose video. You're so funny That's some goonies by the way. Yeah, no, I know no that's what you call like a fat kid shaking in cities Truffle shuffle

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:26.052 --> 0:48:26.406]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:45.525 --> 0:48:46.605]: 
  This is over the course of the day.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:49:34.429 --> 0:49:34.784]: 
  and round the edges.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:34.784 --> 0:49:36.150]: 
  They don't hear you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:49:46.174 --> 0:49:46.596]: 
  Right.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:58.982 --> 0:49:59.438]: 
  And then so on.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:50:47.093 --> 0:50:47.346]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:46.695 --> 0:51:47.303]: 
  Yeah, pay off.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:49.277 --> 0:51:50.408]: 
  and then you just get people like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:51.910 --> 0:51:52.635]: 
  It's a glove.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:53.125 --> 0:51:53.867]: 
  I actually think

 SPEAKER_04 [0:51:53.867 --> 0:51:55.285]: 
  Thank you, man. Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:07.975 --> 0:52:08.009]:

  Bon Appetit.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:19.281 --> 0:52:20.479]: 
  yourself and get the attention.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:22.504 --> 0:52:23.112]: 
  and in the growth of the system.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:43.007 --> 0:52:44.948]: 
  I just think that the first in what floor it is involved.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:44.627 --> 0:52:44.695]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:52:47.834 --> 0:52:48.306]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:48.644 --> 0:52:49.116]: 
  I'm sorry.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:54.094 --> 0:52:54.921]: 
  Chris.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:59.123 --> 0:53:00.912]: 
  so steal your glucius, sir.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:00.912 --> 0:53:01.958]: 
  Not like we done it before.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:53:07.982 --> 0:53:08.505]: 
  video

 SPEAKER_04 [0:53:10.092 --> 0:53:10.935]: 
  Yeah, he's waiting.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:27.254 --> 0:53:27.540]: 
  No

 SPEAKER_04 [0:53:30.494 --> 0:53]: 
  Un fry the grubbel down.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:32.738 --> 0:59:39.465]: 
  Should we move on? Yeah. We have a bunch of questions. I don't know if you guys have any questions. I've actually made videos about my feelings about YouTube, so I don't need to talk to one another. Can I say one last thing though? Go ahead. Just one last thing. Realistically though, the kind of stuff I'm doing with Jeff, I would rather have my name on overspending ages on something that I would put on YouTube. I feel YouTube is more of an archive thing, but I feel like the thing I'm doing now is more like something I'd be like, yeah, I'd help do that, and it was well worth it. I'd still like to make animations and put them out there. I would too, but I would like to not be on somebody's fucking to-do list. It's like, okay, you have to do this to me before I kick my bucket. Maybe when I'm done this game, I'll make some more. I think after doing three-minute videos for five plus years, I kind of, when the mindset now where I just want to make like 23-minute videos, you can't do that on YouTube. I don't mean to keep going, but it's like another thing that bothers me, and it's like, you guys, we all get this, it's like, if you don't animate, people are just like, oh, they don't animate anymore. It's like, just because we don't upload stuff online doesn't mean we're not animating. I think this is the biggest thing. People will sue this because we're not making videos, we're not doing anything. We're doing more stuff. Animation is like, seriously, five percent of what we're doing. I'm animating every fucking day for like eight hours, and then I find time for other stuff, but I still always go back to it every single fucking day. It's like, I'm not just like taking breaks now and then. I think the best thing anybody can do is look at YouTube, look at the internet as a stepping stone and not a fucking bed. Yeah, treat it like the Bible. Honestly, now with the patrons and with the commissions that I have, YouTube is basically a dumping ground for me at this time. Exactly. That's all it is. Exactly. I mean, if I have a cute little idea, I want to fucking fart out. Yeah, I'll absolutely put it there, but for the most part, the things that I'm making, I'm making with my patrons, with the commissions that I have, and hopefully, they're things that I can share as well on the channel. But then also, then, you know, I don't want to say it on here, but then there's other opportunities that I've been exploring that are more television based. No, no, no, yeah. And I'd like to share, you know, whatever I can with that. And it's also like, it's not so much that I'm done animating. It's like, I'm done with YouTube. I would rather focus on Sleepy Cabin or my own shit. I'm not focusing on YouTube. I want to do stuff for this, do stuff with you guys. It's like, I don't want to have to worry about making a silly cartoon for like someone who's like, for a community who just fights for the funniest comments. And YouTube goes out of their way to ignore animators. Yeah, no, absolutely. Unless you're like, verified, they know who you are. Just so sad. So it's like, you get a fucking gold star. It's so sad. Hmm? These people, these animators, they put in so much fucking effort and... Yeah, there's a lot of really good animators. They have to be such, such uncaring cunts. Like, they could do something to help an animator out, but... I mean, it's Google. They're a multi-billion dollar company. They don't fucking care. They could help out the animators in their own way. They could, yeah. I mean, like, I would ever complain about myself or any of us, but the truth is, there are people that have it so much worse. People who put in more time than us who make longer cartoons. Oh, yeah, really? Who are fucking, you know, they graduate from Go-Balls or whatever, and they're, you know, getting like a thousand views. Would it make YouTube more attractive if there was just, if they just encouraged a little more variety to stuff? I don't know if they care. I said, I said there would be better if there was two systems. There was one specifically for the kind of stuff, like where you can get content out a lot. There's the artsy side where it's like, it focuses. So there's like two sides. There's the art side and then there's like the video side. You know what? They're going to go for the money. They're always going to go for the money. The gaming is like, taking over YouTube. Just like Twitch. Like, Twitch used to also have just in TV. Well, guess what? They dropped just in TV and then they just had Twitch. That's exactly what I mean. And then you couldn't even animate on Twitch. I would say that. But at the point of me saying that, I would be on my LSD trip, like fucking like going through visions in my head, they're coming out of my head. I'm just like, wouldn't this be great? Oh man, let's go back in time where everything was good again. The businesses see the numbers. They see numbers and that's what they go for. They could not give a rat's ass how much time and effort and care you put into something. They want their money, the end. If anything, it's not even there's going to be a second system. It's that they're weeding out the bullshit. They're like, okay, you don't make our requirements. You're gone. These guys make our requirements. That's why we get money. You guys fucking come in. It's like a kid. It's like a thing where it's like someone does a really good, like they come in and they have all this stuff to present. And then they're like, but they're not as cool. So it's like you're just like, then the other, they're like really cool kid who's like, yeah, put this out here. Dude, in five years, YouTube is going to be 99% game footage or gameplay stuff. It should be good too. And that's really, I feel like 95% of it is going to be like fucking compilations and video game. Yeah. Top 10s and shit. News bloopers and bloopers, it's hanging out with 40 million views. I'm just saying that I really think that it might even be pretty damn close to that right now. I think the best bet for anybody who uses the internet pretty much is like a portfolio. I think I don't think the internet's quite there yet. It's like a, it's, it's, we're getting there. But I think at this point you should use the internet as a stepping stone to come back when you have a steady job. Don't expect to make steady income off the internet. I'm saying that as somebody who did for a little bit, but you can't. You mean as an animator? As an, well, I guess it's anybody, dude, because vloggers who got their story, who became really rich, like Rayleigh Johnson, who did equals three, he quit his thing, but I can't imagine his career last year, which you loved. Do you know anybody who's not like non-animators that started out well, person, personally not, that, well, that, that aren't doing well now, that just totally dropped? There's so many. What the buck was huge on YouTube? I trust Steve, Fred, all these guys. All these guys like scraped like 10,000 views. Yeah, you see like someone like Shane Dawson, who was at the top of the charts. Let me, and you see Shane Dawson and he's, he's, he's grabbing any parody you can. Let me, let me, let me, let me pose this question, which is actually harder. How many guys can you name who started online, who are actually big now and doing what they do in our traditional media? That's still online.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:53:33.734 --> 0:53:35.573]: 
  Yeah, they have a bunch of questions. I don't know if you can...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:53:39.505 --> 0:53:40.365]: 
  I don't need it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:02.033 --> 0:54:03.130]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:54:02.505 --> 0:54:04.345]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:55.544 --> 0:54:57.214]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:35.571 --> 0:55:36.769]: 
  Oh, no, no, no, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:37.799 --> 0:55:38.406]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:55.619 --> 0:55:56.783]:

  I mean

 SPEAKER_04 [0:56:17.387 --> 0:56:18.805]: 
  Yeah, they don't fucking care.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:18.805 --> 0:56:20.610]: 
  They help out the animators in their own way.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:56:20.610 --> 0:56:21.387]: 
  They could, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:29.217 --> 0:56:30.060]: 
  Absolutely.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:39.730 --> 0:56:41.451]: 
  more variety to stuff.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:41.451 --> 0:56:42.447]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:58:28.894 --> 0:58:30.160]: 
  He would be pretty damn close.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:30.160 --> 0:58:30.987]: 
  I think I think

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:50.781 --> 0:58:51.794]: 
  You mean as an animator?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:10.694 --> 0:59:11.436]: 
  Personally not.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:10.761 --> 0:59:11.655]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:13.832 --> 0:59:15.385]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:59:45.186 --> 0:59:48.105]: 
  Wait, what? That does what? That's what you're doing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:46.755 --> 1:00:11.410]: 
  That started off on YouTube and actually moved on to what he wanted to do in traditional media. So, Phil... Justin Bieber? He was on YouTube. He was a YouTube sensation. The annoying orange is on television. Look at the cancel. He gets 10,000 views in a per video pretty much. Dave Bo. Oh. Yeah. This is kind of a different note. I'm not going to keep playing on this. But I'm going to say, I feel like, unless...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:54.653 --> 0:59:55.935]: 
  Yeah, he was on YouTube.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:55.935 --> 0:59:57.505]: 
  He was a YouTube sensation.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:57.505 --> 0:59:58.214]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:00.441 --> 1:00:00.694]:

  Oh.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:12.287 --> 1:01:30.520]: 
  Also like this if YouTube went down if you if you could find a job elsewhere I think those people will thrive during a better you have a talent you can do something you can look in a studio You can do whatever but all these guys who are vloggers who can only let's players to let's people who can only only only Only get an audience if they're constantly jump cutting those guys can't want to be actors They they only work in that setting and I feel like they they they should recognize that they're on a fucking timer The epic meal type guys they got like a show, but I got canceled or something All those guys get their five minutes favorite Maybe they do a couple independent movies or something and I think they fade away I think you see the ten years It's like did they end up like fucking MC hammers that they could they when they hit a big for a little bit They explode down my my biggest my store my barometer for how I like to judge it is basically this When I'm an old man and I'm talking to like my little grandnephews or whatever when I explained to them what I did During that period of time that they would be like oh, that's awesome Like I can show them what I did yeah, and they and that they would appreciate it that I can look back and be like I did this thing Rather than like I look back and I'm like I don't what was I doing? That was popular the time or whatever you hope so what's the next question for Chris? Where's demon vaults? All right next question

  I don't know how to say it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:01.907 --> 1:03:08.294]: 
  Any places in Malaysia I like? Mick, what part of Malaysia did you stay in? I'm from Malaysia and would really love to know your favorite spots back when you stayed there. Uh, well, I went to school in Umpam, I went to ISKL, and so I was in Kuala Lumpur. Um, and then when I went back in 2005, I was staying in Penang. Uh, I, I don't know, I just like... Where is Malaysia? Malaysia, Southeast Asia. So it's in Asia, right? It's above Singapore. Okay. I didn't know. It was somewhere in South Korea. I, you know, I really like downtown KL, especially when I went back. I mean, when I was there as a kid, it was still kind of like grungy, um, open sewers and shit, but uh, and I do remember on my way to school, uh, there was this big like reservoir thing, and I remember a kid pulling up dead fish from the, like this ground river thing, putting him in buckets and stuff. Yeah. But, um, I went back in 2005 and it was pristine, it was beautiful. I, I, I love Malaysia. Trista2 asks, what's the best advice you can give to a 17 year old who is about to turn 18 as a legal adult? Use condoms. Uh, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:24.030 --> 1:02:24.638]: 
  Malaysia.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:26.612 --> 1:02:28.688]: 
  So it's a native, right? It's above Singapore.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:09.205 --> 1:03:33.522]: 
  Do you have any bad news? Any stories about that? Just saying to use condoms. Alright. I have advice. This guy's still in high school I'm assuming. Yeah, I have advice. So I would say none of your life matters. Everything before you doesn't matter. High school, you're going to forget about it within one year. Have fun. Yeah, don't change anything you have going on right now. Like continue to live off your parents and take care of them.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:12.040 --> 1:03:12.580]: 
  I'm just saying...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:13.862 --> 1:03:14.571]: 
  All right.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:16.394 --> 1:03:17.237]: 
  Ø§ÙÙØ¨ Ø§ÙØ¨ÙØª

 SPEAKER_04 [1:03:21.068 --> 1:03:21.389]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:34.281 --> 1:05:22.129]: 
  You know, because I'm assuming that they're on their parents like... Well, they're 17 years old. Yeah, like medical stuff so they can go out and do like specific things that would help them in life. On your 21st birthday, don't drink 21 shots like an asshole. I would say this. If you're going to... Just speaking of experiences, friends of mine, if you're going to school for like a teaching degree or education, don't get caught underage drinking. That's bad. Yeah. Yeah, I was going to say... That fucks you for life. You know, this is advice that I don't even have for my own life. It's advice that I'm observing for new lives coming into this world, but everything is recorded. So don't just... Yeah. You know, look, I'm not saying you need to watch out for big brother, though you kind of do now, but just remember like if you're going to get a job, like if you want to be a lawyer one day or you want to be anything where your credibility is critical. It's on the line. Yeah. So don't do that fucking skinny dipping thing. Don't sleep. Don't try to take advantage of that drunk girl at the party. Don't do what I did. Don't do it. You know what I did? Everything will come back. Okay. Everything is going to come back to watch you. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something very important in life. Actory. Have good credit because it affects you in the future. That's a real thing. I can tell you right now. That's true. If you think credit is something you should ignore. Hold on. Hold on. I have an experience that I took credit for granted. I took ages ago in 2009. I pulled it alone because my mom needed it. So I pulled out the loan because like she needed money at the time. So I was like, okay, I'll pull it alone. She was paying for it, but there was a time where she just couldn't pay for it. So I was like, okay, I'll pay for it. But this is when I didn't have a job. I was kind of freelance animating for like YouTube and shit. And it was a bill that was.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:41.554 --> 1:03:42.735]: 
  Well, they're 17 years old.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:48.321 --> 1:03:48.996]: 
  On your 21st...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:48.996 --> 1:03:50.380]: 
  birthday don't drink 21

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:06.310 --> 1:04:06.647]: 
  see

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:31.538 --> 1:04:31.707]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:31.707 --> 1:04:31.875]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:04:38.946 --> 1:04:39.452]: 
  Don't do it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:46.050 --> 1:04:47.012]: 
  I need to eat some more.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:23.125 --> 1:06:52.140]: 
  I had paid off like half of it, so I only owed $500. Stupid enough, I was just like, they would send a thing, they'd be like, you're dropping, like you're gonna be in juvenile, or not juvenile, fugitive, something, for your loan score, and I was just like, I was like, fucking do your worst, I'm not, if I ain't paying you $500, I got shit to worry about, I got phone bills, I got rent, I'm like, suck my dick, I haven't been at school in fucking four years, I kissed my ass, I was like, oh, super cool, almost got a smoking cigarette, but what ended up fucking happening, was I tried to get a place, and I paid it off, as of recently, yeah, this is like a year ago, I paid it off, but here's the thing, you can't just pay off credit, if you were dropping credit score, paying off something is like, you have to work your score back up. It's like, good job, you got credit, but here's the fucking kickoff, like here's where it fucks you, once you're in the red, I don't know how you can get back from it, because in order to get a credit card, you have to at least be in it. You have to pay your bills. You need to, look, seriously, what I did, which was very stupid, which couldn't build good credit, but I didn't do this, I paid for my car in full, that's a very, very bad idea, that does not build credit. No, you want to get a credit card, and you want to pay it off every month. Exactly. You pay that every month, you pay the car, and pay the bills every month. They need to make using a credit card easy as using a debit card, to encourage you to use your credit card, because...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:01.245 --> 1:06:01.937]: 
  as a reason.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:12.062 --> 1:06:13.767]: 
  You have to work your score back up.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:06:13.024 --> 1:06:13.294]: 
  It's a

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:24.094 --> 1:06:25.478]: 
  You have to pay your bills.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:37.797 --> 1:06:38.100]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:06:38.100 --> 1:06:40.699]: 
  You want to get a credit card and you want to pay it off.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:40.699 --> 1:06:42.420]: 
  Every month exactly

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:52.748 --> 1:08:58.787]: 
  I can just pay with my debit card and it's done with with the credit card you pay and oh you have to remember to go into the account and pay it off You don't pay that bill you get fucked with Or you get an angry phone call, angry phone call from the bank oh you forgot to pay, I have the money to pay it off I just forgot It's like I'll fuck this I'm just using my debit card so my credit probably isn't bad but it probably isn't good either it's just zero neutral That's the thing for me my credit is abysmal and I'm not, right now I'm working on going to the credit bureau and getting my fucking birth certificate because I don't have that on me So it's a fucking huge hassle but it's definitely something you should never overlook, never overlook your credit it is very important in life If you want to get a fucking loan, if you want to get a fucking apartment, even if you have the money because I have the money I have first months, last months rent and I have rent for days and fucking years but the problem is it doesn't matter you need good credit or you get an apartment Another piece of advice turning 18 is to try to travel if you can Travel cheap, try to find international friends that are around you can crash on their pads or whatever But this is a good time to go do it before you gotta hunker down and get a job and then you get roped to the ground So while your chain is untethered I'd say try to travel as much as you can That's a really good advice Yeah I'm glad I got to do a little bit of that even if it's just cross country Go on a trip, go see stuff, go places you never went before and if you can bring a friend and if you can go see friends And do all that before you come back and go get locked down Yeah and like I said avoid any stupid felony shit, do what you're supposed to do Yeah don't commit felonies If you're doing something you're not supposed to be smart about where you do it Like if you're doing quote unquote drugs you should do them in a place where you're not gonna get caught Don't do them at the club, don't do them in your car Don't do them and then go out on your way to the club Don't be a fucking idiot Yeah no it's pretty simple Don't fucking do something Or if you do do something be smart about it

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:58.874 --> 1:07:01.337]: 
  and pay it all. You don't pay that bill, you get fucked.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:01.337 --> 1:07:02.502]: 
  before you get an angry phone.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:13.437 --> 1:07:14.247]: 
  That's the thing for me.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:07:34.885 --> 1:07:35.172]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:07:46.073 --> 1:07:46.124]:

  Do them and then go out on your way to the club. Don't be a fucking idiot.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:59.613 --> 1:11:36.417]: 
  I have a pressing question. Okay. From self-proclaimed sir. Is that a real name? Yes. This is his birth name. Mr. Self-proclaimed. He came out. What is the most important part of a sandwich? Go. Either the... I would... I would tie it between me and... Or cheese. Or the cheese. I'll tell you what, cheese always hangs me up because I can never decide between sharp cheddar and provolone. I... I'm doing Swiss lately and it's always good for me. The most important part of a sandwich? What's a sandwich without the bread? Easy. Exactly. Chris. Chris nailed... Chris nailed the coffin. He buried it and gave his mor... Yeah, but just... But just salad went out the bread. Exactly! Make little meat and cheese roll-ups. It's... It's weird. I don't... I don't like having like cheese and meat. It's like you get the bread. You have that fucking like delicious salad. You're holding it. You can hold it. You don't just eat fucking like... You don't just mold it. I guess you could make a meat... Like a meat and cheese burrito, but I'm telling you, the bread sometimes makes a sandwich. Certain like... Like ingredients like certain flavors go really good with bread. Cory, you're gonna slip away and get the herb and cheese bread. Yeah. No, dude. Dude, the fucking like special bread, like cheesy bread and stuff? Yeah, that one. Herb and cheese. Oh my god. Why? Just keep this concise, heaveny Krishna ass basically. Um... Alright, if you were to just pitch a TV show again, like say tomorrow, what would you do differently from how you originally did it? Okay, so how we originally did it was... Bentley? We... We went in fucking with our... Our body language was horrible for one thing. We were looking down at the floor, we were scared. We were stuttering our words. You had your life replicately cut out to be... What we didn't do like fool... Well, I guess we kind of did. We kind of practiced the pitch, but we didn't do it enough. But I would say... We did a couple things wrong. You know, the more time goes on, the more I realize how we fucked up. I would say actually the biggest thing is, don't walk in there with the ego. Yeah. We walked in there with the... We didn't have any ego. We were... We were clarified. An ego in this sense, not like a big deal, but like in the sense where it's like... You just want to humble enough? Is that the problem? You were not humble? Oh yeah, I didn't know that. It wasn't that. I mean like in the sense where... We were being too like prideful of pride. Oh, there was even that. Yeah, it was just... I'm willing to negotiate things. Exactly. But if you walk into a place, they go, Fuck you, get out. Yeah. Like if... You're gonna have to fucking budge on some things. Look, the first time... I would say pick what the ego came sticking to this. Everybody else I can kind of talk to. But no, this is why we didn't budge. They were like, Okay, we've already got a show called like, Hell, Faggot, whatever. We used to take calls and it was... Yeah, they were like, We want you to change the name of Hellbenders. We were like, No. And they were like, Fine. Whatever. Yeah, it's just like, Oh, okay. You know what? If we went back now, It would be like, Yeah, let's just call it the Gooseberry Brothers.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:04.795 --> 1:09:05.504]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:30.216 --> 1:10:30.959]: 
  We did and

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:47.125 --> 1:10:48.677]: 
  We didn't have any ego.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:53.875 --> 1:10:55.039]: 
  You just want to humble enough?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:54.449 --> 1:10:54.972]: 
  temple and everything.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:57.115 --> 1:10:58.313]: 
  method

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:58.937 --> 1:10:59.832]: 
  I'd be like in a switchboard.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:11:03.375 --> 1:11:05.755]: 
  I'm willing to negotiate things.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:08.995 --> 1:11:09.349]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:13.247 --> 1:11:14.412]: 
  Look, the first time that was...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:24.081 --> 1:11:26.460]: 
  They're like we need to take all that it was yet they're like

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:30.325 --> 1:11:30.983]: 
  Whatever is it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:37.919 --> 1:12:30.130]: 
  Stupid title, but I would just say be willing to negotiate don't walk in with it I don't want to say ego. I don't mean to say what's like. I'm a big deal Do you know who I am? I mean a sense what it's like look Let me just do my idea because you're gonna have every show on TV has fucking been negotiating or realistic Oh, we saw it was originally gonna be about fucking actors in Hollywood But they look at the network because I got some bad idea make up make them guys and fill it up here Like you have I think it's good to have a certain amount of pride in terms of like that What you are bringing to the table, but I understand what you're saying there's a level I'm not saying be their bitch, but I'm also saying don't sit there. Go. I'm not gonna budge You have to be willing to fucking talk because I'm not gonna work They're just not gonna work with you I guess when you if you were doing your pitch if I could say anything you walk in and you just be humble to anything They sort of say we were humble Chris and I we were like hey look at me No, no, I'm not saying I like to be but like they're

 SPEAKER_04 [1:12:27.480 --> 1:12:28.830]: 
  No, no, I'm not saying-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:31.277 --> 1:12:39.799]: 
  You definitely have to say, okay, I'll work with you on this, I'll work with you on that. Mm-hmm. Here's a question. There's a healthy balance. What's your question?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:36.981 --> 1:12:37.437]: 
  These are questions.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:37.437 --> 1:12:37.589]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:40.677 --> 1:13:02.159]: 
  Sorry, we re- No, go for it. Alright, um... Well, let's kind of ties into something earlier. Zach had a little back and forth with a mongoloid on YouTube about some guys- excuse them- selling out. All of us. And this question- yeah, I know, this- All of us? Uh-huh. This pseudo-intellectual cunt that plays the guitar and gets like three views per video. But anyway...

 SPEAKER_04 [1:12:41.790 --> 1:12:43.326]: 
  No, go for it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:43.495 --> 1:12:43.664]: 
  Hmm.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:03.120 --> 1:17:55.817]: 
  Fucking failure that will be forgotten by the annals of history. Anyway, you know who you are Next question. Yeah, this guy said roasted six asks. How would you guys define selling out? Give you up on your beliefs. It's very very. See he's got it doing something Something you would not normally do in exchange for money. That's it. That's it the end next question. Okay, let us put it He's like Selling your work a okay And that's funny that's funny because that's something people think like to go on it like people think like oh You're selling your own merchandise. You fucking sell out there They don't understand the concept that you're making making money off your own stuff It's not and people are giving it their own money for it. Yeah, people choice. Yeah, it's like you're not you're not selling like Like it's not like fucking like a Dragon Ball P on Doritos cups and shit It's not that I do that too. I wouldn't fucking give it shit. Yeah. Yeah, but But you would you would endorse Doritos you but I like the product I would do exactly I would genuinely like I would you're not know, but you're not gonna do something like you're not gonna endorse You know, you're not gonna endorse Ben gay or something like me and said look I want to put Goku's fucking retired face on our window. I'd say fuck you radio shit. Yeah, this shitty store I'm glad you're dying. What if they wanted to put it on like their Halloween RC cars? I would say go away You're a bad store stop asking me a million questions. We're trying to buy stuff You know when you're you know when you're selling out because you can feel it in your bones If you're doing it solely if you know that you would not ever even consider doing it until they gave you the price tag Then there's a very good chance of selling. I don't even care like I think the way I see it is if you're making something pure that you like Let's say a video game or movie And if somebody comes along as well, you know, we just want to sell toys of this It's almost like the core product is something that you like Look, yeah, and you they're just offering you a bunch of money to sell a bunch of shit kids will buy any like another thing It doesn't matter. You know product placement in movies Yeah, if the product placement doesn't affect your immersion, it's not incredibly important Like when growing up when you watch so many comedy movies You don't realize the subtlety of the product placement because it's not the main focus the main focus is the judge That's because it's like almost now people are almost on the lookout for it anytime Anything with the name on it You're like that's stupid People are looking for it, but it's also like how much it's like a christen how much in your face is it? I'll you shame this Yeah, yeah, it's for was fucking a No, yeah, I was a no see Fucking the dude crashes his fish the fucking blue Like like a fucking Budweiser baby. He comes out. He cracks it's like World War Z Brad Pitt gets chased by zombies and he locks him behind the door He walks over to a pristine Pepsi machine and he perfect takes one out It's like this disgusting orange background so the red Christine Pepsi can still somehow I don't anybody seen it But if any you want to like look up there's a clip on YouTube of a guy What shows that from it was from one of those is like from Hawaii 5-0 with the guys It's like a fucking detective thing and he's like hey, what are you eating? He's like, oh, I'm just I'm just seeing this chicken sandwich It's really good The girl the girl's like well really you know But he's explaining he's like it's not what you think you can actually get a deal right now If you can cut the scene out and double it as the actual ad That's what you know, it's product placement like the thing with World War Z and the Pepsi thing Yeah, that could easily be a commercial probably one out and put it right there The guy had like fucking like six sub like subway say it wasn't just one He was doing a fucking taste test they took they took the fattest guy on the show He's like eight and a thousand. He's talking about how healthy subway sandwiches are one kind of product placement I don't like is when they get like Shrek and he's like oh McDonald's milkshakes. It's like you're ruining the immersion Oh, yeah, absolutely. You don't want like Shrek going in and like you don't like the Shrek towards the shamrock shake Because it's like why does he have McDonald's in his world? It's fucking fairytale land. It's bullshit I hate to tell you but Shrek is a real character But you have to remember that funny joke. I'm making waffles waffles isn't in fantasy Waffles is man-made. It's not fantasy made. Holy fuck the immersion is gone I know when he's like I'm making waffles and then he said garlic should have said I'm making all potatoes mashed into a pan Yeah, he's like I'm making swamp grass soup

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:15.878 --> 1:13:17.734]: 
  giving up on your beliefs. It's very...

 SPEAKER_04 [1:13:24.518 --> 1:13:28.349]: 
  Okay, that is pretty simple as a

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:31.859 --> 1:13:34.440]: 
  ì¤ ltDR ìì²­ëê² ìíì´ ë¥ Colin

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:34.440 --> 1:13:34.997]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:34.997 --> 1:13:36.550]:

  Peace.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:57.981 --> 1:13:58.572]: 
  It's so easy.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:14:02.149 --> 1:14:02.487]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:14.181 --> 1:14:15.447]: 
  Radio shaking.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:14:27.242 --> 1:14:28.204]: 
  Stop asking.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:14:56.082 --> 1:14:57.870]: 
  product is something here that you like.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:15:09.244 --> 1:15:10.020]: 
  That is incredible.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:18.627 --> 1:15:19.319]: 
  after because

 SPEAKER_04 [1:15:25.056 --> 1:15:27.334]: 
  Yeah, but also sometimes it's like fake brands.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:15:28.077 --> 1:15:28.127]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [1:15:36.615 --> 1:15:38.016]: 
  You're shameless.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:41.982 --> 1:15:43.197]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:44.817 --> 1:15:46.454]: 
  It was a nonsense.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:15:49.491 --> 1:15:51.347]: 
  The fucking blue blood was just there

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:03.632 --> 1:16:05.927]: 
  Perfect. Takes one hour to drink it. Enjoy it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:08.104 --> 1:16:09.707]: 
  This is definitely a classic sound.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:09.707 --> 1:16:09.724]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:20.254 --> 1:16:21.452]: 
  It's all the subway.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:21.452 --> 1:16:25.519]: 
  Oh God, I saw that!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:38.462 --> 1:16:40.437]: 
  And then the girl, the girl's like, well, really?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:40.437 --> 1:16:42.462]: 
  You know

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:46.309 --> 1:16:48.047]: 
  That's so good!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:51.220 --> 1:16:52.300]: 
  You can cut the scene out.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:59.759 --> 1:16:59.826]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:17:01.075 --> 1:17:02.273]: 
  You probably would.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:17:03.049 --> 1:17:03.437]: 
  The guy

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:06.542 --> 1:17:10.069]: 
  It wasn't just one, it was like six of them. Like he was doing a fucking taste test.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:14.305 --> 1:17:14.879]: 
  Which is all right.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:31.568 --> 1:17:32.175]: 
  This is true.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:51.852 --> 1:17:52.577]: 
  Yeah, he's like...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:57.252 --> 1:19:36.359]: 
  If I was strike I would have killed Donkey Head. Jeff, next question! This is important. We're talking about product placement. Go for it, go. Wait Jeff, let me ask you something. What? Out of all the recent movies you've seen that aren't shitty garbage and not hot fucking sewage like Transformers and these fucking like Travis Dees, a movie you really liked where it broke the immersion because it had a product placement that just felt really out of place at the time. Oh, sorry, I know you have the answer. Go ahead, no, you can't name some of the movies. I just watched Age of Ultron and look, it wasn't crazy bad. I mean, they'd done it before, didn't they? With like Burger King or something? He's like, I'm gonna need a Burger King burger, like Tony Stark. No, no, that was an Iron Man movie. Remember he needed a peep when they found him? I don't like that. I don't think I did. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine. That's what he would do. I don't know if I would do it too if I was in the fucking desert. So that didn't take me out, but it's weird because that didn't take me out, but that was clearly product placement, but that did not take me out. It seemed like a very Tony Stark thing to do. But at the end of Age of Ultron, no spoilers, don't worry, Scarlet gets a Skype message. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And it's so weird because that sound, and I guess- It's a Birdman too. Is it? Oh yeah, yeah, in fact, when we were watching that, we all checked your Skype. Yeah, no, that's the thing. It's like, and even that is so subtle and it's, you know, whatever, whether it's product placement or not, it doesn't really matter and it shouldn't be, technically it's just Skype. You know what we all use it? Yeah, they're using it too. It humanizes them. But at the same time, as soon as I heard that Skype sound, I would just like- You guys don't need to use Skype. Yeah, I just rolled my fucking eyes like, ugh. Dude, I'll tell you the last one that happens when I saw it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:58.686 --> 1:17:59.024]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:25.382 --> 1:18:26.901]: 
  Sorry, I know you have the answer.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:43.506 --> 1:18:43.995]: 
  It's a new one.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:18:43.995 --> 1:18:47.219]: 
  Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:46.881 --> 1:18:47.202]: 
  Yes, please.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:19 --> 1:19:06.169]: 
  All

 SPEAKER_04 [1:19:10.489 --> 1:19:10.658]: 
  man

 SPEAKER_04 [1:19:11.468 --> 1:19:11.755]: 
  Is it?

 SPEAKER_04 [1:19:14.370 --> 1:19:15.113]: 
  Yeah, no, this is

 SPEAKER_04 [1:19:30.182 --> 1:19:30.554]: 
  Just like.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:30.554 --> 1:19:31.819]: 
  I just don't need you, Scott.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:34.637 --> 1:19:37.439]: 
  I- I think that's what happens when I saw, uh...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19 --> 1:19:43.311]: 
  Skyfall, there's a poet in the hacker who uploads a video to YouTube and puts it on his list.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:19:37.439 --> 1:19:39.919]: 
  Skyfall.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:42.062 --> 1:19:44.560]: 
  That movie is fucking trash

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:44.324 --> 1:20:28.418]: 
  Yeah, the heck was like you put on youtubers Can I say something? I really hate that fucking cliche if somebody uploading something to a YouTube type thing Oh, and then it gets a bunch of views I fucking hate that cliche That fucking lady, Am, she's like we're ruined and it has like nine views. It's like yeah, you're really not Cuz it's like if it's like that it's like these videos get like a obnoxiously high view I'm not having any more kick ass Every single movie YouTube it always has like 50 million views and like four likes It's not even a realistic number it's just like yeah, exactly. It's like fucking look movies It's always like one-tenth the likes of the views just fucking learn that. Thank you. Amen

  Oh, and then he gets a bunch of hues in a tiny little...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:56.001 --> 1:19:57.452]: 
  I can hate that cliche.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:07.493 --> 1:20:13.804]: 
  Honestly, I

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:10.497 --> 1:20:11.003]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:58.842 --> 1:24:30.760]: 
  BIRTHDAY ON! Let's get out of here dude. What a day. You cannot deny it, that would be funny. John Oliver talking normally with a deaf person. Jackson Soros asks, what's your ideal coffee like? Ice, extra sugar, etc. Very very dark coffee with some French law cream. Easy. That's it. One big strawberry. Easy. I get it all the time. Yeah. Like if I make it on a brewer on a brewer, normal. Just cook it up, make it, and then drink it. But if I go order it at a place, if I go to Dunkin's, yeah. You drink black coffee? Yeah, normally. But if I go to something like Dunkin's, there's a specific thing I want. I want turbo, I want a smidgen of cream and no sugar. Either large or extra large. But I don't want extra large anymore, because I fucking ranted about why I want extra large. You know what? It's true. Check out the cartoon with Cory Ranham at Coffee. I ordered an extra large leafy cabin. I like it black, thick, rich, sludge. I'm not going to make a joke here. So stop it, make it. And if I do go to Starbucks, if I have to, I will generally always order a clover press. It's a reverse French press apparently or something. It has very low acidity. But it's a little bit more expensive. And it takes a while for them to make. But it's fucking tasty. I'm a fan of cappuccino with a little bit of cream. And that's it. I just can't have too much cream in my lunch. If it's cheap coffee, I will add sugar. It cheapens the value of coffee. Yeah, but I would take a dial or something. I'll have like cream and sugar.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:23:03.482 --> 1:23:04.444]: 
  Right, fast liked it.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:04.444 --> 1:23:06.014]: 
  You cannot deny it! That would have been...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:08.089 --> 1:23:11.177]: 
  example and uh...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:24:22.170 --> 1:24:22.221]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:24.010 --> 1:24:25.157]: 
  Too much cream.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:28.026 --> 1:24:28.853]: 
  Bye, good talking.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:31.604 --> 1:24:32.447]: 
  I like big...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:32.447 --> 1:26:52.830]: 
  fat coffee club. Shekelstein asks, sorry, who came up with the idea of all living in the same place and how were you all convinced to live there? What idea that just like happened over like, we were all friends, you want to live with your friends. Newgrounds is in the area, I moved here, Stamper was already working at Newgrounds. This wasn't like, this wasn't like fucking like the good old boys, we all planned this when we were younger, this was just something that happened, it was just a series of events, I knew Chris, I knew Stamper, I just moved in with Stamper when Hans was there and then Chris came. Basically, what order did everybody move in? I was there before you. Chris was there before me. Stamper grabbed the house. It was me, Stamper and Mike, I think, enjoy, I think. Yeah. Wait a minute, she was enjoying it. It's like if you have a big boot on and you step in a pile of shit and then you try to rub the shit off in the grass, you know what happens? It collects a bunch of grass. So essentially, just more people just gathered like a boulder, like a snow boulder. Yeah, I think what it was, I think more or less what it was, it was one of these things, it was kind of a snowball effect. What basically happened was what I remember, this is, I don't know if this is, but this is just from my point of view, when I came, Chris was staying with Hans and it was Hans, you and Stamper and Mike, that's what it was. What, me? No, to Chris, it was Hans, Stamper, Mike. I wasn't here. Mike. Mike. Sorry, I don't know why I said that twice. Sorry. But yeah, and then Mike left and Zach had already been here. I wanted Zach to come because we all, like you could work with Chris and it was just way easier for you to just come and live here. So then Chris. I mean there was points where I would come for four months in a time pretty much. Yeah, and Jeff has always been next door neighbors to that house. And then Shad came. I'm always around. He's always around, man. And then Shad and Lewis moved in. Yeah, then Shad came. Shad came where he was looking for a place and I'm like you should totally come here and he was like yeah, okay. And I was like oh, all right, I didn't know if he would because it was kind of like. That's what happened with Stamper, me. He just offered out of nowhere and I was like cool. But it was cool. I'll admit I thought Shad, man, was going to be a total psycho. I was like are you really going to let him move in here? No, it's one of those things. But he ended up being like the nicest guy ever. No, it's that rule where it's like the people who draw the most vile or fucked up stuff are the most coolest people you'll meet. Yeah, and the people who draw the most baby shit are the most fucking introverse autists.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:24:43.095 --> 1:24:46.994]: 
  We were all friends. You want to live with your friends?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:50.504 --> 1:24:51.550]: 
  We'll be working with you guys.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:24:53.997 --> 1:24:54.284]: 
  land!

 SPEAKER_00 [1:25:00.544 --> 1:25:01.422]: 
  I don't know how it happened.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:25:04.324 --> 1:25:07.345]: 
  And then basically, in what order did everybody move in?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:25:10.112 --> 1:25:11.395]: 
  I grabbed the house.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:25:13.774 --> 1:25:15.900]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:25:15.900 --> 1:25:15.917]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:25:28.253 --> 1:25:28.540]:

 SPEAKER_04 [1:25:52.823 --> 1:25:53.447]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:26:15.182 --> 1:26:16.144]: 
  and then check game.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:26:17.123 --> 1:26:19.705]: 
  Yeah, and Shad and Lewis moved in.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:26:31.349 --> 1:26:32.462]: 
 ã¾ tilt

 SPEAKER_04 [1:26:31.365 --> 1:26:31.382]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:32.040 --> 1:26:32.378]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:26:34.875 --> 1:26:36.124]: 
  Isso aÃ­ wasn't me ddish

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:36.023 --> 1:26:36.495]: 
  I was like

 SPEAKER_04 [1:26:36.495 --> 1:26:37.238]: 
  But you see

 SPEAKER_04 [1:26:37.997 --> 1:26:39.111]: 
  No, it's one of those things.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:26:40.174 --> 1:26:40.900]: 
  No, it's- it's-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:49.017 --> 1:26:50.822]: 
  Yeah, all the creepy bits like fuck it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:53.539 --> 1:27:06.195]: 
  No offense, they're the kind of people who like fucking, yeah. They like step on cat heads and have people spit on them for fun, for sexual gratification.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:27:04.491 --> 1:27:04.795]: 
  Thanks guys.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:27:05.790 --> 1:27:07.005]: 
  Specifically the door that they

 SPEAKER_02 [1:27:07.005 --> 1:27:38.984]: 
  for any person what I'm basically saying is anyone who's ever made friendly family stuff now I'm the internet at least you know it's one of those things where it's like No, it's not that kind of stuff. It's like that awkward campiness where those jokes are just like, uh-huh I'm not a 12 year old, so I don't think it's funny, but then that's not always true You kind of got to pick and choose but for the most part. I don't think it's like it's just I guess it's a cognitive bias But it's a bias. I've come to what's like understand over experience I just choose to believe everybody who isn't offensive on the internet is a pedophile. Yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [1:27:12.490 --> 1:27:13.300]: 
  the internet at least.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:27:38.579 --> 1:27:38.697]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:27:39.861 --> 1:29:49.596]: 
  I just played that way. Williams, I wanted to ask. So, yeah. People always say back in my day, or people always say back in the day, everything was always better. Do you guys think anything has gotten better, or are you all cynical? Yes. Look, if you're retarded enough to say that things were better 20 years ago, we had worse stuff than you're an idiot. No, things have absolutely gotten better. Anyone who says, oh, I used to be so much easier back then. Well, some things get worse. Well, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what? Like, the whole gaming industry is way worse My point is now you have every other good game from the other decades, plus new games. Yeah, no, but what I'm saying is like, you have, my point is it makes no sense, unless the culture that you lived in fell into a fucking, I would say, you're a whole thing collapsed. I would say it revolves around certain things, for instance. Every movie, every piece of music, every video game, every decade. What I'm saying is that there was no effort back then in making games and making movies. I would say definitely some things are cut and dry, but I would say that a lot of things are much easier. Yeah, most things are better. Like, phones are way easier now, but then there's like a payoff where you don't have as long as you're working. You recall the things that were great back then. You're recalling the best stuff, there was still fucking garbage. No, yeah, that's true too. Bill, like the amount of good movies that's coming out are probably pretty consistent, like Play of the Apes. Yeah, no, that's also true. I also feel like it's kind of like, again, I'm using the term, but it's also like a bias because it's like things, it was like new ideas at the time, like they hadn't really been done before. It was kind of like a new thing. And then like since, it's like the bar has been so high for video games, even though it really shouldn't be, but there's this like invisible bar that no one really talks about, but then it's like it actually does come up, where it's like games have advanced so far that they have this huge regiment where you need like amazing graphics, you need like realistic like animation, and you need just like a fucking intense engine that can like- The thing is, it's not that I denied it, I just think the numbers are really exact. No, no, no, but also like, when a new game comes- Fuck yeah, you're a little shit. Fuck you, dude? No, I'm sorry. The fucking, when a new game comes out, right? Because it's a new game, you have to put all this effort into photorealistic- Exactly, do it in your best trophies, I'm not impressed.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:27:41.025 --> 1:27:41.498]: 
  Williams A.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:27:41.498 --> 1:27:43.557]: 
 ohnet asks so yeah

 SPEAKER_04 [1:27:53.412 --> 1:27:53.766]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:28:04.296 --> 1:28:05.494]: 
  Well, some suit better.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:28:05.494 --> 1:28:07.334]: 
  What? What's up?

 SPEAKER_04 [1:28:08.447 --> 1:28:08.549]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:28:09.527 --> 1:28:09.932]: 
  Like

 SPEAKER_04 [1:28:19.838 --> 1:28:20.378]: 
  Say...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:28:21.087 --> 1:28:22.875]: 
  I would say it revolves around...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:28:23.550 --> 1:28:24.799]: 
  for his business.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:28:26.183 --> 1:28:29.204]: 
  What I'm saying is that we're talking about

 SPEAKER_03 [1:28:29.204 --> 1:28:30.047]: 
  in prior.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:28:37.472 --> 1:28:39.008]: 
  Most things are much easier. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:28:39.008 --> 1:28:40.999]: 
  Most things are dark wood glitter. Oh, like so sweet.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:28:44.948 --> 1:28:45.353]: 
  charge

 SPEAKER_01 [1:28:51.006 --> 1:28:51.242]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:28:56.659 --> 1:28:57.874]: 
  Yeah, that's also true.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:29:07.037 --> 1:29:08.961]: 
  It was kind of like a new thing. That's also true too.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:29:20.335 --> 1:29:20.655]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:29:32.164 --> 1:29:33.210]: 
  I can like, do something.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:29:35.640 --> 1:29:35.725]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:29:39.471 --> 1:29:41.732]: 
 assed you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:29:50.744 --> 1:30:07.500]: 
  Okay, go on Chris. Are we done here? You were not done here. Stop fucking contorting your face dude. I don't think I ever think back about like, Wait I wasn't, wait. No Chris, Chris it's up to this hand. I wanted to say, we can't know though, who's gonna keep laughing every time we're gonna start talking, who's gonna have it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:30:00.261 --> 1:30:02.505]: 
  Wait, I wasn't... No, Chris! Chris, it's a...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:30:06.269 --> 1:30:08.007]: 
  Thank you sir, I'm very good.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:30:08.969 --> 1:35:15.098]: 
  Go ahead Chris. Look at this little troll. Chris, go ahead. Fucking, what I'm trying to say here is fucking when a game comes out now, the photorealistic graphics take a lot of time to make, right? Oh yeah. And the photorealistic graphics and production values and the sound design and all this stuff masks a badly designed game way, like, a lot. So all these games, like, are designed very poorly, but people don't seem to notice because they don't really know what they're getting into. What did you do to happen without playing land? I guess it's also, I guess that kind of cuts into something I kind of wanted to talk about is like, this is something I want to talk to you, Jeff. It's kind of like an idea, I guess I'm going to segue into it is since we have all these cut and dry stuff where it's like, oh, we get the same, you know, I'm someone who hasn't really gotten into the series, but oh, Call of Duty, it's all the same. We get the same gray matter, the same boring fucking like cut and shooter, oh, I duck, I shoot, I get hit once, I'm dead on the ground and then someone comes over and stabs me. It's like, you get that. I am completely biased when I say this, but it's like people feel that we live in this gray area where it's like, oh, everything's so real. I remember when it was just fucking four polygons and we had fun. And it's like, now things come out and they bring back the stuff that we remember. And it's kind of like, it makes you wonder, like, it's like a game comes out, like, for instance, the Banjo-Kazooie guys are coming out and they're making a new Banjo-Kazooie game, which I'm completely for. I think it's fucking amazing. But I also have doubts that it's like, it's been too long. Stuff has come this way and it's like, I don't necessarily want the same Banjo-Kazooie experience. Well, also, did the guy who did Mega Man, did he do a Kickstarter game with 2.Horror? No, it was the fucking executive producer who did it. It wasn't even the real Mega Man guy, but I think what it was... Did he get like, 2.Horror? You got a bunch of money. What it comes down to is I feel like Nostalgia Glass is fuck. A lot of people's memory of what they remember a game used to be. And it's like movies too. People announce Zoolander 2 and I fucking rolled my eyes. I'm like, yeah, okay, you're gonna get the same enjoyment you got from Zoolander 2. And then I thought Dumb and Dumber was gonna be trash. I was right. The sequel's awful. But it's like, what I'm basically saying is I feel like people want the old stuff because it was more simpler back then. But like, you know, like... It's Nostalgia. Yeah, yeah. There's a lot of Nostalgia Clowning. Like, just something about like Symphony of the Night or something. Yeah, the original programmer slash co-creator of the Symphony of the Night, he released a Kickstarter today. Oh. What day is it today? The 5-5-11? Should I bring up... Do you guys know what the name of it is? Symphony of the Night 2, the symphony? It's... And the designer's Kickstarter games, man. Man, hold on. I gotta talk about this for a second. Shoal of the Night was Kickstarter. Okay, that's fine. That one gets a pass. It's like no one. No, I don't mean indie. I mean actual game designers like, and from the past doing it. You know what it comes down to? It's like, oh, oh, that one guy did like core art design for it. It's gonna be the best game. But he wasn't the one who animated it. He wasn't the one who did the music. Games are a collaborative effort. Exactly. And but that's the thing. I was always like the costume designer for Robocop. It's like, cool. You weren't the writer though. No, exactly. And that's what people don't seem to realize. It's like, but they see that. They're like, perhaps you didn't know. This guy was the makeup designer for one of the new Marvel movies. And it's just like, and he's doing a Kickstarter for a fucking Marvel like, like it's own like Marvel breakaway, like it's own superhero story. Right. And he didn't make up for it. But it's like, okay. But it's like, you're not going to get the same like validity. Oh my God. It's so fun. Yeah, here's the thing. So games are like, games are a team effort. It was just a program already. It's like, yeah. All right. So the Castlevania Symphony of the Night, this game is called Bloodstained Ritual of the Night. Terrible. It looks exact. It has it's it's basically a carbon copy of Castlevania. The main character is the same color scheme as Alucard from from Symphony of the Night. They were asking for half a million or they're already up to a million. Do you know that? You got up to half a million and one day or they're up to a million, nearly a million now in one day. They pitched this thing with one bad Photoshop screen, one bad mocked up screenshot and that is it. They just took us still from Symphony of the Night. There was one guy. It's one drawing. There was one guy called PaperBat who's a YouTuber who did a Kickstarter for a game called Project Roxavia and he all he did was release concept art. He took, he got like $13,000 and ran with him on it. He ran with it. He never fucking said a word about it. That man's a fool. He's like a let's player. Yeah. And he did, he's doing another Kickstarter for a different game. And he never finished the first one. No. Not even finished but just ignored it pretty much. But Jeff, do you see what I mean? Like people latch onto that. They're like, oh, this guy coded. Oh, there's this design looks like we want. They badly, I understand what they want but it's like looking at, you know, like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:30:33.370 --> 1:30:33.690]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:30:41.385 --> 1:30:41.655]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:31:41.157 --> 1:31:41.798]: 
  Well, also,

 SPEAKER_03 [1:31:51.569 --> 1:31:52.564]: 
  You don't even have to watch your body.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:32:37.350 --> 1:32:40.067]: 
  Oh. What day is today? The 5-5-11?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:32:43.898 --> 1:32:44.826]: 
  I didn't even know about that.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:32:48.201 --> 1:32:48.252]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:32:54.327 --> 1:32:54.394]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:33:09.227 --> 1:33:11.995]: 
  The waves are a collaborative effort.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:33:09.413 --> 1:33:09.497]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:33:13.176 --> 1:33:14.070]: 
  But this is it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:33:17.192 --> 1:33:17.952]: 
  Yeah, you're worth a lot.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:33:17.952 --> 1:33:19.268]: 
  No, exactly.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:33:36.801 --> 1:33:36.970]: 
  Right.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:33:36.970 --> 1:33:37.172]: 
  He

 SPEAKER_00 [1:33:36.987 --> 1:33:37.020]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:33:43.517 --> 1:33:43.669]: 
  Oh my god.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:33:43.669 --> 1:33:45.104]: 
  Thank you guys. It's so much fun.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:33:45.660 --> 1:33:48.816]: 
  So games are like, games are a team effort, right?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:33:59.599 --> 1:34:00.055]: 
  It looks like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:34:12.677 --> 1:34:13.977]: 
  For half and not eight or something like that.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:34:27.831 --> 1:34:28.320]: 
  And that's it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:34:29.805 --> 1:34:30.447]: 
  There was one

 SPEAKER_00 [1:34:30.447 --> 1:34:33.029]: 
  Oh god. It's red. It's red.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:34:51.186 --> 1:34:52.485]: 
  That man's a fool.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:35:07.099 --> 1:35:10.457]: 
  This guy coded. Oh, there's this design looks like we were doing a thing

 SPEAKER_02 [1:35:16.515 --> 1:36:07.056]: 
  It's like, you look at this and you just question everything about it almost. You know, like the one piece of concept art, there's one enemy design, which is basically a lion head with like five legs sticking out of it. I think this is really... You're going to make a Kickstarter for a game at least to a fucking playable devil or something. This is gonna be... I don't want to sound like... What the fuck is that? Show me. I don't want to sound rude. What the fuck is that? What the fuck is this? This is what they're selling the game with. I don't want to sound rude, but I feel like this is gonna be the mighty number nine effect. Yeah, it is. Where they have stuff... Because let me tell you something. Mighty number nine had really awesome looking concept art of what potentially it was going to be, but when it was fucking released, it was like... It looked like this awful kind of thing. Do you know the look of it? So what happened? What was the end result of this? Uh, disaster. And it looks nothing like the original concept. They're not getting the game that they paid for. Yeah. I... I...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:35:26.759 --> 1:35:26.826]: 
  Thanks for watching. I hope you enjoyed this video. I'll see you in the next one.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:35:26.826 --> 1:35:27.906]: 
  I think this is really cool.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:35:32.310 --> 1:35:33.289]: 
  C'est Ã§a.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:35:34.757 --> 1:35:37.896]: 
  What the fuck is that? Show me. I don't want to sell food. What the fuck is that?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:35:41.355 --> 1:35:43.566]: 
  I don't want to sound rude, but I feel like this is gonna be the most

 SPEAKER_01 [1:35:44.967 --> 1:35]: 
  MBC ë´ì¤ ì´ëììëë¤.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:35 --> 1:35:45.287]: 
  It is.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:35:56.442 --> 1:35:58.990]: 
  it's like awful cut the baseball ball field-

 SPEAKER_00 [1:36:00.424 --> 1:36:03.242]: 
  It's a disaster and it looks nothing like the original product.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:36:08.237 --> 1:37:38.468]: 
  uh, two things I would say I've only ever donated to two Kickstarter things one was, I can't remember one of them the second one was, I think, a documentary called Fight for Space or Flight for Space I didn't do that one Yeah, you didn't do that one too, what the fuck that was like three years ago dude I think the thing is that guy, at least there's still proof he's working on it He always, I always get emails from that one, it's like hey and it's, but I'm still like man, that was like three years ago but then he made a second Kickstarter and realized I'm not doing it Oh, for the more money? Yeah, I didn't donate to that Dude, I really appreciate the cars and I really appreciate all the people you have on but at some point you just need to fucking come down I feel like the hardest thing is these people just don't understand every time they try to set a budget it should be like quadruple what they thought it was Exactly, because what happens, like with that guy, he was, he's not being disingenuous he's not running for money, but what happened was he was being too humble and asked for like half of what he needed so pretty much you site, you fuck with the audience and then you don't get to do it and you kind of waste their money maybe you get a boost to do like half what you need to do but it just kind of fucks everybody Even with this Castlevania game, it's like if they would have just hit their half a million dollar budget there's no way they would have been able to finish it Four million? Yeah, he was still like, I can't finish it, sorry No, yeah, you know what happened was But the budget was like two or those dollars It was poor budget management and he didn't, but What did he ask for? He asked for more money because he couldn't like manage the fucking budget What was he originally asking for? I think it was something like 200, 300, 400, maybe, maybe 200, maybe 240,000 I believe It was a couple hundred thousand at the point He got four billion dollars was like, yeah, sorry, I can't do it But you know, someone like

 SPEAKER_04 [1:36:26.361 --> 1:36:27.255]: 
  Theory.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:36:34.394 --> 1:36:34.444]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:36:35.541 --> 1:36:37.144]:

 SPEAKER_04 [1:36:42.426 --> 1:36:43.287]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:37:10.472 --> 1:37:12.447]:

 SPEAKER_04 [1:37:38.468 --> 1:37:39.059]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:37:39.059 --> 1:39:41.504]: 
  I guess it's weird because like you know those guys um They make great games way forward. They did that thing for a Chante and that game like you know It you know they're way forward. They made good games in the past very simplistic like their girls are cute and they make these games And it's like again like um Skull girls they had a goal, but they they were very community oriented Which is something not a lot of kick starters can do but they were already like in the community So they would reveal stuff they had artists who work behind the scenes who would like show off secret screenshots And it was just very like fun on its production. The reason Skull girls got done is because the programmer Was very pat very very passionate about fighting games. He knew what he wanted. He knew how to make it And they hired talented talented animators and they had a they had a proper budget It's pretty fucked up when you keep up to a kickstarter and then you change things after you get money Like I know there was a series called like a baby switch There was a series called bead puppy cat. Yeah, I get a pilot and then they did a kickstarter for a series And they changed the character designs for no reason. Yeah, no that's something for no reason It was a completely different art style like it wasn't drastically different But like the character designs were changed and the art style was different And people didn't get money to that art still they gave it to the other one Yeah, I think we're not a 90% of the comments were like this is what happened to the art style. I paid for it I don't see this dude. That's it. That's the mighty number nine effect. Yeah, the dis disingenuous. Is that the word disingenuous? Yeah, not being genuine. Yeah, and that's what it is. They weren't being genuine and when they released the product It was nothing like they wanted it was this like you don't get the change Once you get the money you can change as much as you want before you get the money but after that you're fucking locked in All right, guys. Listen, we got a lot more questions. Shut up. Shut up. We got a lot more. Okay, lighting round Yeah All right, guys, we got a lot we got a lot more questions to get through here, but uh, I want to make sure Fuck go All right, guys, it's getting a little bit late here, but we want to make sure we get through as many questions as we can All right, so we're gonna hit up a little bit of a lightning round.

Here's my music lifetime. I started off making ringtones in my Nokia 3510. Then I started importing mid-eye into Fruity Loops and looking at the how you make music with the chords. Then I started learning music theory on YouTube. Then I started learning to play piano. Then I became a master of music. Can anyone do that? Can I say something? Okay. When I learned music it was because I learned it from here. I just learned it from here. That's fine, I was making music. That was going, no, no, no, no.

I was good at asking, what is the dumbest way you ever tried to stay home from school? I was trying to be Peter Griffin. Shoot up bananas with some fucking peanut butter and then I remember waiting for my mom to come up to my room and I told her I wasn't feeling well and I sped it up. This is when I was about eight years old and I sped it on the ground. I hit him in the back. I did chicken soup. Didn't work too well. No, actually, one time I actually tried to get myself sick. Like, I remember they said if you, like, had wet hair and had a fan blowing on your head. So I actually did that. I got my hair wet and I stood in front of a... I slept under an air conditioner all night long hoping that I could get fucking sick. Really sick. I hid in the closet and locked myself in and freaked out and started hitting on it in the random afternoon. Because I was still tired so I kind of passed out on the close. After school's over though. No, it's time I figured out if you rub Vaseline in your hands and rub it on your face. What's the question? Stay home from school. Your head also slipped from the elbow. You need to go in this one. And to stay home from school to not go to school? I hid in my closet. Yeah, because they didn't see me.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:46:42.940 --> 1:46:46.230]: 
  I want to! We have to be in that war! I want to serve!

Corey, baby Corey floated down the sewers only to be watched up on the shores of the YouTube Let's Player University where he was accepted and they brought him up the stairs into the dean's office who then decided to give him a free scholarship. Okay, I learned the arts of being really funny and entertaining to kids. I learned how to dangle my keychain and fucking make babies coo. And little did they know I pulled out the max but I was actually a Jupy I'd Retard baby. And learning the deceit or whatever it is, they banished me from the Let's Play channel and I was forced to walk amongst the fucking leisure animation community. So I met a bunch of fucking mouth breathing retards to draw a gun walls. What was the name, Zach? What was the name, Jack? What was the name, Mick? It really, really, really hit some Elf boy named Chris. Elf boy? He walked in and said, hello, my name is Chris. Okay, this is garbage.
