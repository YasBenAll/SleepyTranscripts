  He goes to the hotel room because the hotel room is haunted. Oh. No, there's a- Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:24.439 --> 0:05:41.119]: 
  No, there's another one identity that takes place in the motel, but then I was also thinking there's another one I mean John Malkovich wasn't there another one room something something room like 432 He's in a lot of hotel rooms and movies. Yeah, is he in being John Malkovich? Yes. Yeah, that's the one I was thinking Yeah, never mind. Wow. Yeah, I actually in which case the hotel room was John Malkovich's brain. Yeah. Yeah So this son of a bitch asks for the room 401. It's his favorite. 401. It's his favorite. And the guy says Something that he's he's like well 401's very popular. So I'll have to see now. Here's the thing I've heard this story before now me earlier. Yeah, but what really kind of gets me Where it really kind of makes a twist is did the guy behind the counter sound a little playful? No, he sounded completely deadpan like okay, because you know what I mean? Like if it was more playful if it was more like, oh, yeah, I want room for one Well, that was really popular, you know in which case it kind of you know the banter like they're joking around Yeah, but the way that you describe it this deadpan description. Yeah, it's like a drug deal happening or something No, yeah, this is like he the tone was as though he went to a bank and asked to get a bunch of checks And like asking for the popular checks. Yeah, I'd like to get the pattern with the flowers on it. I have a question Yeah, what is it? What is it? What is like? Oh have to see like doesn't just know immediately or not?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:28.590 --> 0:04:29.991]: 
  John Malkovich was it?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:29.991 --> 0:04:30.632]:

  Okay.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:19.637 --> 0:05:21.105]:

  Why is it well, yeah, it's very popular. It's very popular. I'll have to go up there and check myself and come back down. Yeah, like, it's not in the computer. It's very popular. It's not in the computer. There might be somebody in there. We'll see. Yeah, like, what's the popularity of a random room in a hotel in the middle of nowhere? 401, you know. First of all, what kind of dude has a favorite room in a hotel on the side of the highway in the middle of nowhere? What best Western has a favorite room that's very popular? Oh, yeah, I've heard about this shit. Yeah. You know who got up there?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:15.494 --> 0:07:00.212]: 
  Four Chinese people to they don't go they don't have level four anything over there We just established two groups of people with whom the room is not popular. We're breaking it down slowly By deduction we'll figure out who's actually on this who's actually That's what I hate about Malaysia, too I don't know if I mentioned that before but in Malaysia because they have Chinese people and like British people right wherever they don't have a fourth floor or a 13th floor fuck So you just you have a 15 story building missing quote-unquote two floors half the numbers yeah But I mean like nobody puts it together like that just means the fifth floor is still the fourth floor We're tricking miss the supernatural yeah, right?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:27.996 --> 0:08:28.283]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:30.629 --> 0:08:30.645]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:34.087 --> 0:08:34.797]: 
  16 points.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:38.491 --> 0:08:42.592]: 
  Well, it's not a tourist destination typically.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:42.677 --> 0:08:57.527]: 
  I don't know what you wanted. I mean, it's like a best Western on an average road in an average town Is it like an industrial park? Almost. It's like car dealerships and shit. Not that that's, you know what I'm saying I don't know. I don't know where you go to get your kicks, Jeff I don't go to F***ing... You would f***ing check it into some best Western parking lot

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:46.710 --> 0:08:48.465]: 
  Is it like an industrial park? Almost.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:51.891 --> 0:08:52.735]: 
  I don't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:54.152 --> 0:08:59.974]: 
  I don't go to the hotel. You would fucking check it into some piss-watering. I wouldn't stay at a hotel in a town where I live.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:59.856 --> 0:09:04.277]: 
  Besides which there's three hotels in like tight proximity so it's not like there's a supply issue. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:03.619 --> 0:09:05.999]: 
  Yeah, I guess enough people will be staying in the area.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:05.999 --> 0:15:24.657]: 
  effort to warrant it to be there. Well, that happens. Sometimes when they have a chunk of work, like mining things or industrial things, they'll build up all these hotels to deal with whatever the demand is. Then once the job's dry up, they just got these empty-ass hotels, and then they sit there, and then some Indians from fucking Dubai like here from their third cousin. I'm glad you got the right Indian right now, when you said that. I was wondering where that was going. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no, no. Chief, not Chief 401. But fucking, they like, no, I do feel like it is very family-oriented. Like, I do feel like a lot of the best Westerns, like it's almost like they are all cousins or something. Well, they're franchises, but yeah, they're neutral as hell. Like, there's nothing special to rub anyone the wrong way. They got a pool, they got the silly-ass fitness room. Yeah. Is there a hotel chain that's below? Like, what's the worst hotel? I was gonna say Motel 6. Yeah, Motel 6 is pretty much down there. They're all single floor, and Motels are like single floor, right? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. So, two floor. You could get a two-story Motel 6. Is it that the door is open to the outside? What's the difference? The hotel and a Motel, what's the difference? Oh. I was given to understand that a Motel is that your room's door opens to the parking lot. Yeah. But I don't know if that's the only thing. I remember when I was... I don't, well, that could sound right, but I know in certain tropical places that they have beautiful Hilton hotels that have balconies right outside, you know what I'm saying? Right. They are pretty much all open. Yeah, I don't know, man. I'm sure it's a quality thing as well. It's gotta be. Because when I was, I remember when I was a kid, they had like a series of... The first time I ever even heard what a Motel 6 was, they had like all these like article pieces on the news, whatever the fuck, you know, investigative stuff. Yeah. Where they were like exposing how ratchet all the Motel 6's were like bugs and people... That's a franchise though, right? Like anybody can just own a Motel 6, right? Yeah, yeah. Because it's the same thing with like Best Western and all those things. Is I think once you get like a franchise going, that's where you get a real hit and miss. I mean, some of them I'm sure are real nice. Very, I mean, you know, most of them probably aren't. I've went to a red roof in once when I passed through St. Louis, which, you know, that was my fault because parts of St. Louis are literally the most crime-ridden in America. And this is with my ex-wife. And we were driving through, we rolled in at like three in the morning, there was some baseball shit going on, so it was impossible to get a hotel anywhere, but it was already like really, really late. So we needed to stop. And we got in and the lobby actually looked like an old, like a really nice cabin. Like wood, there was two floors, a second floor, was like this nice wood kind of going around. I think there was like antlers in the shed or something. It was like face that like wood laminate, like wood paneling. Like David Lynch. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There was some, yeah, exactly. And then when we went in, it was all empty, except for that one guy sitting at the desk, which was also, now that you mentioned David Lynch, the whole thing was David Lynch. He's sitting there. He was watching something on the screen and wasn't really paying attention when I came up. It's like, oh yeah, you can get the room, whatever. And I borrowed his pen to sign something. Anyways, on our way up to our room room, we had to leave that main hall and then go up to our room. There was a mattress up against the emergency exit. That was already kind of bizarre. And then there was a couple of people in that area just kind of smoking cigarettes and talking. They definitely looked really shady. Then we got into our room and when we closed the door, like only when you closed the door, there's a fucking bullet hole. Not on the outside of the door. On the inside. But only on the inside, which I guess they're good doors. They did penetrate the doors. But someone was clearly on the inside shooting out or something. Anyways, it was like right through like the little map. There's like a little map of like where all the exits and shit were. There was that. And then there was something about like, you know, your own safety and make sure you lock your doors between whatever. So it's really late. It's really creepy. My ex-wife's freaking out. She does not want to be there. But you know, it's late and we got to sleep. Get ready to go to bed. And the phone rings. Last thing I fucking expect. Like, you know, we've been staying in motels for a month. I mean, we've been traveling across the country. It's three in the morning. You just don't expect that once you get to your room. The phone to phone? The phone rang. Inside your motel room. Correct. Yeah, that's fucking weird. Oh yeah, the other thing to mention is, you know, sometimes they have those doors that connect two rooms together. Oh yeah, no, that's no good. So, no, no, no. We had one of those doors, but the one on our side didn't lock. Like it was like pulled out of the socket. Like you can see like the whole, like where it would be. I don't know if the other one was locked cause we never tested it. Yeah. But we like put some of our like luggage and stuff against it just in case it was just like, it was just, the whole thing was just like weird. So anyways, it's the guy from the front desk. And he's like, yeah, I have from the front desk, and you have my pen. Oh my God, I was gonna say that's like the, that was like the instigating incident of the whole. It was a nice pen? No! It was a fucking fucking big pen. It was just like a normal fucking pen. And my first reaction was like, I was so tired and I was really like, I was literally just going to sleep. I'm gonna need that pen. Yeah, I was like, I mean, okay. Do you, I mean, the front desk, I mean, I'll tell you, this lobby was huge. The guy's desk was huge. It was like, you don't have another pen? Like you didn't have a pen. Like roof one on that desk. Yeah, there was something really fucking creepy about the whole thing. So I was like, okay, do you really need it? I mean, I could bring it down to you, or you know, if you need to come get it. And he's like, I'd appreciate it if you could bring it to me. And I was like, God, man. I was just about to write something. Yeah, and apparently there's not a single writing utensil in the entire fucking whatever. So at that point, I mean, I could build this up and say like, oh, it was super creepy or whatever. The people were still outside smoking. Yes, it was a creepy hotel. And I didn't get robbed obviously. Nothing crazy happened. Just the whole thing was very David Lynch. And then like when I brought it to him, I wasn't like, oh, hey, thanks, man. He was just like, yeah, put it there. I was like, okay. That was like you got disciplined. Yeah, and then he felt like it was a weird power play. Yeah. You know, like this guy is a dead end job. He's working behind the desk at a fucking red roof in St. Louis, like bad East St. Louis or whatever. And he just needed to fuck with somebody before he went to, you know, before his shift was over. And I have no fucking idea. Everything in its place. I can tell you guys about the sound.

  South Korean hotels. Yeah. Weird thing about them is, you know, I was over there.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:39.287 --> 0:15:39.372]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:40.148 --> 0:15:41.211]: 
  This is...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:41.987 --> 0:15:48.450]: 
  three or four years ago, but it was still like super out of date. You know, and it's routed to the TV, like you put the TV on a particular channel and mirrors what's

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:42.814 --> 0:15:43.152]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:48.450 --> 0:15:52.939]: 
  on your computer screen and it has a really terrible fucking media player but it before

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:52.939 --> 0:16:02.997]: 
  The only thing is, this is the on demand service in South Korea. They don't have like, you don't pick a movie and pay for it. It's a folder on your desktop with bootleg movies in it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:58.795 --> 0:16:00.499]: 
  Take a movie and pay for it. It's a full movie.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:03.959 --> 0:16:07.452]: 
  I was over there rise of the play of the ace of the theaters over here

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:07.452 --> 0:16:42.974]: 
  Over there it was a video file in this fucking folder, and I just put it on and I'm like, this isn't so bad How was the quality? It was good, perfect. I don't even know how they got it I'm like what is going on here? They have that. Did it have like a weird thumbnail or something? Like did they- No, it was just like an AVI file. Yeah, you know, it's weird media fucking player software You look at the credits of those things, you know, they hire like fucking 5,000 Korean animators to like do that grunt work Yeah, you know one of those guys just like, you know I could just render this fucking shit out. Why not? Yeah, they're paying me five cents to the hour I'll make a couple bucks on this

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:13.493 --> 0:16:15.940]: 
  That was the quality. It was good, perfect.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:15.940 --> 0:16:17.459]: 
  I don't even know how they got it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:17.577 --> 0:16:18.994]: 
  What is going on here there, Dad?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:21.492 --> 0:16:24.344]: 
  No. It was just like an AVI file. Yeah. You know, it's.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:33.068 --> 0:16:34.266]: 
  Yeah. You know one of those.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:35.397 --> 0:16:35.835]: 
  You know?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:38.586 --> 0:16:39.362]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:42.299 --> 0:16:45.977]: 
  Yeah, they were deal with them some some kind of you said they hit

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:45.404 --> 0:17:01.182]: 
  You said they worry about fan death though, right? You were telling a story about Korea before about fan death, so in these hotels, are you allowed to run a fan or do they cut that shit off too? What kills you with the fan death? It's not a... well, this is your solo. You swing too hard from your noose.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:57.419 --> 0:16:59.714]: 
  It's not a... well, this is a solo.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:00.962 --> 0:17:05.114]: 
  Well, if you want me to describe FANDAT to the audience, it's the belief, the crea-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:05.114 --> 0:17:08.944]: 
  I had some belief that rotating like rotary fans will

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:08.944 --> 0:17:23.743]: 
  There's two possibilities of being killed by a fan of the night. It's either it'll suck the oxygen out of the, somehow lower the amount of oxygen in the air where you'll suffocate and die, or it'll make the temperature in the room drop dramatically where you'll freeze to death and die.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:23.980 --> 0:17:31.506]: 
  all because of a little fan. So, it's like multiple, multiple outcomes where you die because of a fan.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:27.304 --> 0:17:29.835]: 
  multiple outcomes where you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:31.118 --> 0:17:40.534]: 
  So South Korean manufacturers are forced to put a timer on their fans to turn them off. Like they can't, they just won't run at night or something because too many Koreans are afraid they'll be killed.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:40.686 --> 0:17:42.998]: 
  I'm like, I'm, I'm arguing with it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:42.998 --> 0:17:51.267]: 
  nice Korean girl over there about this and I'm just like I'm like I sleep with a fucking fan on next to my head every day just like the white noise and

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:50.777 --> 0:17:53.899]: 
  She's like, I'm experiencing a lot of white noise right now. She's like, you don't understand.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:54.945 --> 0:18:28.999]: 
  Yeah, basically, you don't understand, it happens. I'm like, who dies? Yeah. You know, well, there's a lot of them, but he elderly people die in their sleep. I'm like, maybe they just die because they're old. Yeah, yeah. Not the fan. That's who it did it. It should be like name one person you know who died from fan death. Oh my God. They're going up to them. Nate, you know what? You're gonna put this shit, like make manufacturers set this to their code. Tell me five people that you know who died from fan death before you fucking install this system into every hotel, everywhere. But to get back to you, yes, they did have fans in the room, but they weren't.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:05.813 --> 0:18:05.948]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:11.770 --> 0:18:13.694]: 
  They are the good guys!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:28.999 --> 0:18:41.436]: 
  There were very like these weird high-tech fans of the ceiling. It wasn't even like a fan like a ceiling fan It was like this weird how do you describe this little event that kind of lowers out of the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:39.900 --> 0:18:45.874]: 
  Oh yeah, with the fat in it. Lower's out of the ceiling and you have to give it a timer as you have to set it to blow

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:42.870 --> 0:18:43.022]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:45.874 --> 0:18:49.182]: 
  cold air for a certain amount of time, then it'll just shut again. It's really weird.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:49.182 --> 0:20:25.943]: 
  Those slides back Tracks those fuckers over there don't believe in air conditioning They just love humidity and hotness and it's that on top of lots of garlic in their food and smoking cigarettes It's got to be the beautiful smelling blaze if you like your airports and malls and everywhere else not air-conditioned in the Hottest summer ever then you know by all means I you'll love it couldn't I couldn't yeah I like I like just to be damp all the time Yeah, you just run like a red cup up the crease in my back Two ounces of sweat They don't have sweat glands. I don't think are they evolved to not sweat That's the question though is like when you like you're sitting there sweating You know like crazy when you see them are their shirts like sticking to their bodies Actually, yeah, that's I went to I went to Indonesia and I don't have any like I don't have any clothes that you would wear in a really hot situation I only got like pants and shirts and shit and I know obviously Indonesia's fucking real hot and wet Yeah, but I was like, you know, that's no big deal. That's the kind of place It is I'll just buy those clothes when I get there Yeah, but then like first of all all the sizes are wrong as hell That's true even an extra large shirt has like a real tiny armholes and neck holes So I look like I've got like yeah, I still have it still doesn't fit and then also Everyone's walking around like in full suits. Yeah, and they don't even give a shit like it's not a big deal No, it's too hot. I don't know how it happens. See it's so weird because I definitely seen that but when I lived in Malaysia That wasn't the case people swear like motherfuckers out there and don't wear deodorant Maybe they maybe they are actually really uncomfortable and they're just not letting on they're just really good Like they're just so used to it. Yeah at this point my brother was like you come over it's good

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:50.650 --> 0:18:51.274]: 
  Yeah, it's like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:15.810 --> 0:19:16.148]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:34.101 --> 0:21:35.856]: 
  Like fucking

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:36.497 --> 0:29:31.495]: 
  Every fucking day is more human than ever like the most human day of the year over here. Yeah, I don't even understand I don't think they're just close to the equator or what but are they they have no fans fuck that place man Yeah, you're not gonna need those those will fucking kill you Fuck them their fucker hole in the floor toilets. Oh, yeah, you like to put the poo on the floor. Yeah, no toilet I know I don't mind I don't mind those toilets honestly It's supposed to be good for you except for the toilets in the hotel They were normal, but they had 18 electronic buttons on them with all Korean letters on them I don't know what they did just supposed to watch like asshole I'm like you're afraid you're gonna push your buttons gonna blast it right back up into your I can't understand if it was a bidet like oh this one button shoots water. He wasn't it's like no It was like a regular toilet, but had a like a Star Trek Pat like a Star Trek panel on the side of it I like and I look 18 settings like what could this do you look in the bowl and you see like the one little spout That shoots the water and beside that. There's like a silicone finger Beside that why would you why would you possibly need that many but I don't know Just flushed it flushed it flushed normally, but how many things can you possibly do in that toilet? I wish I started hitting buttons, but I'm gonna make a list you know we could make a list honestly But like even though I don't think we hit 18 different things that Commonly would need to be programmed into your toilet. I want to go to pee poo dirty diarrhea puke Yet you you could jizz in it you could come on and then that's fine. We're only Yeah, no, it's literally you know a real one would be I ran out of toilet paper I had to use paper towels, so I have the paper towel this is like others like a super carburetor in there Yeah, or like a like a food yeah, or whatever you know, fuck maybe I use the Canadian I mean what else fucking decomposing like you know get rid of a body. Yo, this is I you guys know flush a rat Do you guys have like chronic tacos? Do you know that place? I might be getting racy here? Let's just fucking do it. It's crazy. It's crazy. So yeah, cuz this is about toilets. So This wasn't even that was like maybe a year and a half two years ago I just called up my buddy Mike and I'm like it was a Saturday Afternoon and I was like you want to go down to chronic tacos and just get some beers and Mexican food And it's like they have them on the West Coast, so I don't people probably know what they are But it's just a Mexican fast food place. That's pretty much it except it's got a salsa bar. They don't have a salsa bar No, it's not that fancy. It's not that authentic, but they have a bar bar, right? So we were just getting you know, we go in and there's just normal kids We're in the uniforms working behind the counter like almost like a Mexican subway. Yeah, they put the guy with a bar Yeah, and so then we got some dos aches or some like just so we can pretend like we're having real Mexican food I'm not gonna lie I initially was really turned off by the idea that it didn't have a salsa bar, but the fact that has a bar Yeah, which was better. It's like it used to be this particular one used to be different It used to have like really sketchy people working there So it was open really late and it was kind of an all-right place to go just to get late drinks and have food around weird people But it got taken now. It's like they play UFC and stuff on the monitors and it closes early Yeah, well, it's just what the closing early doesn't really that that seems like the more pertinent They got all these candy skulls and teenagers and uniforms working painted on the walls Not the teenagers the skulls. Yeah, and then it's like they're playing UFC and they close it like 10. What's the fucking point? I don't get I don't get what the shtick is But we we went we went and we were like this is all right Like we're just gonna do this for a little bit So we had a couple beers each and it was right at that point where it's like Maybe we won't have another beer. Maybe we will and suddenly I got a shit real bad So I was like if we're gonna stay any longer. I gotta get comfortable So I went to the washrooms and the washrooms were like the kind where there's not stalls It's like you close the door and you're in there by yourself. Oh, yeah, like the whole you get the whole room Yeah, very luxurious which which in most cases is I actually prefer Because of the privacy. However in any place where it's like really busy. I hate it Yeah, because immediately when I know that I'm the only one in there before I before my astrochieft even touched the toilet I know someone's gonna be knocking on that door and you assume all blame for everything That is exactly is when you come out of that door or whatever's you inherit every you inherit every splatter Yeah, you know, yeah, and so I actually I thought of this because the other day at the new grand's office I went in the washroom and already smelled like poo And then I was I was only in there to like get a paper towel or something And then someone was outside waiting when I left and then I was like now they think that was yeah, that was not me Motherfucker, that was not me. So I went I went to the washroom and I uh, you know, I I dropped a real a real deuce I'll I'll be frank and uh, everything was cool It was all going according to plan and I flushed the toilet and then it started It was started to go down But then none of the actual stuff that I put in it went down and it stopped and then it started coming back up And the water started rising with like it's like a stew of everything I put in the toilet swirling around And then the water was coming up creeping up slow creeping up slow just where it gets to like the edge You know the the toilet bowl has that square edge that the the seat sits on and it started to rise up past that And I had like a half inch of clearance and I was like fuck fuck fuck fuck stop stop stop and it stopped It slowed it stopped and I was like christ and everything's still swirling real slow Like just just going and it was like and it's all because of the toilet all the torsion It's all like it's all turned cloudy and and the toilet paper is shredded up But it's still in like damp clumps and it's just doing this It's just doing this. It's just doing these Slow evil laps everything more terrifying and so I was like This is real fucked up because now I have to go back out there In this single room thing and I've just been sitting here for a while and it's not like there's very many people There was like maybe six other people in the whole place tops And I was like this I I can't I just can't I can't have my image tarnished by the by the so In my idiot brain on on having a couple beers. I was like, I'm gonna wait until this goes back down a bit I'm gonna try again. Oh, wow. And so did it actually when it was going down Slowly it was going back down slowly. So in my head I was like, maybe there's not that big a problem You know, like maybe this will just clear itself naturally Maybe I can just help it along before anyone has to see this fucking disgrace So I uh, I waited till it it went down a bit and then I was like I've been in here for like 10 minutes if I wasn't noticed as the guy using up the washer before now like Right. Yeah, so like I was I just I was like it's been too long. I just have to I just have to hail mary Yeah, and I flushed it and it started doing the same thing again Unchanged except now I had no clearance. So you just left so no So the the water like there was no room for it to go this time So it all just started like it got to the top of the lid and all the contents were like bumping against the side of the seat As the water was just flowing over the sides Like and there was no drain in the floor It was tiles, but they hadn't put a drain in and the floor was just flat no drain So it was like going I had it was like stepping back trying not to get on my shoes They always expected to be like a public pool. I think most people I don't know fucking drain in my in my bathroom. We just yeah You don't you don't have like we're gonna fucking shit all over their floor You don't have dozens of assholes coming over to your place drinking beers and eating mexican food either So maybe that would be something I don't know this weekend. We kind of did. Yeah, that's a good point Did you feel like you could use the drain? We did actually have a clog on the second floor. Yeah ironically well there you go So the water is going through like all the tiles and it's creeping and it starts going outside the door No, it isn't no one is it because it's not a very big room and the water it like it starts slowly like slowly But surely there's that extra like half inch of space under the door and I was like this is so fucking whack I we have to leave right now Like we have to leave now it was the kind of place where you pay up front Yeah, so we could just go right yeah, so I opened the door cracked to look to see what the situation was to make sure I had the clearance to just fucking be lining out and I saw my friend at the bar Okay, he had just like just as I opened the door and looked the bartender was putting down another drink right in front of him And I was like we are so fucking hooped like I don't know how like I don't know how we're gonna get out of this I was glad there wasn't some like chick waiting to use the bathroom because her nose was like busy And she you just stared her right in the eyes and had to slam the door in her face.

  I don't know, this weekend we kinda did. Yeah, that's a good point.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:40.785 --> 0:28:41.444]: 
  Because this...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:41.444 --> 0:28:42.456]: 
  They'd actually have a call on that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:43.114 --> 0:28:43.941]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:43.941 --> 0:28:44.363]: 
  Well

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:49.476 --> 0:28:49.949]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:49.949 --> 0:28:51.062]: 
  No one is in.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:03.094 --> 0:29:03.449]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:03.449 --> 0:29:03.685]: 
  So be careful.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:08.410 --> 0:29:08.747]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:09.844 --> 0:29:11.937]: 
  And I saw my friend at the bar. Oh, OK.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:20.003 --> 0:29:22.197]: 
  Like I don't know how we're gonna get out of this without me.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:25.099 --> 0:29:25.994]: 
  Yeah, I was like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:31.495 --> 0:29:35.629]: 
  about this. If you could use more. There is more. Yeah. Okay, so let me out.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:33.300 --> 0:30:22.559]: 
  There is more, yeah. Okay, so, but bookmark that shit. Sorry. No, so this is like the men's washroom, and then there's the women's washroom. So luckily in that case, it was all right, but only by a hair, like this was still heinous. So I looked at my friends getting a drink, and I knew I had to stay, like I couldn't possibly be like, dude, I overfilled the toilet with this awful shit approach. And now it's like, we can't stay here, we can't tell them what I did, and they just stay and keep thinking. So I was like, but I have to get in front of this, I have to get ahead of this. Yeah. So I went to the bar, I assessed that the bartender was also kind of running the show. So he was the guy to talk to, so I went up all like, hey man, listen, you know, like I hate to be that guy, because you probably already are on top of this, but I just want to make sure, like there's something going on in the washroom, like something that happened, I don't want to say anything too loud.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:58.984 --> 0:29:59.727]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:03.777 --> 0:30:04.452]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:04.452 --> 0:30:04.941]: 
  So I went.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:10.493 --> 0:30:10.915]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:24.010 --> 0:31:58.324]: 
  I don't want to say, he was like, well, what is it? And I was like, I don't want to say anything like other people are going to hear. I don't want it to sound bad for you. But just so you know, it's with the toilet and there's some stuff. And he was like, oh, is it like overflowing? Like, is there a mess? And I was like, yeah, look, it's cool. I don't know. I don't care. But it's just, it's bad. I just thought you should know. I just want to make sure you. It's real bad. Yeah. It's real bad. And so then those poor kids who he was. You know, there's movies that are like bad, you know, but there's still something kind of redeeming. And then there's movies that are just, they make you angry. Yeah. You're really mad that you watched it. That's just a little bit ready. Just be ready. Yeah, I don't know who would have done some. This isn't like somebody dropped a turd in the middle of the floor and someone's got to pick it up. No, this is this is your shit water flowing around the hall. This is toxic. This is a biohazard. So he was like, oh, you got to. Yeah, you got to love when people just come in here and mess up the washrooms and leave. And I was like, yeah. Yeah. And so then, you know, he got those poor kids who made the burritos to take care of it. And then I'm sitting there still drinking beer. I just got another beer at that point. And then they're joking. Making your burritos are the same guys mopping up poo. That's a questionable strategy. But then later, I was like, I asked my friend. I told my friend, I was like, yeah, that was fucking totally mean. Why don't you go up to the kitchen? You're like, listen, I'm red minus and my shit's on the floor in there. You can have some. You can have some. It's free. I don't normally do this, but you can have it. This is special. It's a gift from me. I'll even take a selfie with you in front of the door. Yeah, we can do it. We can have one of those one of those old MySpace picks of the girl taking the selfie with the full toilet in the background. And then yeah, it's fine.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:46.352 --> 0:30:46.707]: 
  And so that's it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:47.939 --> 0:30:48.310]: 
  He's strong.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:55.870 --> 0:30:56.359]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:59.245 --> 0:31:00.949]: 
  Just be ready. Just be ready.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:02.654 --> 0:31:03.177]: 
  This isn't like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:09.302 --> 0:31:09.994]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:09.994 --> 0:31:11.884]: 
  This is toxic. This is a biohazard.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:19.275 --> 0:31:19.664]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:26.194 --> 0:31:27.510]: 
  And then there's making your

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:29.603 --> 0:31:30.632]: 
  That's a questionable thing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:35.577 --> 0:31:36.319]: 
  What a shot.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:37.939 --> 0:31:39.492]: 
  I'm red minus and my shit's a-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:43.407 --> 0:31:45.600]: 
  I don't normally do this, but you can have it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:46.900 --> 0:31:47.946]: 
  I don't even know it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:49.448 --> 0:31:50.140]: 
  Yeah, we can do it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:59.050 --> 0:32:21.139]: 
  That can be us, we can redo that 2014. So that was, so then, but you gotta wait, you gotta wait with it. We gotta wait with it, we sang. In fact, you came off as a hero. Or not a hero, but a good Samaritan. Yeah, a nice guy who's just having a couple beers and not destroying the restaurant. When in fact you were a shit-mongering mess. Shit-mongering. Yeah, I monged. You mongered that shit. You mongered that shit. What do you got, sorry?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:07.319 --> 0:32:08.078]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:42.233 --> 0:32:51.008]: 
  People start using like the thick paper towels to flush them down the toilet. It gets clogged. I think exactly what you were describing was occurring.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:50.046 --> 0:33:00.998]: 
  Yeah, yeah, for anyone who doesn't know the washroom setup is identical to what I described right? It's just a room with a toilet a flat floor no drain right so holy shit. This is happening to us

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:56.695 --> 0:32:57.539]:

  There's a fan that listened to us and he set his boxes of stuff in the past. Okay. And he was there at Pico Day. Awesome. And his username just happened to be TheJanitor. Oh. And he's a janitor. He's an artist, but he's also a janitor. And he's a really nice guy. And I met him, he's a cool guy, and he went in there and he fixed the toilet because he's like, yeah, I do this all day apparently, and he unclogged it. Wow. I think he re- He's a real American hero. I don't know. I think he reached it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:32.318 --> 0:33:32.858]: 
  It's an artist.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:43.742 --> 0:33:55.065]: 
  Wow, I think you read it's a real man and a hero reached into it and pull and unclogged it Yeah, cuz he's used to doing terrible things all day It is interesting you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:49.142 --> 0:33:49.210]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:52.399 --> 0:37:35.504]: 
  Um, it is interesting to me. It's not like I've ever been in a scenario where I didn't have to use, like a paper towel. Like, sometimes that's what you do. Yeah, everyone's experienced that. I feel like you either really gotta just be a sociopath or, you know what I mean? Just like, you wipe your butt with a whole fucking paper towel, throw it in there and flush it. Excuse the whole newspaper. Yeah, you might, I mean, yeah, just take a pillow. Just fucking take somebody else's fucking, yeah, their pillow, wipe it on your butt and then throw it in the toilet, flush it. It's like, come on, man, what's happening here? When I was a kid, in my, in the house I lived, uh, like, I guess when I was like a teenager, like in high school, we lived in this house for a bit that we were just running. And, uh, the ground level washroom, at some point I was using the toilet at night, and you know that little springy thing that keeps the toilet paper in place? I was changing the toilet paper roll and that shit bounced out and I couldn't find it. Like, I couldn't find it over the whole room. It was like two in the morning and I was like looking like, where the fuck could it go? It was like the Ben Stiller come shot and something about it. It's exactly, yeah, it's 100%. And so like, I, I eventually just gave up and I was like, I guess it's just gone. And it became clear, like, within the coming weeks that it had, it had must have gone down the toilet because like we have these problems where like sometimes it would flush okay. And then sometimes for a period of a couple of days, it would be real backed up and you'd have like all these problems with it. And it was basically fine. We lived there for another year and a half, probably. And then the owner sold the place and, uh, we found out that within like, like a couple of weeks of them taking ownership, the pipes blew up. And they found like, yeah, they did find like somehow we found out about it and that it would, they knew that it was like this debris that was, yeah. So I wonder how careful people, I always wonder how many people like, you know, houses have these histories. And I always wonder like, what are some of the weirdest things people find in these houses they buy? You know what I mean? Like a pipe bursts, they open up a wall to fix the pipe and there's like the fucking skeleton of three children or something in the wall, you know, you know, that's gotta happen. That's, that's, yeah, absolutely happened. Yeah, there's no way it hasn't really just statistically. I mean, but, and then digging, you know, for a foundation for something, you know, somebody's buried somebody or something in the backyard they weren't supposed to. And like common stuff, like there's a wasp's nest that's in the wall and stuff like that. When you just, you know, go do a standard repair and you find like some fucking aggressive insects. But I'm talking weird. I'm talking like a bag of money. A bag of money. I don't know something like a wasp nest seems actually pretty common. I mean, at least it seems, it seems within the realm of reason. Seems like on the internet people are always finding kids safe but they're always empty. I've heard, I've heard of people like finding money. I've actually heard of that. Okay. Well, there's that one show, what is it? The pond, not the pond, the, there's like, these reality shows have like gotten so desperate to like, like, you know what I mean? Like in terms of like the topics that they cover, like it's not even about extreme houses anymore. It's like storage spaces. That's it. They, they have auctions for storage. Storage wars? Yeah, yeah. I don't know if that's what it was. Okay. But these guys find several things almost every episode. They find a safe. Yeah. They find a gun. And oftentimes just a lot of other garbage, but the gun is really important because they have a gun guy and it's, it's supposed to be like a surprise every episode. They're like, look what we found and they're like, you'll never believe it. But then they actually have a guy who like, you know, he appraises guns, he fixes guns, he shoots guns and then half the episode is them like blowing up watermelons with shit they find in this storage unit. Yeah. But it's all supposed to be just about the storage unit. But I haven't, yeah, I'm just curious, like, you fucking go into some storage unit and they auction it off and you open up a refrigerator and there's just like a fucking rat king in there. You know, just like, just hanging out. Just roiling. Yeah. Like a big Jell-O blob. That's what I hate about those fucking shows.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:00.854 --> 0:34:02.389]: 
  Yeah, everyone's experienced that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:12.649 --> 0:34:13.949]: 
  I mean, excuse the whole news

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:13.949 --> 0:34:14.960]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:15.164 --> 0:34:20.445]: 
  I mean, yeah, just take a pillow Just fucking take somebody else's fucking, yeah, their pillow

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:16.007 --> 0:34:16.851]: 
  Take a pillow.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:26.335 --> 0:34:26.639]: 
  here.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:48.087 --> 0:34:49.724]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:46.845 --> 0:35:47.892]: 
  You know that's gotta happen.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:47.892 --> 0:35:49.917]: 
  That's yeah, absolutely happened

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:51.115 --> 0:35:51.317]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:51.942 --> 0:35:51.959]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:35.504 --> 0:37:38.440]: 
  I just they minimize the most interesting aspects

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:38.440 --> 0:37:46.911]: 
  like oh here's the history of this object instead it's like oh we found a crossbow let's go shoot it for 20 of the minutes of the episode

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:43.452 --> 0:37:48.919]: 
  for 20 minutes of the episode. It's true. And we're shooting various objects in a field.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:48.514 --> 0:38:50.648]: 
  And then they do it in slow-mo. They tease it before the commercials too. Yeah. You won't believe what we do with this crossbow. You come back. Yeah, okay. Yeah, actually I would have figured that one out. I didn't need to see it. I don't know. I think the future of television is a lot like, I don't know, the internet too where you can like specify things so minutely. You know, like if you have a fetish, like let's say it's literally getting smacked in your left eye with, you know, a three-day old fish. Something really specific, something really weird. There's hundreds of people out there who are probably like absolutely on board. So what were they showing downstairs? There's something like Korean girl on YouTube who was like shoveling ketchup. Was she just eating? No, she was shoveling. She was in a bathtub full of ketchup and she was shoveling. She had a shovel and was shoveling it onto a huge like garbage pail of fries. And she was like rubbing it on her face and like, I don't know, it was so weird. It's really good. I like when they put them to work.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:53.475 --> 0:37:55.990]: 
  Yeah. You won't believe it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:55.129 --> 0:37:56.277]: 
  You won't believe what we're saying.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:59.584 --> 0:38:03.162]: 
  Yeah, but actually I would have been. Yeah, no, you figured that one out. Yeah, I didn't need to see it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:33.216 --> 0:38:33.959]: 
  religious eating

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:52.133 --> 0:40:04.999]: 
  There's definitely every no my favorite somebody somebody listening to this knows what I'm talking about She's got like over a hundred thousand subscribers, and she like makes out with her Korean boyfriend. Well, she speaks Korean pretty much primarily There's a video where she's it's from the POV of somebody chasing her And she's just running down a tunnel like she's like in a big freeway tunnel But like really poorly like she clearly doesn't know how to run and she's really running away And so she's like looking behind her but it's like really awkward and she keeps falling down really awkwardly like not really falling like You know She's like screaming like no no scared the whole time and like eventually like she like hits the ground She doesn't even try to get up. She's gonna like rolls around like in agony or something like that I don't know. It's like the perfect video. It's like the POV rape scene video like oh, I really needed that I'm chasing some Asian girl down a tunnel video. I like yeah I haven't heard of that, but I bet you could just search like Korean broad shoveling catch up And you do be the first yeah broad you can choose the word That's the that's the medically correct term, but you can use a tunnel tunnel chase rape POV I'm sure she shows up to it's less interesting

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:53.331 --> 0:38:54.158]: 
  No, my favorite.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:17.479 --> 0:39:19.487]: 
  and she's not really running away.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:27.334 --> 0:39:29.663]: 
  Yeah, yeah, but don't catch her.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:30.777 --> 0:39:31.435]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:55.009 --> 0:39:55.414]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:57.270 --> 0:39:57.557]: 
  That's the

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:59.160 --> 0:40:00.156]: 
  You can use tunnel.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:04.999 --> 0:40:18.179]: 
  but I, I'm the same vein, I was funny, weird how, anytime I wanna find a random scene from any movie almost ever made, I just type it in and it's somebody isolated that clip and put it on YouTube and like, who are these people doing this? Yeah, it's like,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:18.179 --> 0:40:21.081]: 
  Thanks.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:18.938 --> 0:40:26.329]: 
  What's up? But thanks. But thanks, yeah, thank you. Thank you for that. But I just like almost anything you can look for, any scene, it's just there.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:25.890 --> 0:40:47.440]: 
  You know, I don't know if I appreciate it or if I am annoyed by it, but sometimes when people find those scenes and they upload it and it clearly has the worst quality ever. And like it's almost inaudible. Like they're doing it off of their television or like off of their laptop. Like they like use their phone to record their something else. And it's just like, why did you even upload this? Or they take an action scene and they put Nick in it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:34.429 --> 0:40:37.028]: 
  Yeah. And like it's almost inaudible. Like they're doing it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:47.440 --> 0:41:03.944]: 
  back I was like I'm like I want to look up this one scene from Battlestar Galaxia because I haven't seen it in a few years it's fucking spaceships fighting over nickel back oh yeah it's just like find this guy and kill him or just a Lincoln I was gonna say every anime

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:58.071 --> 0:40:58.560]: 
  Oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:01.007 --> 0:41:18.186]:

  I hate you so much dad

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:15.486 --> 0:41:24.666]: 
  some of the best. Some of the best. Why hasn't an anime company picked up on this? They're like, let's get Lincoln Park to actually score this anime movie. You know, dude, if Lincoln Park scores,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:22.135 --> 0:42:02.905]: 
  Score it dude if Lincoln Park scored like the next Sonic series, which was a little edgier than Sonic boom Yeah kids would just they would literally explode like a spontaneously They just do kids now do kids now still is Lincoln Park still a thing or is that like yeah I don't know like when you look up the video and it's always Lincoln Park, but the date on the upload is like 2007 Yeah, yeah, I don't know what they listen to now. What are kids listening to now? I don't know like even they're not even listening to squirrel X anymore. Even that's like whatever girl grandpa. Yeah, that's played Yeah, I don't know what whatever is new. It's so it's so interesting. Whatever they we don't know on grown-up cast no 2016 yeah, we're all we're all fucking no babies allowed

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:33.947 --> 0:41:34.960]: 
  Do kids now?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:34.200 --> 0:41:34.437]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:38.250 --> 0:41:39.060]: 
  Yeah, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:43.583 --> 0:41:44.444]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:44.444 --> 0:41:44.680]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:53.387 --> 0:41:53.826]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:57.893 --> 0:41:58.416]: 
  We don't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:00.492 --> 0:42:09.267]: 
  Yeah, we're all we're all fucking no babies allowed his dead mouth still thing Know I saw there's a guy named Mark

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:05.588 --> 0:42:14.768]: 
  I don't know. I saw there's a guy named Marshmallow. Marshmallow? Yeah, he wears like a marshmallow in his head. He actually looks like a snail. He's running out of names, I guess.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:12.895 --> 0:42:22.446]: 
  He actually has some names I guess. What are these awkward dweebs listen to? These incomplete little humans. What are they listen to you make? They should make a playlist for us. I want to know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:21.197 --> 0:42:34.056]: 
  I want to know. What's filling the void? I want to be in the know. I don't know, maybe it's regressing. Maybe it's going back. Going back to my chemical romance. Everyone's gone back. Evanescence. It's a black parade all over again.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:22.446 --> 0:42:22.463]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:23.324 --> 0:42:24.201]: 
  I wanna be, yeah, I wanna be

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:24.944 --> 0:42:26.952]: 
  I don't know, maybe it's regressing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:32.959 --> 0:42:38.005]: 
  We're going back. We're so infuriating reading articles about this stuff because these marketers are like, you know, kids are so...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:38.005 --> 0:43:17.948]: 
  so cool they there was no they're always into the coolest stuff and I'm like no no no they like so the Millennials are saying these days on clique yeah yeah yeah is that what the guy said oh god Taco Bell's performance this quarter has been on clique oh my god and you know it's not even bad enough you say it once wrong it's the fact that you just keep repeating it's like somebody who says somebody's name wrong they just keep fucking saying it again and again it just the first time you're like ooh and then the next time it just keeps getting it's not like you get used to it it actually just gets worse like the first couple times we could we give you a pass yeah and then eventually you just want to stand up and be like you know what can we just stop the conversation okay I was I was talking to I think I told

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:44.451 --> 0:42:45.734]: 
  is what the millennials are saying.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:46.982 --> 0:42:50.087]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, is that what the guy said? Oh, God.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:09.544 --> 0:43:09.629]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:12.177 --> 0:43:13.122]: 
  to stay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:17.948 --> 0:43:46.905]: 
  read about this but how, yeah, this internet culture. I really feel like I'm so detached from it where, I won't say who told me this but he's working, he works in a very popular company. A very, very successful company. And there's younger millennials working there and they all use internet speak. Like, you know, like when you post a huge story but then you put a little recap at the end and it says like TLDR or whatever. Which is like, I barely even know about this. But they actually say it like a word. Like they'll, they'll

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:46.905 --> 0:44:18.495]: 
  tell a whole thing and then they'll be like, and Tildia, no they don't. Yeah, he doesn't even say that. No, they don't. Yeah, they call it Tildia. No, they don't. That's like a scene from fucking, what's that gay ass fucking show with those guys from the internet, they're supposed to be nerds, but they're not. Oh fuck, big bang theory? Yeah, that thing. God damn. That atrocity. He let out an exasperated sigh and an eye roll and I'm like, he has to be telling the truth. That, I mean, that sounds like something they would do. That bit that Lyle made that little clip that was going around that I think probably everyone has seen at this point where it's just a,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:50.989 --> 0:43:52.491]: 
  Yeah, he said it. Yeah, they

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:52.491 --> 0:43:54.955]: 
  call it tillier. No, they don't.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:00.726 --> 0:44:03.915]: 
  Oh fuck! They're fucking, it's like a word, yeah that thing.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:01.452 --> 0:44:01.502]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:12.184 --> 0:44:12.269]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:20.082 --> 0:45:56.944]: 
  and him screaming at it and it perfectly sums it up. Like I don't know what that fucking show, I replied to that, I was like. Do you know popular, that thing is popular. Yeah, it's very popular. You mean his tweet or the show? No, the show. I think they're neck and neck. Many, many people in the show way. People love it, I'm shocked. Watch that show, they're at work, they're not having the best day, and the one thing going through their mind isn't completing the task in front of them, it's man, I can't wait to get home, kick off my shoes, fucking grab my Chipotle burrito and sit down and fucking pull out my DVR and watch this fucking Big Bang Theory show. Enjoy a little BBT. It's things like this that ruin relationships and families because you have aunts and uncles who are like, I love that show. And I just like, It's a great TV. You know, they're young, the main demographic is younger people. You'd think it was like these out of touch older people that are like, oh, I have a nephew like that. I think it's a lot of both. It's like moms. No, there is, yeah, there is definitely them, but there's a lot of people of that age demographic. Anything with a laugh track just makes me go fucking berserk. Do you know? I don't know how that's still, I don't know why laugh tracks still exist. It was like a relic, like some sort of intermediary between like when shows used to be all stage shows and they didn't know how to adapt it, like what people expected to see as a stage show to TV. So they had laugh tracks for a long time. Curb of enthusiasm doesn't have a laugh track. No, that's why it works. Cause the timing for all the jokes and everything. There's no pauses. That's why all those things like you see friends where they take the laugh track out and stuff. It's awkward because everyone's pausing on naturally and looking at each other right in the face. You think, cause we're in this circle of animators, like we see a lot of off-court.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:22.495 --> 0:44:22.748]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:34.004 --> 0:44:36.704]: 
  People love it and shocked. Watch that show.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:55.350 --> 0:44:56.633]: 
  Enjoy a little BBT.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:03.400 --> 0:45:05.999]: 
  Too far. You know, they're young.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:13.120 --> 0:45:16.427]: 
  It's a lot of both. It's like mom's. No, there is. Yeah. There is definitely...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:40.255 --> 0:45:41.942]: 
  I'm a criminal enthusiasm doesn't have a laughter.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:45.689 --> 0:45:47.410]: 
  There's no pauses.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:53.232 --> 0:45:54.244]: 
  Serv among your own Czech brothers to celebrate SUPER SN pitch the fans to Dadatalk what happensoff the strat

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:55.442 --> 0:45:55.493]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:56.944 --> 0:46:03.897]: 
  filter types of humor that it's sort of, I don't know, like tainted us to, we can't watch this very standard. Of course. Yes, definitely.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:01.129 --> 0:46:14.882]: 
  can't watch this very stinger. Of course. Yes, definitely. I think so, but at the same time, it's like, I don't know, I don't think it's tainted us so much as, you know, it's like people who don't eat a lot of different foods don't necessarily. I don't wanna say our humor's evolved, but it's caught off in this video.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:14.882 --> 0:46:20.181]: 
  separate track. No I do think it's evolved. I think it's not only evolved I think

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:16.097 --> 0:47:46.952]: 
  No, I do think it's evolved. I think it's not only evolved, I think we have a wider palette because we watch a lot of different types of things. Yeah, I really do just watch stuff all day and think about it all day. Most people, like you said, just go to work and they eat the burrito and then enjoy Big Bang Theory. All they know is... Just a nice way, it probably feels nice in the way that being lobotomized would suck, but afterwards you just kind of chill. The idea is not appealing. Yeah, and that isn't to say that there are very well maybe plenty of fucking valuable merits to some of these shows, but from what I've seen, I don't understand. It's the dude... I think lobotomies are probably the closest thing you can come to. No, not to be kind of sending, but literally something that just kind of shuts off your brain. You had a long day, you fucking hate your job, you just want to watch something that you don't even... It just kind of zones you out. You can know Joe, I was telling him one time I really liked his cartoons and stuff. We were talking a bit. This is quite a while back, but he made the point that he said something to the effect of you have to spend a lot of time on the internet in order to get my cartoons. And actually that summed it up the best. No, that is actually a really good assessment. And I think we see those cartoons too, where most of the time, anyway, like I'm in the weird part of the internet or whatever, and we're just looking around like, no, that's just Mark M. We know exactly what this is. Conversely, some animators, they almost go off the rails so far, it's like nobody understands them at all.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:24.079 --> 0:46:25.547]: 
  Yeah, yeah, I really do.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:32.027 --> 0:46:33.732]: 
  All they know is just like a nice way of

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:40.532 --> 0:46:41.325]: 
  the ideas.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:41.950 --> 0:46:42.220]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:56.310 --> 0:46:57.475]: 
  I think a lobotomy is probably the...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:58.251 --> 0:46:59.449]: 
  You just don't know.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:09.895 --> 0:47:10.047]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:23.395 --> 0:47:26.078]: 
  Yeah. And actually, that summed it up the best. No, that is.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:27.850 --> 0:47:29.099]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:38.025 --> 0:47:38.549]: 
  Noah, dude.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:44.657 --> 0:48:04.215]: 
  Nobody understands them. That's true too. Like, all right, I'll just say their names, but I don't care. Like Mark M and like even this guy, no Red Lobster. Not Red Lobster, I suppose that's Red Lobster. Red Lobster? Yeah. Sexual Lobster. They're humor. I love their stuff, but it's gone so far off in this weird tangent direction. It's like only they find it funny anymore.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:53.466 --> 0:47:57.533]: 
  Red Lobster. Yeah. Sexual Lobster. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:04.148 --> 0:48:21.951]: 
  You know, it's, I don't think it's gone all the way there. They dip over to that place. Cause they're clearly, like I still see things from them that I totally absolutely get. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I get a glimpse of- But sometimes, it's not just like it's not funny. It's, they find, it's clearly there, it's clearly what they wanted to make.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:13.514 --> 0:48:14.577]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:21.951 --> 0:48:24.398]: 
  but it's weird. Yeah, it's, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:22.997 --> 0:49:32.640]: 
  Yeah, it's yeah. Yeah, there is a punchline. It's just not for you. Right, right. It wasn't meant for you I don't know who's meant. Yeah, that's the thing. Yeah, it's not clear You know I was working on some collabs and some of them It's like collabs with twitch and twitch users like audience members come in and I do this this collab and I enjoyed the process a lot and looking back It's interesting because when I'm in the chat and we're sitting there talking about these ideas like a half-mer man Rob Schneider, you know like character. It seems to make so much sense Yeah, like in the moment, you know the ideas just keep rolling It's like oh and what if and what if and what if and what if and it's like this is oh my god This is only getting better and then you know everyone's happy at the end of the night We're all high-fiving each other like holy shit. This is gonna be so fun I can't wait to see what this turns out to be we make it even then we're like yeah, yeah No, this turned out great We're really happy without a turn out and then like three days later I go back to like show it to somebody and it's not even their reaction It's just having them in the room while I'm watching it without any context and and I'm the one like yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:29.089 --> 0:48:30.659]: 
  Yeah, that's the thing.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:05.573 --> 0:49:05.961]: 
  is only

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:16.035 --> 0:49:17.318]: 
  We're like, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:34.328 --> 0:51:18.447]: 
  Yeah, you did kind of have that reaction when I was watching. You showed me those three the other day and without, I watched them with no context. I thought that, like, I think I enjoyed them more just watching them with no context. I thought they were funnier with just no, like, just here look at this shit. Like, I guess I wouldn't have known that that half mermaid thing was Rob Schneider. But I don't think, I didn't feel like I needed to. I didn't feel like knowing it was Rob Schneider and made it better or worse, but like, I thought it was funny like that it was two top halves together. Like, what the fuck? That's cause, so, okay, this is, this is, here's a question. But it's like, do you, sorry, just before. Yeah, no, this is a different direction. I am curious. Do you then stick to your guns? Do you, you know, like Mark M or Sexual Lobster or, you know, the guy who did salad fingers or, you know, like David Firth, do you, do you just keep going? You just keep going, you keep going all the way. You don't look back. You don't hesitate. You don't let people catch up. You just fucking go where you wanna go. I think so. I think you should. And I think maybe there's a point in that process of going further and further down your own rabbit hole where maybe you have to stop and evaluate what you're doing for the sake of considering whether it's what you wanna do or whether you're just getting more extreme in a way that's not beneficial to anyone, but I don't think that pushing a concept further or pushing an approach further or being weirder because that's coming naturally should be something you stop doing because you're afraid of alienating people. I think it's better to keep it. He's running to like a John K situation, but even I don't think that was so much like pushing a start. That was just him not having people to like, you know, moderate the insanity.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:41.989 --> 0:49:42.344]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:50.916 --> 0:49:50.950]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:54.645 --> 0:49:55.439]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:55.439 --> 0:49:58.004]: 
  I don't feel like I needed to. I don't feel like no one's gonna be able to do that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:09.597 --> 0:50:10.154]: 
  But it's like,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:10.154 --> 0:50:11.183]: 
  do you sorry just

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:11.183 --> 0:50:11.588]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:26.657 --> 0:50:26.910]: 
  You know

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:50.333 --> 0:50:51.075]: 
  be considering what

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:08.085 --> 0:51:09.452]: 
  He's running to like a John K.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:16.270 --> 0:51:17.839]: 
  Yeah, moderate right the end.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:45.985 --> 0:53:49.056]: 
  Are you planning on staring at it? No, I wouldn't.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:47.807 --> 0:54:18.959]: 
  No, I wouldn't. I'd just flip it around backwards, have it fucking throw a drape over its ass and just glory-holer. You can't cover it? What? I can't cover it. Nobody said I could. I can close my eyes. I guess you can cover it, but you'd still have to. Is it making fish sounds? Yeah, it would be like a rockfish, like with the, like the, like the, like the water. You'd have to have the top of in water. The eyes would be like, oh, otherwise it's just suffocating. That would be a good question. That actually might be more exciting, honestly. Fucking a suffocating half-mer person. You could be giving it a swirly in the toilet at the same time.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:53.460 --> 0:53:57.426]: 
  You can't cover it. I can't cover it. Nobody said I could. I can close my eyes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:53.494 --> 0:53:53.950]: 
  Memorial.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:00.852 --> 0:54:02.505]: 
  Is it making fish sounds?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:02.505 --> 0:54:04.024]: 
  Yeah, it would be like it was like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:07.045 --> 0:54:12.107]: 
  Have the top of in water the eyes would be like otherwise. It's just suffocating a good question

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:16.680 --> 0:54:17.204]: 
  You can be getting

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:20.258 --> 0:55:03.728]: 
  Isn't that a fetish? Yeah, that is. Headed toilet sex? We're headed toilet by flushing at the same time. Yeah, man. I mean, I totally understand where Jeff was coming from. And me. I'm with Jeff on that one. Oh, really? So yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't think it's as cut and dry as you guys are trying to make it sound. But it's not. This was a bear top or bear bottom. Bear? Like, what kind of bear? I don't know. Bear to scale and human to scale? You know it does. Like a normal size bear bottom and a normal size. The human bottom and the bear top. I don't really consider it. You can even scale them down a little bit. No, no. Slightly to the left. Don't even scale it. I honestly, I just want to fuck a bear. I think there's a fucking full blown bear.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:21.878 --> 0:54:23.667]: 
  Yeah, that is. Headed toilet.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:24.494 --> 0:54:24.865]: 
  Thanks.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:33.809 --> 0:54:34.973]: 
  Oh really?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:35.850 --> 0:54:36.947]: 
  I don't know. I don't think it's as-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:37.994 --> 0:54:43.950]: 
  What was the bear top or bear bottom? Bear like? What kind of bear? I don't know a bear.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:49.080 --> 0:54:52.236]: 
  I never really considered it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:54.565 --> 0:54:55.949]: 
  No, no, no!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:55.949 --> 0:54:57.434]: 
  Oh shit, don't even scare me.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:03.728 --> 0:55:05.230]: 
  I believe you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:05.010 --> 0:55:12.165]: 
  That's I I think bare top half of human bottom half is out of the question because of the claws in the yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:11.220 --> 0:55:16.755]: 
  Yeah, you don't want a woman with bear claws. That would be very bad. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:15.996 --> 0:56:10.941]: 
  And also the head of a bear. Depends on the position though. Yeah, so I guess we're, you know, across the board in agreement that you would have to what? Bear bottom, I think that's what I think. Bear bottom? With that little fluffy bear tail sticking out. I don't think I'd want to be staring into a bear's face while I was fucking it. That's right. That's true. That's true. It seems to come with a lot of risk, just by virtue of it being a bear. Well, hold on, hold on. That's all the bag of beans then. I mean, you're saying that like it's a sentient bear. Right, like the bear has a different consciousness. Like it's a bear in the woods running around. It happens to have a woman's like, you know, body, bottom half. Yeah, it would be like a bear maid, I guess. It's Jeff's bear. Oh, I guess technically, whatever the maid, like so like bear maid or mermaid or whatever. It's brain is the top half. Well, that puts things, we assume that, yeah. Right, if it has the head of a bear, it's thinking like a bear. Yeah, well then that's nuts. What about Brody's? Brody's one of Pony's.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:23.286 --> 0:55:23.674]: 
  Voe.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:25.159 --> 0:55:25.227]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:25.227 --> 0:55:26.087]: 
  bare bottom.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:28.045 --> 0:55:29.462]: 
  I don't think I'd want to be seen.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:31.386 --> 0:55:33.614]: 
  That's right. That's true. That's true.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:36.162 --> 0:55:36.668]: 
 おこ、おこ、おこ

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:41.224 --> 0:55:42.507]: 
  Right, like the bears has a different...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:42.507 --> 0:55:43.418]: 
  like it's a big

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:48.649 --> 0:55:49.712]: 
  Yeah, it would be like a bad thing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:04.140 --> 0:56:06.840]: 
  Right? If it has the head of a bear, it's thinking like a bear.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:08.055 --> 0:56:08.410]: 
  What about...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:10.941 --> 0:56:16.088]: 
  Top half or pony bottom half? They want pony all pony. 100% all pony. But it's like an answer from

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:12.359 --> 0:56:21.235]: 
  They want pony all percent all but it's like an anthropomorphized pony already So it's basically just got like two knees. Yeah, yeah, per leg worse

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:19.665 --> 0:56:25.454]: 
  Yeah, yeah, who's worse? Brodies or Furries? Who's committing more atrocities in the world?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:24.998 --> 0:56:49.230]: 
  I find I think I think bronies because furries is a broader category and I talked to some furries I know some people who are furries and at some point with all of them I've been like look is this like a sexual thing or what's the deal? Yeah, it's like a performance thing and most of them Say either it's some intersection of the two or that it's more performance. I'm not gonna lie those suits look really comfortable

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:28.187 --> 0:56:28.221]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:31.140 --> 0:56:31.225]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:38.312 --> 0:56:38.717]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:38.515 --> 0:56:38.869]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:49.230 --> 0:56:53.213]: 
  I'm gonna say bronies are more emotionally damaged and for me they're more sexual deviants.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:54.107 --> 0:57:01.448]: 
  I was gonna totally agree with you, but now I don't know. I mean, I don't know the don't don't don't take their side

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:01.448 --> 0:57:03.692]: 
  Don't even, don't even, just, for a little while.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:03.692 --> 0:57:32.447]: 
  We are we are citing dude like which one are we insulting more at this point? I Mean I think that I would say that freeze at least to a degree The notion of like a full-blown animal rather than like a cartoon character Yeah, and it's not even like a real horse. You know what I mean or a real pony I mean it's like a it's like saying you want to fuck a Disney character if they had a little more variety in the outfits They weren't all like blue dogs and purple wolves and shit

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:19.690 --> 0:57:19.707]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:27.419 --> 0:57:28.161]: 
  a little more variety.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:32.447 --> 0:57:34.945]: 
  shit. Like if they were like a turtle or a

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:34.945 --> 0:57:52.495]: 
  or a fish or something or look like Big Bird or just like an intentionally stupid look at all. He's Big Bird or Furry. It's technically Big Bird or Furry. I think he's too stupid looking to be a furry. I don't know. Like, all these like, don't think too much about it. You gotta be smart, you gotta be sexy to be a furry. Probably, they all wanna be sexy. They wanna be furry and sexy.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:39.417 --> 0:57:40.733]: 
  He's big for the furry.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:42.404 --> 0:57:48.158]: 
  I think he's too stupid looking to be afraid. Like, all these like, don't think too much, man.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:47.922 --> 0:57:48.006]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:49.491 --> 0:57:49.947]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:52.495 --> 0:57:57.237]: 
  sexy. They would have like cute little paws and like they would want to be on like this winking smirking face.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:56.984 --> 0:58:43.002]: 
  It's interesting because I'm curious with like bronies. Is it kind of like with gay people, how you have like a top and a bottom? Or like you have clearly the more kind of feminine type one and the more masculine type one. Yeah. Do you have bronies that want to be ponies and then the bronies that want... Do you have bronies that want to be ponies fucked by people or by other bronie ponies? Or maybe it's gonna be melted from behind. Right. Or do you have you know bronies that just want to mount other ponies? Regular ponies? I'm just saying I feel like there's... I think we've... I'm realizing now that I have kind of clumped them all together and that I've made that you know very poor generalization. In fact there is quite a variety here. Whatever...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:21.520 --> 0:58:23.629]: 
  I want to be melted from behind.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:29.940 --> 0:58:31.054]: 
  I'm just saying, I feel like there's

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:43.002 --> 0:58:47.946]: 
  situation makes them forget being touched by their father or uncle.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:47.710 --> 0:58:54.966]: 
  I was gonna say we need like a proper brony in here to answer some of these questions, but I think Jeff just answered

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:53.127 --> 0:58:54.004]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:54.004 --> 0:58:54.274]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:57.227 --> 0:58:59.202]: 
  That's gonna be wrong, but I'll be right back.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:05.395 --> 0:59:12.179]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:11.014 --> 0:59:42.435]: 
  Well, you know what they're gonna tell you that they have the same argument for all of it It's the cartoons very well animated. That's number one number two. It's amazing that it's a positive message Well, no, I mean, I don't think it's like the best animated show in the world.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:38.348 --> 1:03:41.504]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:47.562 --> 1:04:16.992]: 
  Yeah, because it was like it was supposed to have been purchased by the government. That was infuri- I mean because with the review system you can only drop one review. I can imagine people being infuriated. So many people thought it was- But I mean it switched it back afterwards, right? Yeah, yeah. But we changed even words like if they said like, oh this movie's great. We swapped the word great with something weird and like everybody's a call confused and like, like what do you mean by that? I just love like if you try to respond to a comment like that your response would be equally as ridiculous trying to respond to it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:49.958 --> 1:03:51.089]: 
  That was infuri-

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:57.315 --> 1:03:58.497]:

  you're like the straights in yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:38.674 --> 1:07:54.139]: 
  It was so great. The minute show, it was from the late 80s or something. It was called My Two Dads. Yeah, yeah. And then the whole intro of the show was like the girl explaining why she has two dads. I don't remember that part, please. She was like, why do I have two dads? Here's why, because this happened and this happened. Now they're both my dad. And I think that, like, as a kid, I was like, okay, that's the show opening. But like now, as an adult in hindsight, and it was the 80s, maybe that was to reassure, like, the people of the day that like, no, no, no, this isn't like a gay thing. She just has two dads, calm down. I just remember in that show, one of them was like a weird, kind of salvage-y, fix-it-up kind of guy, and they had a table that was made of like a bike wheel, so it would rotate. Yeah. And I thought that was cool, because I was a kid and I was stupid. You know, the 80s is interesting. The 80s was a time when people really did feel the need to kind of subvert, like, just kind of under the radar, express their gayness. Like, you had people like George Michael. You had, you know, with songs that were very clearly about fucking dudes. You know, at that point, Queen was already quite popular, but there were some women singers that came out too. Right. That were doing their stuff, and there was kind of a gay boom. Yeah, like, in my memory, I kind of think of the 80s as being like super flamboyant, but then when I think about like my two dads, I remember. Yeah, no, it was still-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:43.467 --> 1:06:44.412]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:48.090 --> 1:06:49.980]: 
  I don't remember that part. She was like, why do I have to...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:02.535 --> 1:07:03.818]: 
  The people of the day that like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:05.370 --> 1:07:05.691]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:06.855 --> 1:07:07.007]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:07.007 --> 1:07:07.277]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:15.344 --> 1:07:15.816]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:18.263 --> 1:07:19.714]: 
  You know the 80s is interesting.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:45.989 --> 1:07:46.039]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:52.637 --> 1:08:04.922]: 
  Yeah, no, it was still there was like bosom buddies. Yeah, like perfect strangers perfect The other one was gay bulky was like straight and yeah, the other one was gay. Yeah, but it's

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:56.755 --> 1:08:00.147]: 
  Perfect strangers. That's what I was gonna say. Do you have Dalkey? No, no.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:04.112 --> 1:08:57.167]: 
  Yeah, but it's interesting like you know because nowadays it's like every show's got a gay guy or yeah a couple or something like that But back then you know as flamboyant as we remember it and as many gay things that were happening in terms of like gay pride and And you know singers and songs and all that stuff, you know mainstream media was still very straight like very yeah Yeah, oh yeah, of course and homogenous now. It's like I don't know I feel like they keep adding all these things like that are necessary in order to fill out all the slots You need like you know an African-American you need a gay people you need, you know some kind of Asian ethnicity Man or woman, you know, they're generally a comedic relief in some way You know There's almost like a formula like these you got to have these characters in order to create your show Oh, yeah, all these groups want their be represented. Yeah, but

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:23.399 --> 1:08:25.122]: 
  Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, of course.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:53.742 --> 1:08:54.147]: 
  That's a huge valley here.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:56.609 --> 1:09:01.993]: 
  Yeah, but then you know they get mad if one of theirs is like killed or something on one of these shows. Yeah, I want to say preferably

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:00.779 --> 1:09:01.064]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:01.993 --> 1:09:10.178]: 
  my own argument. I feel like, look controversial statement fellas, I feel like in more TV, you know, white men are always getting each...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:10.178 --> 1:09:21.247]: 
  holes blown in their heads by shotguns and she like, like the new daredevil like, why aren't women getting more shotguns in the face? That's what I'm saying. We were tough. It's only fair. It's only fair. I feel like they-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:17.703 --> 1:09:29.247]: 
  It's only fair. It's only fair. I feel like why aren't they marching for that? You know, why are they picketing Hollywood? I want to shock, you know, women for shock does in the face.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:28.099 --> 1:09:32.048]: 
  I'm pro for women for shock into the face.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:30.899 --> 1:09]: 
  Yeah, there's a lot of mansplaining you two motherfuckers right now Yeah, I don't appreciate yeah, I appreciate man spreading. There's no way time X

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:35.018 --> 1:09:35.946]: 
  Yeah, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09 --> 1:09:43.506]: 
  If you ever say the word like problematic or toxic. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:43.506 --> 1:10:01.157]: 
  Hold on, hold on, hold on. I've used both of those words, but not in the context that were- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, you know. People stole those words. If I'm gonna- Like, cuck. Cuck. Cuck. That's weird. That just sounds like chickens. People just fucking hijacked these words, and no one will ever know the meaning of these words.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:44.332 --> 1:09:45.210]: 
  Hold on, what?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:47.995 --> 1:09:51.167]: 
  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, you know people stole those work

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:51.841 --> 1:09:52.162]: 
  Like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:53.749 --> 1:09:56.854]: 
  weird that was just chickens

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:00.195 --> 1:10:05.950]: 
  these words yeah that that's a very you need to be a very specific type of person for that word to even be used accurately

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:05.697 --> 1:10:23.534]: 
  I would actually be the correct usage, which is why I'm very aware of that word and when people use it I'm not offended It wouldn't because it would have snowed out. You're not because it would it's under the assumption you're cool with that happening

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:05.950 --> 1:10:06.507]: 
  I would have

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:21.897 --> 1:10:24.495]: 
  You're supposed to be in on it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:24.495 --> 1:13:20.265]: 
  But see the original usage of it was not that. The original usage, yeah, the original usage was more of like you're a fool because you don't know what's happening. It's like happening behind you. I assumed it was like, oh, he allows it. No, no. I, as far as I'm concerned, it became that. Well, now it is. Right. I think it became more of like, no, it's the, it's almost like a rape fantasy. It's the opposite. It's the, I'm getting cheated on fantasy. You know what I mean? But I think, but initially the, the usage of it was more of you, you were not aware of what's going on. I was thinking like, is it like people would sell, you know, some people like to make a sex tape of themselves and then watch it for some fucking reason. I guess cause they want to watch the person that they're having sex with. No. But then like, I wonder like maybe, yeah, that does seem weird. But then I was thinking like, maybe the whole thing is like, you want to watch someone else do it cause you then you don't have to see your gross self. Like that's the last fucking thing I want to see. Like, yeah. No, I mean, what was that one? There was that one on the, what's her name? Blank, Mr. and Mrs. Blank or something? I don't know. There's like these weird you porn couples that just like hire people or have friends come over and fuck their girlfriends or whatever on film or something like that. And then they put it on the internet and just waiting for like one of their cousins or something to fucking come upon that and be like, oh yeah, that's my cousin. I forgot that I always feel like when you go to the U porn and stuff, which I don't, I don't do that. I keep it wholesome. Um, I always feel like that's, oh yeah, porn hub. Sorry. Oh, but U porn is a thing though. I always feel like that's shit's fake. Whenever they put like amateur, whatever, I always feel like it's just not. It's just film badly. So then someone's snickering behind the camera. No, it's definitely real. It's definitely real. Well, some of them have got it. They'll do like cam stuff too. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, not that I watch it. I'm just, I am aware of it. I, so I know this girl who, uh, when, when, like several years ago, uh, she's only a couple years younger than me, but at the time that this happened, she was 17. So she was underage and there were these people in like a town over who like had this setup at their house where like the whole place was rigged with cameras. And they would just kind of invite friends over and then they'd like hang out and they'd all be like fucking for the weekend or something. And they'd take all the footage and they just put it on like a paid site that you'd have to, it was behind a paywall. Yeah. And then so people would like sign up on the site and watch these videos. But then like at some point after they stopped doing it, all the videos made their way to, uh, like Pornhub. Oh yeah. So could someone just fucking watch it, ripped it and then posted it. Yeah. Yeah. And they're not filmed well. They're filmed bad because it was like 2002. It looks like shit, but it's still like, it's clear what's going on. It's not that bad. The quality. I mean, as far as the video is concerned. So sometimes I play a game with myself, I'll go to these sites and I'll figure out the right keywords to type in until I find the video, how many pages I have to go to find it. It's usually not more than three. It's typing like amateur, orgy, like, yeah, whatever. And I'll find it. It's fucking up there. And it's like, I just know for like, I guess that's another thing with all this stuff. There's no way to prove it. Like I know that girl is 17 years old and on this website. Yeah. That's fucking weird. It's so weird that like, and I don't want to keep talking about it. I know Jeff doesn't really love talking about porn sites. There's only one porn site.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:27.060 --> 1:10:28.174]: 
  The original relation.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:32.376 --> 1:10:32.697]:

  No.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:02.937 --> 1:11:04.759]: 
  But then like I wonder like maybe

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:11.560 --> 1:11:12.218]: 
  Like that's the last one.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:34.679 --> 1:11:35.505]: 
  That's the...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:35.505 --> 1:11:36.585]: 
  That's my cousin.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:41.918 --> 1:11:45.040]: 
  I always feel like that shit's thingy. Oh yeah, Pornhub. Sorry, Pornhub's much better.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:49.225 --> 1:11:49.680]: 
  Mm-hmm.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:53.984 --> 1:11:59.316]: 
  No, it's definitely real. Well, sell them in the bottom. They'll do like ham stuff too. Yeah. I mean, I...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:05.492 --> 1:12:06.218]: 
  our videos ago

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:39.503 --> 1:13:48.447]:

I found it on the, like, I would search, like once a year I would do a search. I'm like, I'm curious. I'm morbidly curious. But I could never find it. This is like, you know, like one of my like high school ex-girlfriends or something. I'm like, I wonder what she's doing. I look her up like once every couple of years and it's like, I can't find it. I'd give up. But then after that, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:54.319 --> 1:13:55.450]: 
  No, no, no, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:59.989 --> 1:14:01.255]: 
  I'm horribly curious.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:02.318 --> 1:14:02.639]: 
  Like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:14:06.419 --> 1:14:06.959]: 
  But then

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:09.405 --> 1:14:28.626]: 
  I give up but then after I mentioned on the podcast I'm like alright I'm really gonna hunker down I'm gonna find this fucking video I was like I was like it's finally searching I finally found it Yeah, it was like if you search like I don't know I think you know I think honestly all you have to do is search like Goldfish porn and time pops up. I wasn't searching hard enough, but Next topic, please

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:29.250 --> 1:15:26.355]: 
  Moving right along. Please. All right, so some real hard-hitting questions. Are you ready? Yeah. You better be. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Are you, in fact, zone? Am I? Are you zone? Would you believe any answer I told you? Because now I won't. That fucking pause and stutter now. Because think, let's just break this down. If I am zone, I obviously have a vested interest in protecting that information. I don't want you to think I am. So I'm going to tell you I'm not. Sure. If I'm not zone, and I've been pretending to be this whole time, I'm going to keep that going. I'm going to tell you I am. So if I say I am, I'm probably full of shit. And if I say I'm not, I'm probably full of shit. Also, if he is zone, he animates a hell of a lot. Yeah, it's true. If he's red, if he's red, minus, ends out. But see, here's the thing. If you know red minus, you also know that he comes out with a cartoon every three years. So as far as I'm concerned, he is actually zone working on other shit in between that. He does more than that. Come on now.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:44.337 --> 1:14:45.248]: 
  Because now I won't.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:57.212 --> 1:14:58.866]: 
  So I'm going to tell you I'm not. Sure.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:02.916 --> 1:15:03.270]: 
  Right.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:06.477 --> 1:15:08.586]: 
  Also, if he is zone, he animates.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:10.020 --> 1:15:10.999]: 
  Yeah, it's true.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:12.636 --> 1:15:14.627]: 
  But see, here's the thing.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:31.688]: 
  This is a bad kid in compliment for you. Come on. No, no, no, no.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:30.119 --> 1:15:47.567]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:04.628 --> 1:16:05.235]: 
  Oh, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:13.926]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:09.437 --> 1:16:09.944]: 
  Shouldn't have said that.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:13.724 --> 1:16:30.447]: 
  Too late, you gotta drink your kale smoothie and get that beard all over. You gotta make sure that every cocktail you ever drink has bidders. That you wear a vest and a bow tie. Yeah, skinny jeans. Get a little velvet handkerchief to put over in your pocket sleeve.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:16.187 --> 1:16:18.752]: 
  You gotta make sure that every cocktail you ever...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:25.772 --> 1:16:26.768]: 
  Get a little...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:30.447 --> 1:16:32.995]: 
  bicycle around one big wheel and one small wheel

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:32.995 --> 1:16:35.138]: 
  Any farthing?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:36.387 --> 1:16:38.007]: 
  or you're juggling those bowling balls.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:38.007 --> 1:18:09.452]: 
  bowling pins that aren't bowling pins. Don't talk shit about penny farthing, son. What are your goals? What are your goals as an artist? You've been on the internet for a long time. You work for a lot of people. I don't really know much about like original series that you've hit up. I mean there's been a few shorts here and there. Are we serious? You want the real answers? Yeah, what the fuck are you doing, man? Not the dickhead answers? What are you doing? The snarky fake answers. You can go snark first, but I am curious. Yeah, no, I I've just been working on my style, I guess. Like every time I start to commit to drawing stuff, I get a little bit better by the end of it, and then I know what happened at the beginning. Yeah. And then I just want to, I want to finally just get something I'm comfortable with sticking to. Maybe it's kind of weird that I spent so much time doing work and not worrying about that, but it just all caught up with me at some point where I just got real concerned about like making sure things, maybe my own standards for myself got more stringent and not in a productive way, either necessarily. Yeah. You know, like I'm just concerned about things that no one notices. Yeah, it's weird because you always are, but I mean, I just, just maybe more than what is helpful. I've noticed that about your style and it's interesting that you pointed out, but you know, then you think about things like Garfield, right? Yeah. It's like that mother fucker, that guy was like on model for, you know, three decades and then it was done. You know, there was clearly the beginning phase. Yeah, he had some changes, yeah, but once he hit his stride, I was stuck to it. And maybe I feel like that's where I'm at. I want to get to the peak Garfield of my my style arc. The thing is like Garfield Final Forms.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:39.795 --> 1:16:39.947]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:39.947 --> 1:16:40.032]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:47.946 --> 1:16:48.419]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:54.477 --> 1:16:54.915]: 
  We are

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:56.299 --> 1:16:57.008]: 
  Yeah, what the fuck

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:56.502 --> 1:16:57.835]: 
  Yeah, what the fuck are you doing, man?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:57.835 --> 1:16:58.527]: 
  Not the dickhead answer.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:58.527 --> 1:17:01.682]: 
  What are you doing?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:03.724 --> 1:17:04.500]: 
  You can go start.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:17:05.344 --> 1:17:06.880]: 
  I am curious.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:17:16.397 --> 1:17:16.718]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:36.344 --> 1:17:36.816]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:39.972 --> 1:17:40.461]: 
  Yeah, it's...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:17:50.670 --> 1:17:51.227]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:17:58.281 --> 1:17:58.298]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:58.298 --> 1:17:59.091]: 
  Yeah, he had some...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:18:01.015 --> 1:18:02.534]: 
  That was it. I may be a failure.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:07.326 --> 1:18:19.459]: 
  The thing is, like, the Sperfield Final Form. I was gonna say how much effort this guy puts into his work. Like, he was showing me earlier, uh, just a character's arm bending, where somebody would just would have animated, like, a lower arm and an upper arm and just tweened it or something. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:18.700 --> 1:18:24.606]: 
  Yeah, he had like it wasn't even like frame by frame. It was like tweened, but yes every line was yeah everything

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:22.952 --> 1:18:28.977]: 
  Yes, every line was tween like she queen. Oh, but look perfect. Oh, that's that thing that Harry should

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:26.344 --> 1:18:26.817]: 
  Oh.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:27.627 --> 1:18:38.950]: 
  Oh, that's that thing that Harry showed us on Twitter that was similar to that. Yeah Look at this cool experiment that you should never actually do because yeah, thanks for fucking ever Yeah, I don't think it was particularly productive

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:29.567 --> 1:18:31.086]: 
  It was similar to that.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:18:34.275 --> 1:18:35.794]: 
  It tastes for fucking ever

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:35.507 --> 1:18:35.693]: 
  Bye for now.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:38.444 --> 1:18:39.945]: 
  It's okay, look at that.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:39.945 --> 1:19:07.452]: 
  Just wanted to see if it was possible. I guess I'm also in that phase where I'm seeing what's possible. Yeah, like not necessarily Finishing stuff, you know, like I'm trying to finish things but in the meantime I'm like I wonder if I just did this if it would work and then it kind of does but it also kind of looks like it's useless And doesn't fit in and a week went by. Yeah, that's right. Yeah And so I can kind of put a little fucking clip of it on Instagram and just move on But that doesn't count anymore. You got to get your you got to get your YouTube

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:44.620 --> 1:18:45.109]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:18:55.994 --> 1:18:57.495]: 
  And a week went by.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:57.495 --> 1:18:57.799]: 
  That's right.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:02.153 --> 1:19:02.541]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:05.747 --> 1:19:16.514]: 
  I think we were talking about some possibly exciting ideas. Oh, I say I don't know. Yeah, you can say you can Well, we were we were like, you know, we're saying now. Maybe he should get in them some game. Oh, yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:09.359 --> 1:19:12.160]: 
  Oh, yeah, you can say you can say

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:15.788 --> 1:21:04.463]: 
  Oh yeah, I've been thinking about that for a long time. You have a great style for game art things. Especially like those cut scenes and like RPGs and shit like that. Cut scenes and portraits, but I like, you know, like when the RPGs, when they have the portrait with the text. Yeah, that's what I meant. Yeah, I like that kind of thing. That's what I meant by cut, sorry. The dialogue scenes, you know, like those type of things. I really like like character design and character rigging in terms of sprites. And that's, I guess it ends up with like a lot of the shots I do in my cartoons are kind of flat and static almost in like a comic strip kind of way. We have two people talking. Yeah. And that works sometimes with a lot of, sometimes it gets a bit tired. I'm in a, something I'm working on right now, I'm having trouble fitting the more dynamic shots in with the fact that the main block of dialogue is in that format. Notice if it's like 99% or like 90%, even if it's like 80%, like a very 2D flat kind of setup. Yeah. If you try to throw a dynamic shot in there, all of a sudden it's like, it just feels like it doesn't fit. Weird, like some other thing that doesn't belong. Yeah. Yeah. You have to really, so I'm trying to, I'm trying to move towards more dynamic stuff, which I'm not comfortable with. And that's what I'm trying to do more of it. But at the basis of all that for me, yeah, like I, I approach things more in terms of what you would think of is like kind of sprite animation, like the side facing stuff and a lot of, and a lot of movements. And like the idea of designing a character that can do a bunch of stuff all from one perspective as though you're going to use it a whole bunch of times, which is exactly how game stuff works. So I'm totally, I would love to find some way to start doing more, like maybe start on some game stuff that in a way that wouldn't suck up my whole year before I got tends to, you know, like dabble a little bit before. You wouldn't want to spend a whole year on a game, dude. I mean, let's be honest. A whole year on a game is kind of overkill. Whoa, a year, though. I mean, that's why you know what I mean. A year on a game. Come on, dude. I'm just saying, I'd like to do a tiny thing to see if I even like it first.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:18.150 --> 1:19:18.167]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:23.871 --> 1:19:24.580]: 
  That's the reason.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:28.140 --> 1:19:30.300]: 
  Yeah, that's what I meant. Yeah, I like that kind of thing.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:33.726 --> 1:19:35.110]: 
  Yeah, I really like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:47.108 --> 1:19:47.749]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:48.407 --> 1:19:48.863]: 
  Ja.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:59.984 --> 1:20:00.962]: 
  I've noticed if it's like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:11.003 --> 1:20:13.247]: 
  Weird like some other thing that doesn't belong.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:27.777 --> 1:20:28.502]: 
  Like the side face.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:29.447 --> 1:20:29.717]: 
  rollough to between Greek Golbson's ticket

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:37.412 --> 1:20:37.699]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:48.938 --> 1:20:50.136]: 
  You know? Like, dabble it.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:51.216 --> 1:20:51.824]: 
  You wouldn't want to say that.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:56.093]: 
  I just mean you're in a game

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:58.557 --> 1:21:00.210]: 
  That's why you know what I mean.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:01.375 --> 1:21:02.320]: 
  I'm just saying, I'd like to

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:01.493 --> 1:21:02.303]: 
  I'm just saying, I'd like to

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:03.653 --> 1:21:09.340]: 
  first before I committed that much. I think people would love it. That's what I think. That's the only positive thing I'm saying today.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:08.631 --> 1:21:17.423]: 
  Yeah, that was it's so funny because it was the most positive thing you said but you sounded the most miserable when you said

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:15.769 --> 1:21:20.258]: 
  I see this way too often, but like, and like, him and Stamper, like, their polish is like, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:19.617 --> 1:23:13.439]: 
  Yeah, I took a lot of my cues from stamper actually and Jeff to when I was first starting Trying to figure out how to do animation. It was mostly like I mean a lot of Jeff's earlier stuff Yeah, that's how I started and a lot of stampers earlier stuff not stampers earlier earlier stuff But like earlier than now I mean like you know like that Rebecca thing that stamper made a long time ago like my friends were passing that around I saw that I didn't even put it together that it was him till more recently I didn't even realize yeah, so yeah that kind of that kind of stuff But in terms of your long-term goals, you don't know. I don't know. No, I don't know I just like all of us were all just fucking yeah, no I mean, it's I think like this is good This is good to sound really pretentious too, maybe but I think that like if I did now then that would get a little bit less Exciting sure most you know yeah, like if I knew exactly what it was I was trying to do and I was only gonna do that and if it didn't work out I'd just go sell cars or some shit. I feel like that would make things a little more boring I feel like in some of the conversations is becoming clear It's less about like oh, I know the exact job title I want now Yeah, more about like I don't know what it is exactly all the things that I do Accommonate to but I know I want to make a game. I want to make a movie I want to you know, right now or be a part of like a book like a children's book or I feel like people have projects in mind Yeah, rather than like a to yeah I mean don't you feel like most people you talk to in this kind of area Stuff kind of all say similar have similar story. Yeah, right? Like everyone's doing whatever they're doing at the time, but they're not like totally glued to it necessarily Maybe when they finish it, they'll do something else But as far as like a as far as like a long-term game plan, that's hard man You start thinking if you think about it too hard you start to really freak yourself out Of course you will like you need to you got so many years. Yeah any of these things, you know And maybe that's maybe that's what's taken me so long She says you ever do you run into people that that you tell them what you do and they're like do they They sort of have this air of condescension like you don't have a real job or something

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:28.662 --> 1:21:28.949]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:28.949 --> 1:21:30.299]: 
  That's how I started.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:45.385 --> 1:21:45.587]: 
  video.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:51.240 --> 1:21:51.679]: 
  I like it.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:53.063 --> 1:21:53.704]: 
  Yeah!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:03.492 --> 1:22:04.572]: 
  sure must.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:34.626 --> 1:22:34.947]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:22:34.947 --> 1:22:35.993]: 
  Rather than like

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:35.993 --> 1:22:36.516]: 
  That's good.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:49.712 --> 1:22:49.999]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:51.940 --> 1:22:52.767]: 
  as far as like a...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:22:59.534 --> 1:23:01.424]: 
  He only got so many years to do anything.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:02.588 --> 1:23:03.060]: 
  And maybe that's the problem.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:13.439 --> 1:23:14.569]: 
  I don't think you ever get that.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:14.350 --> 1:24:19.859]: 
  I think I'm super prepared to get that when I tell them and so I am always trying to watch what I say when I Don't want to say something that sounds too silly like some like ironic self-deprecating joke I make fart jokes. I'll just fucking stupid dumb things But I also don't want to which is I think one of my tag lines on Twitter or something But I also don't want to oversell either right. Yeah, I have never I've never settled on a title I've only in the past couple years even accepted that like if someone says like are you an artist I can say yeah I still feel weird even saying that it's a weird thing. It's a weird It's coming from both of you you guys are artists. I still don't subscribe I'm a designer sure. I mean I went to art school So yeah, so maybe that's part of where my animosity towards the term comes from There's so many people who are like prepared to be who really want to be artists Yeah, first and foremost and then decide what that means after they rally behind that flag pretty hard I feel weird calling myself an animator when there's people like Yeah, like like Paul Sandra, you know, yeah, yeah, like no that Jeff. Yeah, of course

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:27.124 --> 1:23:31.934]: 
  I make fart jokes on the internet. Yeah, I just move fucking stupid dumb things, but I also don't want to like... Which is, I think...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:33.739 --> 1:23:35.798]: 
  It's like my description.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:46.834 --> 1:23:49.146]: 
  It's a weird thing. It's a weird color for both of you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:54.225 --> 1:23:54.495]: 
  Sure.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:54.495 --> 1:23:55.289]:

  I feel like

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:09.497 --> 1:24:09.902]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:21.462 --> 1:24:22.035]: 
  Bueno.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:24.938 --> 1:24:28.448]: 
  like I can't even, I need what I'm working on to be.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:28.448 --> 1:24:31.418]: 
  out and out there before I could even claim.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:30.675 --> 1:24:38.438]: 
  Yeah, but once people see the animations that you have been working on, then there is no way. Yeah, I just feel weird saying I'm proud of something nobody

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:38.438 --> 1:24:41.459]: 
  ever fucking seen yeah well you should be it's

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:39.619 --> 1:25:20.946]: 
  Yeah, well you should be it's fucking awesome. Let's get there. I don't know I think for that particular thing, you know, maybe not to talk too much about it if you're trying not to hype Yeah, like I feel like there's enough done in it I mean that I saw these showed me that like even if like let's say something happens and it doesn't get done You still have like a shitload of stuff. Yeah, no, there's so much stuff Yeah, I mean assets loops fucking everything you could make such a killer trailer with just what's already there Yeah, now if you were to like do like one of those like really fast like this shot that shot this shot this shot You know what I mean? Like you get together something that people would be like what the fuck is this? I want this now. Yeah, I would like a nice trailer

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:43.585 --> 1:24:43.602]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:48.917 --> 1:24:49.137]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:24:58.469 --> 1:25:00.173]: 
  Yeah, there's so much stuff.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:25:04.139 --> 1:25:04.999]: 
  make such a big difference.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:25:07.379 --> 1:25:07.885]: 
  Take care.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:25:20.946 --> 1:25:23.950]: 
  in a few months hopefully. Yeah, I think it might even be motivating.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:22.178 --> 1:32:03.297]: 
  Yeah, I think might even be motivating for you guys to have that around. Yeah, and you see it and you get people's reactions You can other people's energy. Yeah, that's that's super helpful I've been I've been posting more I was I never wanted to post progress Stuff because all my things are so short and they usually rely on some twist or right to make it worthwhile So I never wanted to show right too much to give that away And that's what's usually what I have a hard time wanting to stream or anything because I don't want to do something that Yeah, the people watching it's hard to pick those moments Lately I've been doing I've been posting like a lot of more progress stuff like oh my tumblr is a good place It's like an archive And Twitter sometimes too, but I like to put it on tumblr because you can always go look it's easy to find stuff People kind of seem to like that and then it's just like maybe just not even a big response from people necessarily But just like a little bit of nod that you need to be like alright. Yeah, okay cool I'll keep and I think anything to get you out of the vacuum of what you're doing. Yeah Yeah, you just need to like it's it's weird especially now that everything we're doing is on you know Virtual like it's not a physical work. It's on computers and it would be analogous to like showing a person a piece of paper Something you drew on and then be like yeah nice. Yeah, you know, that's just all it is. Yeah I heard a real crazy story this one time is there's this guy who was I want to say serial killer But he only killed one person so it wasn't actually serial But it was like heinous right like it was like grotesque a grotesque single murder that was like serial killer Ask in the the caliber of how horrifying it was Doesn't work that way. I just did my stupid idiot brain. Oh, okay Like serial killer is the title for a guy who's fucked up. Okay. No, so it was some dude who? Had befriended a guy who was like a naval officer or an American Seaman yes during who was stationed somewhere in around Asia during the famine in China the mouth all that mouse shit And so like he got stranded in China like his boat left or something and there was like cannibalism going on So this dude the naval dude Eventually got back to the States and you know kind of had a life after that and he met this other guy The killer guy in question. I'm not telling this very well But anyway, it's more confusing than it needs to be so this dude gets stranded in China ends up eating some people because that's what's going on Then you have to right he comes back to the States Someone makes friends with him and he's telling him like yeah, you know, it was fucked up But I honestly it wasn't bad Yeah, and so this dude that he tells about that kind of gets it in his head like oh Maybe now I want to try it right and he starts thinking about it more and more and he gets this He's kind of an old guy and at some point he like befriends this family and like eats their daughter Like he gets in good with them and he kind of is like And all like they think he's a friendly old man He kind of looks after their like young kids Wait, is this the is this like the guy who looked like Larry David a little bit? I think I saw yeah That could be yeah Is this the guy who like came over and he was like looking for people to help him on the like his farmhouse or something and Originally he wanted oh no no that guy was a serial killer never mind Yeah, the guy I'm thinking about was a serial killer and he Essentially he went to this house because he saw a kid going in there And he wanted this young boy to like come up to his house and he was gonna kill him that was the deal Right, but and he looked like this very frail old man But anyways, he goes to the house they knock on the door and this little girl comes to the door and immediately He changes his mind. He's like holy shit. Fuck that kid. I want this girl. She's like she's like seven This is what I want. Yeah, so then he like somehow convinces the mom to like Let her hang out with him like he's got a granddaughter with a birthday or something And so she's like very reluctant, but you know, he looks he looks harmless He looks innocent so she you know like all good mothers just lets the stranger take her child Um yeah, and the thing is is he wrote a letter outlining everything that happened but essentially he was up in the attic of this farmhouse that he had brought this daughter to and He wrote about how he could see her in the front yard picking flowers gathering flowers as he stripped down naked He then called to her from the window to come into the house These may not be all the details, but it's pretty cool And then he hid up in the attic for her to come find him at which point when she came up He presented himself nude to this, you know Pre-pubescent child and then proceeded to kill her. I don't remember if he liked stabbed her I think maybe he did or strangled her and then on top of that He freaking ate her. Yeah, we're probably talking about the same guy Yeah, he took like he didn't just eat her all alone go he like cooked parts of her right Yeah This is the same thing and then he like put him like in a basket It would like take it with him into town and like he'd be in a bus stop or something It's like a nibble and just have a little nibble of your of like her arm or something like that But he wrote this letter right that's the part now when you say that that rings a bell. Yeah Yeah, and it was like and but he said like I never sexually assaulted her right. Yeah. Yeah, don't worry Yeah, I never touched her like that But I had every intention and he didn't explain like I had every intention meeting your son or whatever but instead I ate your daughter Yeah, just like, you know, that's the same best like maybe yeah, no No, that might have been the same on the details, but that was the same guy Yeah, yeah, he got that idea cuz he met someone that part I didn't that he didn't go that far in his letter That's what put in his head. Yeah, you know, it's see when you hear a letter like that You're surprised he didn't add details like that. Yeah, like hey, this wasn't really my idea I just happened to have a friend. It was like so nonchalant and like yeah It was very matter of fact. Yeah matter of fact like like like as though like hey, don't worry. There was no rapey stuff Yeah, like oh thank okay. I was just eating part of her head on the subway today. Yeah, it does make you wonder Just yeah, just the people that you're around, huh? You know, yeah Yeah, you pass by on the street someone you sit down next to I think of that sometimes on a bus Or a restaurant the guy in the booth right behind you was he capable of was he capable of did he have they like yeah Like sometimes you like you know you try to go into like a 7-eleven And then the door kind of closes abruptly behind you and like kind of blocks off the person and you know shit Sorry, you kind of keep help them. Yeah, sure they get in without the door closing rudely or something like that Like you and then you feel like oh, I was I should have been paying attention But maybe that person just came back from like skinning two people in his meat Absolutely, you know absolutely that guy somebody somebody drops a little coin purse, you know You're like oh, excuse me ma'am and you pick it up. Yeah. Thank you I don't think they walk away And it happens to have like the fingers of some guy that she just fucking murdered, you know something you want to tell us Mick

  As you do.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:29:58.439 --> 1:30:00.953]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:30:13.761 --> 1:30:14.436]:

  He didn't get it.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:30:47.444 --> 1:30:48.709]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:30:53.181 --> 1:30:53.468]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:30:59.003 --> 1:30:59.948]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:31:01.500 --> 1:31:01.804]:

  Thank you. They walk around.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:32:07.009 --> 1:32]: 
  This is why I'm on the third floor. See, they're trying to get something out of here. There's an attic above this room.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:32:07.195 --> 1:32:07.499]: 
  This is why I'm here.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:32:07.988 --> 1:32:08.882]: 
  It's fun.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:32:09.743 --> 1:32:10.739]: 
  There's a there's a

 SPEAKER_01 [1:32 --> 1:32:14.789]: 
  No, I can understand.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:32:14.046 --> 1:34:43.744]: 
  You haven't seen it yet? No, not yet. You haven't seen it. I think you should check it out. It's a good kill room. Well, we call it, one of them is the hostage room. Oh. Yeah, because it is clearly a hostage room. And then the other one is more of like a gather a bunch of like kids from overseas, like human trafficking and just kind of like pile them together in the attic room. That's the other one. Right. Is that what we're thinking about? How many people must be in that situation right now? You know, like when they find somebody who's been in like a basement for 10 years. I feel like there's been a rash. They're like, hooray, they're free, but there's probably like so many people right now that are locked in a basement. Oh yeah, we've never found. I mean, yeah, we find the miracle cases where people like someone clogged their way, they like chewed off their own arm, clogged through a basement, and there happened to be like people on the street, you know what I mean? But like, those are the lottery winners. Yeah, yeah. You're saying like. You assume that the outlier are the ones who are even able to be kept for that long, but maybe the outliers are the ones that escaped. Yeah, sorry, go ahead. No, just per capita, the amount of those situations is probably low, but per capita, in a high enough population, you know, 350 million people in the United States, if like, like what percent is it got to be, maybe there's like a thousand. And of those, I mean, you break it down by the stats. You've got the people who escaped obviously, the smallest, you know, group. Yeah. Two groups left. You've got people who are still being held captive and people who died in captivity. Yeah, yeah. So, you know, there's this. Jimmy, who about that guy that had like a fucking unnatural, creepy, weird crush, this older dude who had this crush on like this young, like late teens, kind of maybe 20 year old woman. And he was like old enough to be like her father or grandfather, kind of like he was an old man and he like. But I mean, to be fair, it sounds like a lot of middle aged men's things. Yeah, no, that part wasn't that strange. It was strange that he was like very obsessive about it. And then like she died for some reason, unrelated to his fixation, I think. And then like he somehow like embalmed her body and like kept replacing as it slowly dilapidated. He was like replacing it with like sawdust and like crumpled up newspaper and stuff. When they eventually got it, it was like they eventually discovered that he still had this fucking body that he was supposed to have buried or cremated because I think that was part of his job. Yeah, it was like this paper mache face looking situation. And they were like, it was all written. The article I read talked about it like, oh, he was he was just so in love that he wanted to preserve her beauty. And then the article ends with like, oh, yeah, and they fed a whole bunch of semen.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:32:20.222 --> 1:32:20.256]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:32:37.182 --> 1:32:38.042]: 
  Is that weird to think about?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:32:43.915 --> 1:32:44.235]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:32:45.079 --> 1:32:47.205]: 
  I feel like there's been a rash like hooray there free

 SPEAKER_01 [1:32:50.209 --> 1:32:52.335]: 
  Oh yeah, we never refound. I mean, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:33:06.612 --> 1:33:07.439]: 
  Да, да, да.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:33:07.439 --> 1:33:08.822]: 
  You're saying like...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:33:15.066 --> 1:33:15.944]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:33:15.944 --> 1:33:17.513]: 
  No, just per capita

 SPEAKER_00 [1:33:21.765 --> 1:33:23.858]: 
  in a high enough population.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:33:29.747 --> 1:33:29.865]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:33:35.181 --> 1:33:35.974]: 
  Right.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:33:45.340 --> 1:33:47.382]: 
  Yeah, yeah. So, you know, there's this.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:34:00.831 --> 1:34:02.265]: 
  But to be fair, it sounds like a lot of

 SPEAKER_00 [1:34:03.767 --> 1:34:03.835]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:34:30.599 --> 1:34:31.071]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:34:45.381 --> 1:35:34.673]: 
  Like, no, no, don't make no mistake. This is almost identical except for the semen and in the relationship as a video that Zach put on for us downstairs the other day, which kind of gave me like subtle nightmares. Yeah, DJ, what's his name? DJ Def Man? I have not seen this video in a long time and I don't want to see it. It's like DJ Def Man or something and it was this guy, I guess he's Def, and he's a DJ, I don't know how that works, but essentially his mom died. Or his grandma died. And we're doing the same video, the casket in his backyard. Yeah, yeah, so he like films the casket of his grandma in his backyard, his mom or his grandma, I can't remember. And he basically, first you just see the casket, you're like, oh, okay, that's kind of creepy. It's like, yeah, we haven't been able to find a place to bury it, even though he doesn't say it. Like, oh, you're right.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:34:46.495 --> 1:34:47.862]: 
  Don't make no mistake.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:34:57.413 --> 1:35:00.450]: 
  subtle nightmares yeah DJ what's his name

 SPEAKER_01 [1:35:14.845 --> 1:35:14.879]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:35:16.043 --> 1:35:16.937]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:35:36.495 --> 1:36:47.809]: 
  And they have like subtitle like he he has boys he has subtitles underneath. Yeah, so people understand But then what ends up happening is is he opens it and she's there and he like takes these very long cross-fading video like like shaky hand cam Video footage of it and it's got this creepy music Or maybe he didn't have any music the thing that was really creepy is it did like a starburst swipe every single time there was a Caption Okay, okay. Yes, he kisses her But the way the camera has it and the way he kisses her It's like a vampire Dropped a bag of blood on a floor and they needed to lick it up like he violently like Like you like his head is craned in and it's like spastically kind of like And it was so out of place considering how chill and calm he was to me I was like, oh He's gonna give her a polite peck and it's still gonna be creepy because it's a decomposing head But but the way and then he like wiped it off too. Yeah. Yeah, you know what a little decent

 SPEAKER_01 [1:35:37.997 --> 1:35:40.748]:
