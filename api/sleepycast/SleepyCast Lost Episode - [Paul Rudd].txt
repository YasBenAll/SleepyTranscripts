  Who's talking about Paul Rudd? I don't know, it's like four in the morning and we're just talking about Paul Rudd.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:23.438 --> 0:10:31.757]: 
  Jeff, you're a liar. It's 320. What? Right. One. 321. 321. Run.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:30.019 --> 0:10:36.550]: 
  Right, right, right. Would you tell anybody if you saw Paul Rudd eating spaghetti and a roast, or he would, would, what?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:36.297 --> 0:10:40.448]: 
  Why do you think Paul Rudd is gonna just wave to you every chance he gets? Because you look, you see, oh...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:40.448 --> 0:10:42.962]: 
  Oh, is that poor? I would tell my friends.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:10:41.207 --> 0:10:53.847]: 
  I would tell my friends at the restaurant, they'd be like, hey, I think it's Paul Rudd. He walked over to the spaghetti, hey guys! The second I left the restaurant, I totally forget I saw him and wouldn't tell anybody ever again.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:46.489 --> 0:10:47.451]: 
  And then the second...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:49.493 --> 0:10:50.877]: 
  Hey guys, it's me, Paul Roe.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:53.594 --> 0:10:58.707]: 
  This is just like your weird sexual fantasy to have Paul Rudd acknowledge you in public and come up and talk to you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:56.614 --> 0:11:02.065]: 
  You would what? Like, and come up and talk to you. Listen, your spaghetti's all right. It's your favorite spaghetti restaurant. You're sitting here.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:01.980 --> 0:11:04.444]: 
  Sit down. Spaghetti's are us.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:04.444 --> 0:11:07.414]: 
  Is that real? That could be a real place. Anyway, continue.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:06.537 --> 0:11:11.734]: 
  Anyway, continue. He said really fast, but he's spaghetti, as a word.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:10.671 --> 0:11:14.080]: 
  As a word. Yeah. With just marinara, like mint sauce.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:13.590 --> 0:11:28.390]: 
  No, they only have one kind of spaghetti, French sauce, noodles. What if it's red? The minute he just says spaghetti. What if it's red sauce? You know, like, no. You got red sauce? He could say it is. He could say, oh, it's red sauce. And they go, no, it's still spaghetti sauce. Don't make it up. What is, what's in red sauce? Don't fuck it up, restaurant.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:16.949 --> 0:11:17.303]: 
  if it's right.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:19.041 --> 0:11:19.159]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:21.100 --> 0:11:22.281]: 
 ...to第一 place!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:26.010 --> 0:11:33.621]: 
  Don't make it up. Don't fuck with our restaurant. What? Put in red sauce. Paul, run. It's probably just water. I bet you it's really blood.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:30.465 --> 0:11:31.495]: 
  This is Paul Ryan.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:31.495 --> 0:11:36.507]: 
  It's probably just water. I bet you it's really bland. I'll tell you that much. It's really bland.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:36.507 --> 0:11:38.481]: 
  Yeah, you know, just, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:37.215 --> 0:11:37.232]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:41.772 --> 0:11:47.948]: 
  Yeah, okay. I imagine it's like a milky, it's got a milky, it's edible color to it, but it doesn't have any taste.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:47.948 --> 0:11:51.036]: 
  It's edible. I don't want them waving me a wah-wah and saying

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:51.036 --> 0:12:06.494]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:20.348 --> 0:12:23.470]: 
  That's what you're preparing Jeff for? I might nod slightly.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:22.845 --> 0:12:25.950]: 
  What do you think? I think I'd give a nod at him.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:25.950 --> 0:12:33.983]: 
  I'd be like, get the fuck away from me. I'm trying to eat my spaghetti. Not good with buddy, touches your shoulder. Good with. What if you came home and tried to steal the garlic bread? I'd be like, Paul runs a fucking castle.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:33.359 --> 0:12:34.827]: 
  Slap is heen.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:33.375 --> 0:12:46.369]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:07.935 --> 0:13:12.947]: 
  I love you man. That's his crowning achievement.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:12.947 --> 0:13:18.077]: 
  What if he's a total asshole in real life? What if he ran over to your table and started eating your spaghetti with his bare hands?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:17.419 --> 0:13:24.338]: 
  What do you fucking do? What do you fucking do? Do some baggy punch me. Punch for a ride. Nobody can see you.

  The kids ran out of spaghetti. Give me your spaghetti. I see him. What worse?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:33.990 --> 0:13:49.515]: 
  It's the worst as him coming over and like arrogantly sticking like just one finger in your food and then like licking it and then walking away. And then smiling with that smug face of his where he's just like Mmmmmm Puts you into water and polaroids. Do eating spiety like that is too much personality for Paul Rudd. Yeah, that's true.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:40.184 --> 0:13:43.997]: 
  and he's smiling with that smug face where he's just like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:43.997 --> 0:13:45.786]: 
  See you later.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:49.499 --> 0:13:54.949]: 
  You ever eat spaghetti with your bare hands though? It's really liberating. You just take a big plate of it and just grab it and just...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:53.481 --> 0:13:53.751]: 
  Go ahead.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:54.612 --> 0:13:58.510]: 
  I think the closest thing I've done that is you though, the good, like a dog.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:57.801 --> 0:14:01.345]: 
  You savages can do what you want. I'm not going to eat. I'm not going to eat.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:00.670 --> 0:14:10.980]: 
  Alright, Queen Victoria, Queen Victoria married Paul Rudd. This is my husband, Paul Rudd. The most interesting man on the face of the planet.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:11.234 --> 0:14:15.435]: 
  What do you think Polar with the favorite color is? You think it's really like blue? Gray?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:15.435 --> 0:14:20.312]: 
  Hey, can we make Paul Gettios with red sauce one night?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:19.857 --> 0:14:25.307]: 
  What's spaghetti? Spaghetti and red balls?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:23.485 --> 0:14:40.208]: 
  What do you think the conversion for that would be? What do you think? How would he advertise it? Hey guys, people are right. You probably saw me over there and over there that movie one time. I was over there too one time. That's what I was beginning though. Come on. Want to see what it is? You have to wait till you get at the bottom of the can.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:28.919 --> 0:14:28.935]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:28.935 --> 0:14:28.952]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:32.496 --> 0:14:33.947]: 
  Oh, it's over there too with time.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:33.947 --> 0:14:34.622]: 
  Just for life's sake.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:40.208 --> 0:14:51.599]: 
  I think he would allow, he would allow one chest hair to escape his car. I'm saying, he's a ticy, he's saying- He's slightly dangerous, not too dangerous.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:46.232 --> 0:14:47.447]: 
  I'm sad.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:51.599 --> 0:15:05.402]: 
  Listen, I think this is a good idea. You buy this spaghetti because it gives you a taste. He says, hey, you want the rest of it? It's at the bottom of the can. So when you dump out the can of spaghetti sauce, uh-huh. I'm sure it looks like that. Show it everything.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:05.402 --> 0:15:15.814]: 
  He himself is at the bottom of the can of spaghetti sauce. Yeah, because you buy it, he shows you a little bit. Well, he's just little, or it's a photo of him. What are you talking about? Shut up!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:13.806 --> 0:15:22.446]: 
  What are you talking about shut up? In the commercial, this is Bellyup, it says here you would see the rest of this by the spaghetti sauce and you'll see me at the bottom of the spaghetti sauce

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:22.446 --> 0:15:28.352]: 
  Oh, everybody uses a full jar of spaghetti sauce when they make spaghetti anyways. You just dump it in. You gotta prepare a few compliments of box.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:26.513 --> 0:15:32.402]: 
  We have been talking about this mediocre human being for over 20 years.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:32.014 --> 0:15:42.021]: 
  That's fucked up. He's gonna listen to this. Don't call him mediocre. He's a great guy. He's a perfectly acceptable guy. He makes more money than you do. He's jealous. Well... I'm on Rudside.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:41.481 --> 0:15:45.936]: 
  Those are both true facts.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:45.717 --> 0:15:50.475]: 
  How big do you think his dick is?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:50.475 --> 0:15:52.500]: 
  Average? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:52.500 --> 0:15:56.719]: 
  Okay, yeah. Trying to come up with a clever answer. I wouldn't be so, I don't think I'd be so...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:55.082 --> 0:15:58.002]: 
  I wouldn't be surprised if I saw pride

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:58.002 --> 0:16:02.406]: 
  Just maybe the perfect human male white male average.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:02.406 --> 0:16:06.945]: 
  Not bad, not great, you wouldn't talk about it, would you? Yeah, it'd be like half the size of mine.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:05.967 --> 0:16:14.421]: 
  You know what? You ever see those pictures when people take hundreds of portraits of humans? And they should do it personally? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:06.945 --> 0:16:06.962]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:08.802 --> 0:16:10.084]:

  There he is. He might not even be real. You don't know if he's real.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:25.609 --> 0:16:34.452]: 
  You think he was the scientist trying to actually make that guy? He got loose and wanted to run to a Hollywood tour. Nobody stopped him.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:34.452 --> 0:16:38.249]: 
  He's like, he's like, bison tenio man. Oh yeah, that fucks me up.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:37.574 --> 0:16:56.052]:

  So we'll see the father.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:55.562 --> 0:17:01.890]: 
  Was that a horror movie that that Jurassic Park dude was in? Like something arising? Oh, oh yeah.
