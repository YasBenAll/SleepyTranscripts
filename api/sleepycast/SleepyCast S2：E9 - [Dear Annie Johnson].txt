 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:00.497 --> 0:00:23.515]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:23.025 --> 0:01:09.195]: 
  Welcome to Sleepy Cabin season 2 episode 9. Yeah with my friend Shad my other friend Hi, I'm Jeff and my third friend Mick and I just got back from a two-week vacation in Missouri and Illinois felt like forever. I gotta admit that we missed you. Thank you. Let me tell you something It's something I say by accident, but I say a lot of really stupid stuff and people it's like my Choreisms as it's been But I say Illinois and it pisses Lexi off. Yeah, but you do it intentionally No completely by accident because I'll say we're going to Illinois and then I'd be like oh, we're in Illinois And it's consistent. This is just a funny funny little thing you do. I sort of add s's to a lot of words

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:32.999 --> 0:00:33.859]: 
  and I just got

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:40.997 --> 0:00:41.132]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:55.544 --> 0:00:56.016]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:05.212 --> 0:01:06.344]: 
  a lot of words.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:06.968 --> 0:01:08.858]: 
  I'm on the verge of having a word.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:01:10.140 --> 0:03:13.935]: 
  But it's not even a list, it's literally like, just adding the word, there's an S on the end. I like to think that there's more of like every word I say. Yeah. There's a spelling spell to an S. Yeah, yeah. So it kind of makes sense that you would think. You know, the problem with the English language, there's a lot of really strange words we have and like there's a lot of words that are said the same way and places in like Japan is like spoken one way. But like you say like there, there, there and there. There's like four different words, but it all means the same. There's like that for like, we take away letters sometimes, like Illinois isn't there? Well, okay, before it gets mad, they don't mean the same thing. No, but I mean like they sound the same, I guess. Yeah. They don't mean the same thing because there's like ownership and describing something. What English words do we have now? Too many, especially with the Urban Dictionary, Roland O'Rourke. And we also have like, I love the Urban Dictionary. There's like one word that bothers me, it's like 16ths. You mean like the fraction? Yeah, like the 16ths of something. It's such a weird and strange word. It's also a weird number. If someone's using 16ths as a measurement. If you're the 16th of something. Yeah, unless you're like an architect or something, I don't understand why you'd even be using that measurement. We just need to be like 16. I'm sorry, what? 16th. 16th. Now, I'm sorry, what's the logic of that? 17, 16th, 18. 20. You need your own 19. You need your own shoot off in English like, like a Switzerland has, Switzerland's Swiss German. Yeah, you have core English. Core English. How did you pronounce baloney? Baloney? No, there was one where I was like, Oh no, it's a cologne. Cologne, I said cologna. That's how it's directly spelled. And I sometimes they spell words directly. I don't know what it is. My brain doesn't work like others. You know what's interesting though, we've never had a situation where we didn't actually understand what you were saying. But if I said, what the fuck is cologna, what would you think at that point? I would know what you were talking about. Do you know what I thought it was? I went out to a dinner party, I didn't have enough cologna, I stank like a horse. I thought it was. What? I wouldn't say that because I know what the word fucking cologne means. I'm not going to be like, Oh, just when you read it, you're like, what is this? What's this salad? Why do I need this on my salad?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:12.503 --> 0:01:13.448]: 
  We are adding our somethin'

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:14.241 --> 0:01:15.186]: 
  I like to think that

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:17.346 --> 0:01:20.957]: 
  Yeah. This is really nice. Really nice build with an S. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:25.210 --> 0:01:25.328]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:35.520 --> 0:01:36.398]: 
  All right.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:37.444 --> 0:01:37.697]: 
  there's a

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:41.207 --> 0:01:42.456]: 
  isn't there still a noise?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:47.856 --> 0:01:48.666]: 
  Quem quer physics, o K grâce de sua população gloriosa preservada do بخرام.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:50.826 --> 0:01:54.437]: 
  Why are there English words do we have now? Too many. Especially with the urban dictionary.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:54.437 --> 0:01:55.450]: 
  We're actually rolling around.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:56.850 --> 0:01:58.200]: 
  I love your dictionary.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:09.270 --> 0:02:10.131]: 
  and measurements.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:19.834 --> 0:02:21.572]: 
  No. I'm sorry, what's the logic?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:32.305 --> 0:02:35.140]: 
  You have Korean English.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:38.700 --> 0:02:44.454]: 
  There was one where I remember. Oh no! I said cologne. Cologne, I said cologne.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:50.850 --> 0:02:51.036]: 
  ranchie has a tremendous youth background, and then that's, yeah. They, again, do exist in the nation. You know,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:51.036 --> 0:02:51.542]: 
  forward

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:59.254 --> 0:02:59.828]: 
  Do you know what I mean?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:03.794 --> 0:03:06.915]: 
  You know what I thought it was? What? I wouldn't say that because I know it was...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:08.974 --> 0:03:11.438]: 
  I'm not gonna be like oh just when you might like what is this?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:13.935 --> 0:03:15.505]: 
  I fucked up a word and on a-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:15.505 --> 0:06:34.562]: 
  episode like 12 ago and somebody like 300 people called me out in the comments. Is it because you said it numerous times? I knew better, I knew better, but for some reason I visual- I don't say the word enough so I just visualized it in my head and I just immediately said it the way it was spelled. Oh yeah, there's like a hundred English teachers. This is unfulish. I feel like it's not so bad of it if you drop it once, like the ear pricks up. But it's when you're talking about a topic and you just keep saying it. It's like taking a hammer and just nailing it further and further into someone's head every time you say it. Well there's one word I don't understand why it's spelled a certain way it's spelled. Colonel? No, the word a lot. People always call me out for that word. Oh, same two separate words. Yeah, but it should be one because- I totally agree. A lot? It should be one. There is also- There's so many people who like call me out for it. They're like, are you retarded? It's a lot. Well there is another word. There is the word to a lot. Exactly! That's another point. I'm like, what about a fucking lot where you park your car or put shit? A lot? Yeah. A lot. It's like, yeah, but it's a lot for a lot of stuff. It feels like, you know, this is why they fucking English language needs a little tweaking. A word I always misspell. I've been misspelling my entire life is weird. Weird? I mix up the I and the E. Yeah. Really? It's like, yeah, it's wired. I spell it like W I E R D and it's E I. But it just doesn't look right to me. The funny thing about the word weird, this is gonna be super nerdy, is that the old English spellings are like W Y E R D. Like there's so many different spellings of the word weird. So you can't really blame, can't blame Jeff. So people, people out in movie land, if you can put in your weird words and like words that are spelled weird, put them in the comments section. Cause I'm curious to see more. I have one which is very notorious. Which one? Spell tongue. I fucking hate the word tongue. Okay, get your spelling shit figured out. Everybody does. Oxford. Whoever wrote tongue. Can't do you acting in an Oxford. Deborah called me up for spelling the word ridiculous wrong for, he said, oh yeah, you've been spelling that wrong for the last decade. I kept spelling that wrong. Oh, do you spell it with an E? Yes. Oh no. I didn't realize. I didn't realize. Do you know how I used ridiculous? Do you know how I used to spell rough? Don't. Don't even. Don't even. Are you? No, don't. No, you didn't. Like yes, and you watch, that's because you watch Simpsons, you see Duff Beer and you're like that's rough. No, it's not it. It's because it's so much easier to spell it than what the actual word is. Cause it's like through though rough. And you don't think of that. They're just like rough. It's just like, are you okay? It's like, no, it's like you were speaking. You watch Simpsons, it's like kids who learn spelling from like Tom and Jerry. Like when you see like they're really poorly written letters and you're like trying to like, they spell cat with a cane shit. I do it so much too. And I always, and this is something I shouldn't be doing. And it's, I learned eventually that there are and there is, I've learned that I've mastered that sometimes I fuck up or for the most part, I can figure it out. But now I lose my fucking mind and put commas everywhere. I don't even know where commas is. I say a word comma, word comma, comma at a random. It's like, that's where the period goes and then you do a capital letter. I'm like, no, that's still a run on sentence. There's commas to go. There's people that overuse comma, underuse commas. There's people who use quotes too much. They just start quoting random words in their sentences for no reason. Oh yeah. This is like, this is like saying like I was going to the store to get. I was going to the store. It's like, what the fuck are you doing? He literally went to the store though.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:20.972 --> 0:03:21.816]: 
  I knew better.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:28.904 --> 0:03:30.456]: 
  Oh yeah, there's like a hundred English...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:49.710 --> 0:03:50.132]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:51.735 --> 0:03:54.182]: 
  That's two separate words.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:55.127 --> 0:03:55.937]: 
  I totally agree.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:57.675 --> 0:03:58.924]: 
  There is also-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:02.417 --> 0:04:03.784]: 
  Well, there is another word.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:05.995 --> 0:04:06.771]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:07.817 --> 0:04:08.948]: 
  like to allocate.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:12.795 --> 0:04:14.112]: 
  Yeah, aim lots.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:23.832 --> 0:04:25.924]: 
  Weird. I mix up the...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:27.089 --> 0:04:28.590]: 
  Really? That's like he gets wired.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:53.329 --> 0:04:54.747]: 
  I'm curious to see more.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:56.232 --> 0:04:56.502]: 
  which one?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:56.502 --> 0:04:57.413]: 
  Bill Tong.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:00.720 --> 0:05:01.007]: 
  every

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:02.509 --> 0:05:05.952]: 
  Whoever wrote tongue. You can do your act together. Oxford.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:09.529 --> 0:05:10.187]: 
  He said, oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:11.554 --> 0:05:12.094]: 
  Aqui, aqui.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:12.921 --> 0:05:13.394]: 
  Oh, do you s-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:13.984 --> 0:05:14.946]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:16.279 --> 0:05:16.397]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:22.354 --> 0:05:22.995]: 
  I don't even know

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:22.995 --> 0:05:23.991]: 
  Don't even

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:23.991 --> 0:05:27.417]: 
  No, don't, don't, don't, don't. No, you didn't.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:25.442 --> 0:05:25.949]: 
  No, I don't.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:41.001 --> 0:05:45.456]: 
  think of that and they're just like, what, is this already on your way? It's like, yeah, no, it's like, you were saying.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:53.607 --> 0:05:54.315]: 
  Damn shit.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:19.088 --> 0:06:19.999]: 
  There's people that over here.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:21.822 --> 0:06:22.514]: 
  I owe you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:22.109 --> 0:06:22.497]: 
  over you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:26.564 --> 0:06:26.952]: 
  Oh yeah, this is it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:29.348 --> 0:06:30.006]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:30.006 --> 0:06:31.626]: 
  It was going.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:31.626 --> 0:06:32.267]: 
  Store

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:32.267 --> 0:06:33.989]: 
  What the fuck are you doing?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:36.334 --> 0:08:44.618]: 
  They say that it's like a buildup, like I was going to the store and guess what I ran into. It's like, were you at home? It's so... The other thing I find kind of strange is that how the English language has certain words that are spelled the exact same way. Yes! But they just choose it for an ounce of difference. Yeah! You know, like Yale University is jail. It's spelled the exact same way. Are you serious? Yes. Wait, what? No, it's not. Yes, it is. What? I thought Yale was... Spell Yale and spell jail. Oh, no. J-A-I-L. Yeah. Oh, yeah. What the fuck? What? I thought it was Y-A-L-E. No, it is. What? Chad's just... Chad's being German. He's being Swiss-German. No, it's not. But I got it. I got it right. He just spelling trolled you, dude. No, you got it. No, I didn't troll him. He got it. He definitely won that fucking fifth grade spelling game. I won that fucking fifth grade spelling game. But there's also regional dialects. Like, I get upset at my family members. Like, I say... Carwash. Thank you. Rather than... There's people in upper New York state that'll say carwash. Carwash? Yes. Yes. I was just talking to you about that. Or water versus water. Like, a lot of my family members say water instead of water. Right. You know, like, Pokemon? I always say Pokemon. And I can't help it. It's not a word, though. Like, Pokemon. But the term is people are supposed to say Pokemon because it's pocket monsters? Yeah. But I say fucking Pokemon. Like, Poke. I say Pokemon. But it's not... It's Pokemon. Like, pocket. But it's Poke. It's so weird. You and I hate the word... You say Mario. Yeah. And I say Mario. I've never said Mario. You and Tom say Mario. Yeah. I say Mario. But it's like, you mean the same fucking thing. But you know how wrong that is, right? Like, it's not M-E-R-I-O. Because it would be like M-A-R-R-I-O. I don't say Mario. I say Mario. Yeah, Mario. Yeah. Like, Merry Christmas. That's what the name. But then it would be spelled M-E-R-R-I-O. The only thing that I would think was passable besides Mario would be Mario. Like, Pat. Mario. But it's Italian. You have to... Mario. Yeah. Mario. Yeah, that's the correct. Every time you say Mario, you're Italian accent. He says Mario. You disrespect. You always added an Italian accent. He says Mario. He doesn't say Mario. He says Mario. That's Luigi, actually. Luigi says Mario. He doesn't say Mario. He's like, Mario! He's like, Mario! Alright, wait.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:48.889 --> 0:06:49.514]: 
  Yes!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:54.863 --> 0:06:55.977]: 
  You're saying the same way? Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:57.006 --> 0:06:57.732]: 
  Yes it is.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:02.710 --> 0:07:03.216]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:03.216 --> 0:07:06.389]: 
  Yeah, yeah. What the fuck? I need a moment. What?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:10.995 --> 0:07:13.493]: 
  German. He's being Swiss German.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:11.974 --> 0:07:11.991]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:13.493 --> 0:07:21.829]: 
  But I got it He just spelling trolled you dude No I didn't troll him, he got it I won that fucking fifth grade spelling

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:15.450 --> 0:07:15.940]: 
  He just

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:27.398 --> 0:07:28.275]: 
  rather than

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:32.055 --> 0:07:34.941]: 
  Yes, I was just talking to you about that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:34.941 --> 0:07:36.105]: 
  talking to me water

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:54.297 --> 0:07:54.567]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:56.271 --> 0:07:59.764]: 
  You say Mario, and I say Mario, I've never said Mario. You and Tom say Mario.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:00.119 --> 0:08:04.017]: 
  I say Mario, but it's like you mean but you know how wrong that is right like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:06.126 --> 0:08:10.632]: 
  Because it would be like M-A-R-R-I-O. I don't say Mario. I say Mario. Yeah, Mario. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:06.430 --> 0:08:06.987]: 
  would be like M

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:13.163 --> 0:08:14.277]: 
  But then if we spell...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:20.841 --> 0:08:23.119]: 
  It's Italian, you have to

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:23.119 --> 0:08:24.857]: 
  Mario. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:27.152 --> 0:08:32.822]: 
  You say Mary here Italian accent. He says Mario. You disrespect the former. I wish you always had an Italian accent. He says,

I fucking I'd be pissed kind

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:54.023 --> 0:11:58.529]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:37.585 --> 0:13:57.987]: 
  You liar. Honky. I don't know. I don't know. Who fucking cares? When someone says I'm wrong. That sets me off. I don't realize it until much later. Then I'm like, oh well. I always thought, I see, cause I thought it was Olaf. I thought that was the word that said you off Olaf. No, that's just, that's just a waste of letters.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:40.504 --> 0:13:41.955]: 
  I don't know, I don't know. What do you mean?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:46.765 --> 0:13:47.153]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:54.409 --> 0:13:55.422]: 
  Oh, love.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:59.084 --> 0:15:39.304]: 
  That's not saying anyone, huh? Ha ha ha ha ha ha What about you, Shed? Human. Oh my god. You know, I thought you guys were asking a real question. It's like, people got you an edge lord. Edge lord. Human. What did you just call me? Edge lord. What about a meme prince? I just got a meme out of here. Get out of here. With your big ol' smile. Okay. You can't hide it. So we pretty much knocked the fucking dictionary off about words. You know, I think that the thing about words that really bothers me more than anything else is the people that care so much that they feel the need. Yes. It's not even the needed corrector. Yeah, okay look. It's like, people want to correct you, that's one thing, okay? It's like, oh, you know, like they mention it in passing. You know, that's one thing. But when I feel like they straight up climb up like 40 steps to the top of their pedestal, their ivory pedestal, like they're the fucking king of words. Yeah. It's just like, dude, seriously, who fucking cares? It's like- King of word mountain. Yeah. When I make a post or something. Yeah. I know it's weird where all this stuff comes from. It's Twitter where I have to spell. There's hardly any good stuff. I purposefully misspell shit on Twitter. But on Twitter, I mean, I have 140 characters and you know, I'm not going to write complete sentences all the time. But when I'm like saying something like, oh, I really like this movie. I really like this game or I really like this or something or something's bothering me. And then somebody will be like a word asterisk or whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'm just like, dude, come on. I'm just trying to say something and I don't need a fucking grammar teacher to fucking be there. You're doing it like somebody's insulting you and you use it as like a- Right. Your asterisk and you fucking own them. But this isn't that case. I'm just trying to talk. This is the most teen girl thing I've ever done.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:06.424 --> 0:14:07.150]: 
  That's for real

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:13.140 --> 0:14:13.934]: 
  benefit us

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:51.025 --> 0:14:51.565]: 
  It's just like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:53.489 --> 0:14:53.961]: 
  It's like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:54.771 --> 0:14:55.210]: 
  When you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:01.977 --> 0:15:02.399]: 
  I perfect

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:18.818 --> 0:15:19.240]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:29.601 --> 0:15:29.939]: 
  Right.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:29.939 --> 0:15:31.710]: 
  your asterisk and you fucking

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:31.137 --> 0:15:32.436]: 
  and you fucking own them?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:32.436 --> 0:15:32.571]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:38.005 --> 0:15:42.645]: 
  Do you mean owner or pun them? P-Pun? P-Pun? Not like own.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:40.941 --> 0:15:56.820]: 
  I like own was always lame each sorry you were saying I was saying this is like the most teen girl thing that goes through my brain But like when I post I say I post these art on Twitter and I say something and then immediately gets a bunch of favorites and retweets And then I noticed the misspelling yeah, and I'm sick

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:45.092 --> 0:15:45.683]: 
  이거 startled me

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:55.386 --> 0:15:56.078]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:56.820 --> 0:15:59.504]: 
  Fuck!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:59.504 --> 0:16:15.197]: 
  Sometimes when I write comic panels and I crop something, put it as a preview, people can check out the site. And that part where I crop, it's misspelled and it's saying something really cringey. It makes you look like I'm autistic. I'm like, what happened to the delete button? I'm like, gghh!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:08.937 --> 0:16:10.455]: 
  The thing's up really crazy.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:12.750 --> 0:16:14.438]: 
  I'm here for the delete button.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:16.277 --> 0:17:22.208]: 
  You know, there's a real easy solution to that. It's do a lot of misspellings intentionally all the time. I do. So when you actually write something and misspell something, you can just chalk it up to being a shitty speller. I went through this weird phase where I was capitalizing words constantly. Does anyone- It was just a phase? It was a phase. What does that mean? It passed by. I was writing a letter to my grandma. And you know how on the computer, I generally like, I don't capitalize words and I don't capitalize names. I'm sorry, I always forget. Like, I try to capitalize specific words. But when I was writing to my fucking grandma, it looked like a psycho wrote it. I was writing it and I had every single other word capitalized. I had T's and random E's capitalized and I'm like, she's gonna look at this and like, think I'm troubled. Because I can't fucking- and not only that, I didn't know what to write. She's gonna circle every capitalized letter and try to like spell out what you really meant. I was so- Rearrange all the letters into choruses. Yeah, so I'm like, hi, grandma. It's been a while and like everything is capital except for Ben and hi. And she's just like, like, she'll look at this and be like, what the fuck? I would love to see those letters and mail them to police. And not only that, but- The forensic sky's like, we have to find this man immediately.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:28.005 --> 0:16:28.309]: 
  I went

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:31.583 --> 0:16:32.123]: 
  mais alors...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:33.051 --> 0:16:34.705]: 
  What do you mean? What does that mean?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:03.780 --> 0:17:04.337]: 
  That's what we meant.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:06.987 --> 0:17:07.105]: 
  I'm

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:08.387 --> 0:17:08.843]: 
  Wow.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:18.984 --> 0:17:19.608]: 
  Really, that will make it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:23.001 --> 0:20:14.940]: 
  Not only that, but I can't like, write on the straight lines of the shit I like craving, and it's like, I haven't done this in so long. He's writing like spirals and shit. Of course, he's kind of like a scary serial killer, but he hasn't actually heard anybody yet. No, I can't. I- I- I'm like the- the starting out, the first signs of like, a crazy- But do you mean like, that guy who ate those two kids and then like, wrote a letter to their parents, how he enjoyed eating them, but he's sorry? What? I wasn't thinking of that example specifically. What? When did that happen? I forgot his name, something with fish as the last name. And he like- Phil? No, no, no, Phil Fish. That's the only name that comes to my mind. He got really angry on Twitter, because people were making fun of his game. They said it wasn't- they said it wasn't as good as he thought it was. He got so angry, he deleted his Twitter account, went out and ate two kids. That made a game about it. A fucking text adventure. No, but he wrote like a letter to their parents, describing how like, he enjoyed the boys' ass the most. Like when he ate it. No. No, this is real. This is real. Why do you keep pointing to Jeff? I know that Jeff enjoys good food. You know what, speaking about restaurants, I- There's not like spy vs. spy, I'd say. I talk to this to you, Mick, and this is something that bothers me. It's almost like a Seinfeld fucking Larry David moment. Yeah. It was just- it's always something on the back of your mind that you're just like, why does this happen? Like you go to a restaurant and let's say you order something like fucking spaghetti or steaks or stuff that's gonna get all over your face. Right. It's not because you're a messy eater, it's just there's sauce on everything. There's a lot of stuff going on, yeah. And you give you one fucking napkin. Yes. And it's just like, here's your water, here's your napkin, and then they leave. And it's just like, by the end of it, your napkin is just cut brown and orange. You don't want people to see it, and you're rubbing gunk on your face again because you're still fucking using the same napkin. Every corner of the napkin's eaten up. So if you had to take a shit and they just hand you like one single sheet and tore the paper and they're like, alright, good luck. And I would be like, no, give me four at least. You don't know what happens after this. Some restaurants are definitely criminally under napkin, yeah. Yes, and I know- I mean, when you ask for it, you feel like such a slob. It's not even like a thick, hardy napkin. It's a very thin, like, cheap read. You know the fucking diners? Yeah, it's like toilet paper. Yeah. And they put it on the table, and you're just like, this is- I could go to Dunkin Donuts down the street and get more like, satisfaction out of there fucking napkins. You ask for another napkin, everyone in the restaurant just like, looks at you and like, ugh. That's the thing too. They're all disgusted at you. The manager comes by with a towel and's like, ugh, here you go. That really is like hilarious. Put yourself up. Put yourself up. Just tell out of here. It is, and it's something that bothers me. But it bothers me, and it should bother everybody because when you eat food, you're not like, one napkin. Well, you put one in your fucking lap if you got one. I don't know, have you ever seen- Every single time you see those movies of like, those dainty gentlemen, like in those English movies, it's like they have one little handkerchief, and they have like, one finger that is dabbed the corners of their mouths. What kind of movies do you watch? Fucking Downton Abbey, the show. Not one of these. That one fucking thing. Yeah, one finger. They're glowing guys, you like that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:28.823 --> 0:17:28.840]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:46.964 --> 0:17:50.524]: 
  Oh, the sticking of that example specifically.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:54.490 --> 0:17:55.536]: 
  Phil?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:58.911 --> 0:17:59.265]: 
  You gotta

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:01.594 --> 0:18:01.999]: 
  Hey, hey, hey.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:01.999 --> 0:18:02.742]: 
  They said it wasn't...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:04.379 --> 0:18:04.919]: 
  it was.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:07.804 --> 0:18:08.749]: 
  Kids.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:28.037 --> 0:18:28.814]: 
  I talked to this.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:29.927 --> 0:18:30.130]: 
  What's up?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:45.334 --> 0:18:46.937]: 
  eat her it's just there's sauce and all

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:46.937 --> 0:18:48.186]: 
  What's going on?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:50.616 --> 0:18:50.970]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:06.968 --> 0:19:09.094]: 
  She's in the toilet paper and they're like, alright, good luck.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:12.435 --> 0:19:12.925]: 
  for the rest of the week.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:15.895 --> 0:19:17.464]: 
  Yes, and I know, and maybe.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:21.329 --> 0:19:23.370]: 
  It's a very thin

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:23.370 --> 0:19:24.248]: 
  You know the fucking time?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:25.632 --> 0:19:25.834]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:27.842 --> 0:19:29.175]: 
  You know, I could just disintegrate.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:32.078 --> 0:19:32.179]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:32.112 --> 0:19:32.247]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:35.622 --> 0:19:36.584]: 
  That's a thing too.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:37.360 --> 0:19:37.950]: 
  And I know

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:39.756 --> 0:19:44.059]: 
  Here you go. That really is like a lary. Put yourself up, put yourself up. I'm just out of here.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:44.059 --> 0:19:47.586]: 
  It's like this tiny little thing. But it bothers me and it should bother everyone.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:53.627 --> 0:19:54.302]: 
  I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:08.494 --> 0:20:10.300]: 
  to show not the movie.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:11.481 --> 0:20]: 
  I don't even know.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20 --> 0:20:13.776]: 
  finger

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:15.902 --> 0:21:09.683]: 
  I pulled my head up from their lap just so I can catch those scenes. My favorite scenes. I was watching a porno and a girl got splashed and the face would come and then a napkin came in and dropped her face while she's just still enjoying her going. I like it if it just came up from the bottom of the screen just like a finger puppet. Somebody take a porno of a girl getting a facial and do one of those Photoshop tricks where they're putting napkins on their face afterwards. No, the thing they do most in those often, the thing that I notice most is they just do a cut away and it's just gone. Like clearly there was a cut here and then everyone got cleaned up. The makeup's back on, the cushions are all back on the couch, everything got reset just for the end. I'm usually turning the porno off once the cums start to splot. Are you a cumapho? I don't like when they're splattered. That's just okay. So tell us, sorry, Jeff, why are you disgusted by nature? Just leave me alone.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:40.911 --> 0:20:41.316]: 
  No, the

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:42.295 --> 0:20:43.274]: 
  in those office.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:53.601 --> 0:20:55.592]: 
  Like everything got reset just for the end.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:05.987 --> 0:21:06.240]: 
  Sorry.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:06.021 --> 0:21:06.224]: 
  All right.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:11.573 --> 0:25:40.830]: 
  I don't care anymore. Okay. Cory, your trip. How was your trip? I derailed it. Well, first of all, I want to do an disclaimer. I might yell because I'm fairly angry about this trip, but I'm angry about certain things and I'm angry about services I accepted and I'm angry that they still do it this way, but I'll get into that. But I'm just a disclaimer, I may get angry. I'm very curious. So me and Lexi, we went to Missouri to visit my mom. She's like a recent like Seventh Day Venice, is that what it's called? Maybe she believes everything in the Bible. She believes there's going to be a thing in the future where they're going to pass a law where you have to go to Sunday church or they're going to... Basically you're not going to be able to buy or sell. So you're not going to be able to be a human being. You're basically like, you're going to go Sunday? Well you're grounded from life that day. What the hell happens on the grounded day? Well, you can't buy or sell and you're like... She also says that Jesus will come down and he'll be like touching people and like, you know, healing them, but Jesus is not supposed to touch the ground. His feet never touch the ground. And if he does, that's Satan. This is all stuff my mom taught me. And I learned about the story of Adam and Eve because I never knew it. If he's wearing Nike sneakers and they have very thick soles, does that count as you touching the ground? Well if he's touching the ground and he's not on his fucking like youth cloud, then yes. I would love to see him. Wait, are you saying if he's not in the cloud like the Mario guys who like throw the spiky ball things at you? He'll come down with angels upon him and he won't touch the ground because he, because it, the ground is... The other fishing rod? He doesn't touch ground. He's like above ground because he's sacred so he doesn't want to touch. The Satan has corrupted earth. What was so evil about the ground now? Satan has corrupted earth and he won't touch ground. Got it. So what if Satan though isn't touching ground? Satan touches ground. He controls earth. He can't. This is all stuff I learned from my mom. How much about Satan is literally, how much is actually in the box? I've read that there's not really that much about hell and Satan really even in the Bible. No, she says that it's just sort of made up as like somebody read Dante's Inferno and they're like this is what hell is now. But my mom believes there isn't a heaven in hell. What happens is you're corrupted by Satan and you believe that there's a heaven in hell. But what really happens is you're kept there until the rapture and you're left there with Satan. You don't go anywhere. Like you stay there and the ones who are good are brought to the utopia where everything is perfect and pure. That's what she believes. And I was like, okay, let's get this stuff out. I don't know. I don't even like, she's sending me pamphlets with golden cities and people in white coats laying with lions. Sounds a little insane if you ask me. I was just saying the pamphlets. I was going to say that sounds a little sacrilegious to lay with a lion. That sounds very sexy. Well, it's like, no, it's like the lions wear the lions eat because they say the reason why there's murder, death, famine, all this stuff is because Adam or Eve ate the apple and tricked Adam into eating it too. She's trying to convince it over and that costs it. She's actually trying to send you pamphlets that are convincing you. Well, she thinks the Bible is real and I just think it's a book of morals. Are you sure she's not just lying? Well, here's the thing. And it's kind of funny because I was watching Cable Guy with Lexi. There's this scene where the cable cuts and all these people are sitting there in the fucking TV dinners and in their football jerseys ready to watch that bar, you know, that cliche thing where everyone's at the bar. What happens is there's this one guy who's watching TV and he's just like, the TV goes out. He goes to a side and there's a book and he grabs a book and starts reading it. And that's exactly how my mom became into religion, how she is now. The TV went out and she started reading the Bible. And then she was converted. And she looked in, and my mom's a conspiracy theorist, so she looks into theories and so she sees stuff in the Bible and she sees stuff that people say on DVDs about real life and she's like, it's all true. It's all true. It's so weird because I feel like, I mean, certain conspiracies, I feel like, you know, you can see the ridiculous nature of this, but you can also see the tie-in with certain things, you know what I mean? But with a lot of religious stuff, I feel like the amount of information opposing the logical connections that you could possibly make for religion, I feel like there's just such a disproportionate balance. You could pull out a few facts here and there and tie them together to justify certain, know-as-arcs is up in some fucking mountain or whatever, but you could, there's like billions of facts that would totally just wash that away. That's a metaphor, you know, like that? They would wash away in a flood of fucking logic. People, the conspiracy people, they love knowing something you don't. They love knowing secrets. And they love passing it on to you, so it's like, oh, you didn't know this? You don't know anything about it.

  Dr. Mead people. You know, this is where Noah's Ark is, you know. I see this weird looking rock on the top of this mountain, you know.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:43.497 --> 0:25:44.442]: 
  looking rock at the top of this.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:45.437 --> 0:31:16.508]: 
  And they feel they feel like you know, well, I know you know, we believe but I know it they don't It's you know, what's weird though is like a lot of times when they when they get get information like that when it doesn't change their minds Like you know like there was all of like the every single time there's the apocalypse guys or like the world-ender guys We're talking about oh, it's gonna end at this time on this day in this place and everybody gathers They all give this person a ton of money and they're all ready to die and it doesn't happen. They're like oh shit. Um, oh You know what I misread it. It's actually in 20. It's in another month or whatever It's like how how do people not just absolutely lose full credibility at that point It's like they believe so hard that even if you gave them even if you proved to them that what they thought was right is wrong They will still somehow spin it to continue to believe I think what it really comes down to is people would like to think that there's more to life than what you have of course No, that yeah, yeah, I also believe it's a common thing that like the sensual nihilosage I can't say the word Sensualization of disaster centralization. No sense against the sense and sensational Sensationalism yeah of disaster. Yeah, I'm gonna say the word But that is like a common thing you see throughout humanity She's told me love making a sensation out of disaster She loves to short attention spans too because if you want to look up something interesting go to Wikipedia and look up The amount of end of the world dates that have been announced over the last few centuries. There's hundreds of them hundreds Most recent one 2012 I believe there was ones even after that There's probably one in two thousand because then they were trying to say that the calculations were wrong due to leap years or whatever the fuck There was that goof there was that goofy. Yeah, not too long. There's a guy who based You know these guys who somehow figure out math equations from the Bible they a they put together dates and numbers. Yeah, somehow Oh, it's like June 6th. Yeah, because the Hebrew language is based on numbers Yeah, and they'll try to use like topical events to prove it like see you follow this trail of events of wars that happened in the mid-east People around here they used to have this date shit written on the side of the van like the end of the world is coming this date And they are these days of these followers they sell all their belongings And they're like well, I'm just gonna wait a few weeks and that'll be that and nothing happens Then you see that van a year later, and he's painted over one of the numbers with a new number Yeah, exactly You're talking about your mom you were talking about her religious conversion Yeah, and my my what the you're at the dinner table, and she just couldn't stop talking about reptile Obama Yeah, but my stepdad My stepdad also like he he's a I don't know what you call it, but it's like a new type of thing It's like the new age kind of he believes in the new age faith. I think it's called It's not Jordan D level 7th day Venice already sound pretty out there for me Yeah, I mean, but it's also like this it's to give you a general idea Yeah, what she she was so she believes that the first day is Sunday and the last day is Saturday And that's what she says was in the original Holy Bible and that has been completely Misconstrued by everybody else because of the Sabbath keep the Sabbath holy, which is Saturday. Yes, I heard that yeah And so that's why she goes to church on Saturday, and she's like because I don't want to be it's true I believe in everything that has been changed that is very that is actually a fact though Let's see like when people make changes like that what where are you saying to everyone who was doing it before like everyone before the Billions of people before you were all wrong. Well, the thing is what happened was it was I'm saying it kind of undermines the Other religious people that I guess you'd kind of consider yourself Well, this goes back in the fucking like the Renaissance right crusades and shit where they changed it like Sunday because like and the hell did the Seven-day week even start of all like the things and because God created earth and heavens and hells or but God because there's a lot of like what it was like to this old Nordic gods like Thor and all those like Thursday was oh, yeah Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, so that existed before the Christianity look, I don't know exactly what it is and I am believe it or not completely ignorant to the idea of what I'm talking about But this is what I was told. Oh, no, no, and I may be a little foggy and I may be getting subsurrant So people in the comments will I actually think that's more interesting to hear not their side of the story But to hear what you heard like you're sitting there across the dinner table. Yeah inundated with this shit I'm curious what you actually walk away with this knowledge interesting even though. I know it's all religious bullshit I'm really interested in it. Yeah, no like Pamphlets I got pamphlets and like DVDs like the new war of order and stuff and she has DVDs that talk about Years of stuff like you know with the Crusades where they like the they kill people who didn't believe in religion Yeah, and then they made something a lot of Muslims. Yeah, and that's like they created like all these like religious figures And then people started like ruin fucking up religion and like, you know like how there's also this other thing Okay, I'm gonna get into another story. There's a guy. I think his name was Paul Where he saw a woman who was white who had 12 stars around her head who came down from the heavens Covered in light who was pregnant and then a three-headed dragon was going to eat her and did eat her He wrote it down on like tombs or whatever the fucking column and he gave them to the people and that like like people like the Catholic Catholicism Those people like that believe that um in Mary and stuff That's the reason why they like kind of believe in Mary because she came down that was pregnant and they saw that No, the Mary came down they saw so Catholicism is based off like they think that's Jesus like that

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:51.293 --> 0:25:53.014]: 
  It's even what's weird though is like a lot of times

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:36.653 --> 0:26:36.788]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:36.788 --> 0:26:37.935]: 
  That's that, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:45.917 --> 0:26:47.672]: 
  It's a sensation.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:50.288 --> 0:26:51.857]: 
  Yeah, I shouldn't say the word.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:54.861 --> 0:26:54.962]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:07.973 --> 0:27:08.783]: 
  hundreds

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:10.791 --> 0:27:13.508]: 
  There was ones even after that there's probably one in two thousand because

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:16.731 --> 0:27:17.322]: 
  There was that

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:26.012 --> 0:27:26.299]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:28.054 --> 0:27:29.151]: 
  Yeah, because the heat

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:30.720 --> 0:27:32.459]: 
  Yeah and they'll try to use like topical

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:37.184 --> 0:27:38.112]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:13.521 --> 0:31:15.445]: 
  Where does the three-headed dragon come in?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:15.445 --> 0:31:18.364]: 
  Where's the 12-starred woman come from?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:18.128 --> 0:38:20.307]: 
  That's she I don't know it sounds like a like a devil may cry boss It sounds crazy, but I was told all this stuff at like literally like blast day And I was just like does she go to one of those mega churches or is it a regular sized church? It's like an indie church where people go to church. It's like a hipster church It's like a smaller church. It's not the one with the pastor and like a private helicopter Yeah, no, they got a food banquet everybody talks to each other like yeah, we know we're at the exclusive Saturday church So it's like I mean like I'm on Sunday they see people going to church They just look at them scoff and like nudge each other like look at those guys You know like you know like Mary hushed Mary birth Jesus in like the crib or whatever in the Yeah, with all the animals. Yeah, like all those like Joseph and fucking people around here Mary they saw the pregnant woman who came down from the sky was Mary in the future And that's why they see Mary as a prophet, but she's not and you're in another rule is you're not supposed to have false idols So like Mary and all that stuff is considered a false idol. She's not originally you're supposed to believe in Jesus only dude Captain of his quidditch to you this is this is the see this is what I wish was back re-inducted into religion This is the sad part back in like Roman times did all these incredible gods. They were all yeah, heady assholes and they were interesting Yeah, they were fighting that weaknesses and they were so jealous and hate Collect them on baseball cards. You know, who's your favorite guy every kid had their favorite Like they threw lightning or like they're a sex god or a sun god That's true. Yeah, they had gods for literally every sensation cool. I mean it's still cool Like yeah, they did like inner inner breeding as well Like they breed with animals and like spirit solace and you have like half god spirit things and all So shit. Yeah, they traded this awesomeness for this depressing boring guy's big old white bearded dude It's depressing asshole on a one cross. Yeah, he was You know the Christian guys the first this is all it was all about the patriarch that but this is also something I learned from the movie I'm not saying I learned it and take it as actual knowledge This is something it was told me it told me the reason why he killed himself on the cross is obviously to release themselves with their sin Everybody knows that right but prior they called Jesus like he's like a lamb or something He's like determines like lamb. Yeah, his lambs are helpless and they used to sacrifice animals before Jesus sacrifice himself Adam and Eve used to sacrifice animals because it was like because they sinned they had to continue to sin and Sacrificing animals was what they did before Jesus killed himself and that's when everybody could start praying because before that God I guess he forgot that Jesus maybe instead of waiting 400 years that maybe you should do something I want to know what kind of bullshit rule that is some powerful entities like I'll actually allows a person to You know take on like a big a debt collector like here you early sinful assholes You can die, you know, you can wipe this slate clean if you kill you die on this girl Jeff that's that's what he does we did easier than talking to his own son He's here then that's what he did to his own son turning into people from ribs. Yeah, you know what? Yeah, you know something really bothers me because everybody die. They're cool No, but that's that's actually wrong because Jesus is God He knew he was the son of God and he knew he was going to have it was a suicide mission It was a suicide with no consequence From heaven right back up for eternity. Yeah, but keep in mind. This is from somebody who kind of gets knowledge What they said that's all one it's all right the father the God hold the Holy Spirit is still Jesus bad Who the fuck is the Holy Ghost by the way? The reason why I'm Christmas Reason why they sacrifice Jesus is because after Adam and Eve like they created you created Adam even they sinned by eating the apple When he told him not to and that started like death and famine and all that shit He he wanted to keep in touch because you know he created this world for all these people and then they fucked up in the first hour And he's like well shit I guess I gotta fucking eventually open up to them again And that's why he said kill the animals to stay in touch But then like I guess that's what he said kill Jesus So if you pray for Jesus after he gave up his own son Just like they gave up everything because they sinned and stuff so he was trying to be human terry in so yeah But here's the other interesting thing is that Jesus had to die in order for the slate to be cleaned right? He needed to be killed by by his fellow there is still sin But in order for you to go to heaven He's kind of like your vessel right but he needed to die Yeah, so your purpose like if anything they were supposed to kill him that was always the goal But they had to kill you know what the most fucked up part about that is he always knew they were gonna take the apple in the first place Yeah, he put it. Oh, I know that whole knowing he's just having fun Like if that if you really would believe in that God is just kind of a prick. He's like I'm bored. Let's just fuck around here Yeah, I don't know But what happened was like Satan was was casted from heaven from the great war because he was like his like right-hand man And he was forcing angels so he had like millions of angels from heaven And he was the one who shape-shift into like the lizard monster thing Yes, the apple and it was really that's what they say they say like Satan was the one Satan was the first altered Fooled the humans because humans the reason why humans even do that stuff is because they were given like consciousness like thought like they were Born to think and it's like all you know like it wasn't called the free will yes Yes, that's what I was this I know wasn't thinker consciousness, but it was free will they were given the free will to do something And that's why they ate the apple because they were built with flaws Like that's all I really like learned and I like I said I looked at the pamphlet and it basically that pamphlet thing You know are there any parts of this pamphlet that you think would be good to be read read this one This is what happens after you die find something that's interesting in there, but I'll be one of those was like about a city in space That's the one that's the one like see that's called it's literally called city in space It's like one of those utopia novels you read about everything is perfect But you have to look at this but this is what my mom believes will happen when we die but Chad find it Jeff read it Okay. Yeah. Yeah, you're Jeff you read it whenever you find such a lovely narrative If you'd like me to I would basically The other one real fast. Let me let me tell you something Can I first personally apologize for prior podcast because I didn't know much about religion I was completely ignorant to all religion and I've learned a lot about This I've learned a lot about it and space city in three headed dragon three headed dragon is actually say oh that is Satan Yeah, it was a representation of Satan. It's like if fucking God was playing charades with this fucking crazy old guy It was on a mountain carving into stuff and he went up to him and put a straight in front of me It's like give me an egg me need he fucking gives it to him like that And he does this and he's like this is heaven and this is hell basically was a representation of that I love these pamphlets where they you know, it's a bunch of questions saying, you know, what if I don't what if what if I don't believe in the Bible? Yeah, yeah, really airs in the body read it. It's basically like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:19.495 --> 0:31:19.917]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:50.667 --> 0:36:51.038]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:51.038 --> 0:36:51.679]: 
  Yes!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:05.972 --> 0:37:06.411]: 
  Are there any

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:12.908 --> 0:37:13.414]: 
  I'll be

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:15.794 --> 0:37:16.418]: 
  That's the way.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:24.923 --> 0:37:25.429]: 
  We die.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:29.159 --> 0:37:30.576]: 
  You find such a lovely

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:31.875 --> 0:37:35.605]: 
  But basically... Hit me the other one real fast. Let me tell you something.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:47.114 --> 0:37:48.059]: 
  Hey, Tetris!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:17.235 --> 0:38:18.501]: 
  Yeah, read it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:18.501 --> 0:38:19.649]: 
  Really, really, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:20.982 --> 0:39:06.021]: 
  It's like, why can't I trust the Bible? And the answer is like, you can trust the Bible because the Bible's true. Right, that's it. What does the Bible claim about itself? Answer. It claims to be inspired. It was written by men who were guided by the Holy Ghost. It cannot be broken or proven untrue. It can't be? Apparently not. It can't be. And that's the answer? No, sir, nope. Ha ha ha ha. I just love how they try to rope you in with like a, what if I had an argument with you, Shed? And you're like, where did you get the information? And I said, it's the information I gave you and it can't be proven otherwise. That's like, I just stood up and walked away. It's gibberish. It doesn't mean anything. You wouldn't follow me? You wouldn't be devoted to me after stopping that Knowledge Bomb on you?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:57.263 --> 0:38:59.288]: 
  or gibberish.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:02.595 --> 0:39:03.692]: 
  You wouldn't be devoted to that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:05.481 --> 0:39]: 
  I like a political answer.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39 --> 0:39:43.264]: 
  You know, you're just saying something that makes you sound okay. He's like, this is a pretty interesting thing if Dev should read it. Our biblical health principles tuned to the 21st century mind. If people just followed the Bible, it says millions of alcoholics will become sober, respectable citizens. As if they're just not. You can immediately tell which audience this is for because there's a little thing here saying, there will be no use for crutches and wheelchairs in heaven. Accepting Christ in obeying scripture changes a broken, immoral, profane sinner into a loving, sober, pure Christian. Skeptics cannot explain this fact.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:26.625 --> 0:39:27.621]: 
  which audience

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:45.981 --> 0:41:05.496]: 
  I can't explain it. It's amazing. It's a fact too. They actually sound like, you know, like the Nazis are like just a very fascist regime. When they say, what will happen to sin and sinners? Answer, God will destroy all sin and sinners with fire. This fire will melt the earth and turn everything into ashes. What did I say? Then God will make a perfect new earth and the holy city will be its capture. Those who are pure will be brought back up to heaven and he will recreate earth again with no sin. Like no compromise, like destroy them all. He's just waiting for the right time to attack. Here, heaven will bring us the privilege of becoming friends with the Bible patriarchs and prophets. Like, oh, it's so sweet. You guys can chill out, play board games. See, I want to, if you believe in this kind of stuff, that's fine, okay? But what I'm saying is to hear all this stuff as somebody who's never heard this stuff before, it's definitely interesting. And I don't, it's like going back in time and being like, why does it rain? It's because Thor is angry and he's throwing thunders for those who don't understand. You just did it! What? They're throwing thunders at people. Yeah. That's the freaking additional S. First of all, you'd throw lightning bolts, not thunder. Thunder is the sound.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:07.969 --> 0:40:08.796]: 
  What did I say?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:18.752 --> 0:40:18.870]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:21.064 --> 0:40:21.368]: 
  He's just.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:22.667 --> 0:40:23.005]: 
  And here.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:50.562 --> 0:40:51.912]: 
  and he's growing funders for the...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:07.757 --> 0:47:29.942]: 
  The plural of thunder is thunder. It's wrong in so many ways. Sorry, I didn't mean to correct you. God, now I'm the asshole. It's fine, it's fine. Have a little asterisk, somebody. Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. People should start doing that. Asterisk, thunder? I'm sorry. It's my own fault for being a fool. I can't tell the difference between thunder and lightning. Or you love people, you are kind, you try to keep an open mind, you are willing to receive this information and judge it based on your own experience rather than just following it. I don't care how inaccurate your facts are, I don't think that makes you an idiot. I think that makes you the opposite. Thank you. You're welcome. You're cutie. So let's get out of the box. Let's go away from Missouri. Let's leave Missouri and let's talk about something. This is what I was gonna get mad about. Has anyone ever rode a Greyhound bus? I've never been on a Greyhound bus. I have. No, I have. You know, like most places how like you can go up to them on your phone and be like, here you see this, this is me and this is my ticket. And they're like, okay, you can get on the bus and like most places are like they can, this is like 2015. They scan it from your phone. Yeah, it's like digital almost everywhere. You can do that, you can't do that on Greyhound. You have to print it out and hand it to them and they have to be like this and then they have to see your ID. And all you're doing is getting on a fucking bus. You're not getting on a plane. They're not going through your pockets and checking to see if you have knives and guns. They're just like, and you see your ticket and your ID to make sure you're not lying to us. It's like, I already spent like hundreds of dollars to ride your fucking bus. Yeah, they're kind of a low-tech company aren't they? Yeah, their own fucking system is incompetent. They have these lines, right? You go to the fucking Greyhound place and they have these lines and there's like one through 30, no, there's like 16 through 30 and one through 16, right? They're fucking lines you're supposed to line up. You have your number at the top and you're supposed to go into that. You're supposed to get in line when they call your name. What did you have to take a bus to exactly? To go to Illinois. From the airport or? No, I took a Greyhound from Missouri to St. Louis and then got another Greyhound to get to Illinois. How long did that take? 10 hours. It was funny because me and Lexie printed off the tickets. We were like, oh, it's perfect. We're gonna get there in fucking four hours. It'd be great. But what actually ended up happening was they took us to fucking St. Louis and we sat in there for four hours because the only Greyhound out of fucking where I was from was at 7.45 PM and the Greyhound don't start up till 3 AM or whatever. So they're like, we're just gonna drop you off at St. Louis, chill out for four hours and we'll pick you up and it's like, what the fuck? I don't know exactly what part of St. Louis it is but has the highest crime rate in America. Does it actually? Yes. I mean, it's like how airports work. You get a layover, you have to wait for it. Yeah. I'm gonna assume it's worth a great... But it wasn't, I didn't realize that and it was the only one we could take. We could only take it at 7.45 PM. So we took it and we went there and we were there and there was this one dude. Like I got an iPad on my vacation in Missouri because last time I went there I didn't have anything. But I got an iPad. It was only like $250 and it's great. Like I love it. I've never had an iPhone before and I've never used it but I am using an iPad and it's awesome because I can fucking play games and that's another topic I wanted to talk about. We can talk about the later like free to play games because there's a model of that that I don't like but there's a model of that that I do like. Some of these companies hire psychologists to come up. They're pretty open about it too. They hire psychologists to come up with ways of developing these free to play games in order to manipulate people. But there's... To spend the most amount of money. No yet but there's good free to play games and then there's bad free to play games. Like for instance a good free to play game is something like Plants vs. Zombies. That's a really good free to play game. The first one and the second one. A bad free to play game is something like fucking like Night War or something where you do one move and wait for two hours. Or you wait for three days. It's all matter of perspective. Yeah, they're all built to suck as much money out as they can but... But something like Plants vs. Zombies, right? I didn't know there was a paying option. It's a free to pay. You're paying for like basically what they... You can unlock more things. Yeah, they just need up time. Yeah, that's what it mostly is. On most games it's a stilt thing. They'll bleed you stuff and then they'll say like but if you purchase this $50 pack you can go and play the full game basically. You can buy it. But the thing is there's games that don't do it so dastardly. Like I played this one mall game. It's like Little Mall Story or something. I really liked it. I thought it was a charming fun game and I'm a faggot who likes Tycoon games. So I was playing a mall Tycoon-ish type game and I was really getting into it. But what I wasn't getting into was waiting for two days when I post a building. Cause eventually you get to that point where it starts like stilting you and making it impossible. And they do it only after you've invested a certain amount of time and energy into it. But there's some games that don't do that. Like Plants vs. Zombies 2 is a game where you can basically play the full entire fucking game. You can put in 14 hours without paying a single dime. Yeah, you just... You can unlock everything. Yes. It just takes more time. But it's like if it's a game that's competent like that has like it feels like it's fun, then that's fine. I honestly think it would be fun designing a free to play game, but designing it in a way like Plants vs. Zombies where you don't insult the player by immediately stilting them. You fucking make it so they don't ever have to do that. It's just to really invest in the game and want to try other stuff, you put it there. Yeah. You should try a Fallout shelter on your iPad. I haven't. But I needed internet so I couldn't play it when I was in Missouri. I think that's also pretty clever. You don't have to... It's free to play, but you can see why you would want to pay. But that's what's genius about it. You can still play the full fucking game. Yeah, you can play. I got all... I got the full of all, then I never paid a single cent. And that has to be like from downloads. And I don't mind when people play ads and the thing because you can put ads in the corner or whatever. Just don't have video pop-up ads and shit like that. That gets annoying. Dude, the new Angry Birds, there's so many fucking issues with it like people are just so pissed at it because the first Angry Birds was a puzzle game. There were ways of using like one bird to like clear out an entire level to do the maximum amount of damage if you did the exact right thing. The thing with Angry Birds 2 is that there's a lot of randomly generated levels. There is kind of a pattern, but for the most part, it's not only randomly generated levels, but the characters, like the birds that you're given are all randomly generated as well. And that's cool. So what do you pay for? But it's a totally different game. You pay for extra lives. You would also pay for power-ups because what they did with this new one is one level isn't one level anymore. It's five levels in one level. So like you'll get through four, you're on the fifth one.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:13.782 --> 0:41:14.946]: 
  Now I'm the ass.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:16.701 --> 0:41:19.890]: 
  Have a little asterisk. Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. People should just stop.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:49.590 --> 0:41:49.709]: 
  So

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:03.192 --> 0:42:03.411]: 
  No, I

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:14.346 --> 0:42:16.455]: 
  2015 your phone yeah, it's like digital

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:16.590 --> 0:42:17.181]: 
  almost everywhere.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:40.148 --> 0:42:40.755]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:00.010 --> 0:43:00.179]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:40.493 --> 0:43:40.864]: 
  Was it that?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:44.205 --> 0:43:44.492]:

  that I don't.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:49.495 --> 0:44:50.490]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:05.796 --> 0:45:06.235]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:43.765 --> 0:45:44.490]: 
  But!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:44.490 --> 0:45:44.507]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:54.109 --> 0:45:54.160]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:58.227 --> 0:45:58.345]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:20.029 --> 0:46:20.350]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:20.991 --> 0:46:21.936]: 
  Yeah, fallout, Chelsea.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:22.611 --> 0:46:25.885]: 
  I haven't, but I needed internet so I couldn't play it when I was in Missouri.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:30.441 --> 0:46:30.846]: 
  But that's what I'm saying.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:32.989 --> 0:46:33.951]: 
  Yeah, you can play.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:02.166 --> 0:47:02.453]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:14.721 --> 0:47:16.155]: 
  So what do you pay for?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:29.942 --> 0:47:35.005]: 
  You need one more bird. Yeah. You need one more bird. Like, alive models.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:31.343 --> 0:52:49.200]: 
  Yeah, you need one more like all I've models and I've seen that in life I cannot stand free to play models that use live systems to it because it's very unfair Because they can sit there and crank up the difficulty at the last Oh, yeah, absolutely you over and then completely ruin your game You don't even expect there's who it and you're fucked. You're just like if you really want to see people Sorry, just really quick with angry birds, too I actually do play it because I just don't pay for anything But I do enjoy some of like the competitive parts of it. You don't have to it does definitely speed things Oh, no, definitely. It's interesting because that is such a great model to see just how blatantly they will use that system against you So like two three levels no problem pass through it No problem, and then there's the level right before you get like a free gift or something You might spend two or three days to actually beat that level and then on top of that What'll happen is if you are if you need one more bird you can play an ad yes And they'll give you one more bird, right? And a lot of times it won't be enough, but sometimes it is enough so it so it works So I always felt like with the ads they would give it to you in these circumstances if you run a lives You can watch an ad and they'll give you one more life, but then if you beat like three levels They just play an ad anyway. Yes I was playing this game it was a sonic iPhone game, but it's really good sonic iPhone game Is it the is it the runner one? Yes, I like that one actually fucking awesome that mechanic works really well Escape run yeah, but they do you get and there's like 52 fucking levels Yeah There's hundreds of outputs and the game resets after love it to it just keeps going and you get these little Companions that you can win after getting a certain amount of red coins and you can get really far But the problem is I was doing this thing where it was really like cheeky that they did it But I think it was also really clever But I wish it wouldn't happen every time I fucking do it now But you could play a video ad and then they would give you one of those like laser things or one of those drill things Right along with a bubble shield so you could get an extra life if you were on the last one Like you're on the four where if you get hit once you're dead Yeah, they would give you a bubble shield So you have an extra life basically and I did that and I exploited it But then they started playing ads and I didn't even get an option it just started playing ads What are the ads about they're just bullshit like stupid End of being ads for other iPhone games. Yeah, fuck and you know what it's like a circle jerking games It's like this inception of fucking iPhone games and not only that But a lot of times there's like the X to like click out of the ad Like they make the hitbox so tiny that like you'll try to pick the X and then it opens up the app store to download It just opens the app store. Yeah, yes. Yes. I'm always shutting the app store You're like something in an app appears. Yeah, I don't want that So what happens is is I think what they do is they what'll happen is if you open up some sites They'll have an ad that pops up on the site So if you go to like a mood of like a game review site Then they'll throw up an ad as soon as the page loads, right? But that ad eats up the whole screen and a lot of times you're thumbing through the site And so your fingers are pressing the screen clicking it You're not even clicking it so then it just takes you immediately and some of them will just open it up And like just shuts the browser down the app store So there's that site where they have like a hints and stuff or the information on bloodborne or dark souls that effecture or whatever It's called but they have it if you go on the mobile site a lot of times it automatically just shuts your browser down and opens up fucking the app store I'm ashamed to say I've actually dealt with people that wanna that was were advertising that on my site They say that they could do that. They're really shady like today they come on They're like yeah, you want to make some extra money out of your site. It's like how does $500 extra week sound They're like oh, it sounds pretty good like right what I gotta do. Yeah, like, you know just put up our ad It's only gonna pop up once every 24 hours. I'm like, all right, like I'll all bite I'll say this is then like it pops up three different ads every fucking visit I can only you're like hey, I thought I thought we had a deal right these like oh, I don't know what happened They're so shady, I'm never gonna I'm never gonna put ads like that on my side I'm like calling them back to complain. I remember phones ringing in an empty office like this Like shadow he would update me there was this one time because I turn ads off because I always turn ads off Yeah, but I go to it and yeah, I had three pop-ups and I'm like like shed Do you know that I just had three pop-ups and I've been here? I'm so sorry. I was like a phase. I was going through his testing thing The thing is like never gonna have that again The thing is and this is really funny because people are always confronting me on fucking like on Twitter and Tumblr And they're like hey, did you know that people are using your porn and stuff is like like animated gifts? I'm like what do you want me to do do fuck go put the fucking hammer down and be like please take down? Oh, they were using smash girl, right? Yeah, but it's like I can't do anything. They have no morals It doesn't matter. It's fucking smart. It does. There's no rules if they steal it and fucking turn it into a porn gift for their site What do you do? You're not making a mobster going to the cops being like, you know, they killed my friend It's like get out of here. I'm gonna fucking arrest you. I'll say people who sell porn ads on the internet They're morale is too maybe like a millimeter above like like people who sell children and

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:32.005 --> 0:52:32.444]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:50.449 --> 0:53:56.447]: 
  Actually, there's some people who generally want to show off their stuff. There's some safety like I think people like they're proud of their work And they want to show it off. There's also like a porn ad companies that are like um They're good like you you have like the jelly girls or whatever. Yeah, yeah The FLAA they have like a network, but it's like a network and the network They're not gonna be fucking you over because they're it's like you know, it's like an iPhone. It's like everyone works together They're not working together to fuck each other. I only have banner ads and I think banner ads are fine as long as they're not offensive I hate the most of the ones where you see it's like a really grainy gift of like an animated gift of some guy with a horse dick or something And he's sitting there like jacking it off like it's like an image that was like stretched and yeah Yeah, yeah, and I'm just like not only does this ad look fucking stupid and I'm not gonna click it But now I feel bad like you know, I'm now I feel kind of like I don't even want to watch porn anymore I feel really ashamed of myself. I just click out They're just like like is this fooling anybody flashing white and red

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:55.478 --> 0:52:56.440]: 
  I think there's people like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:04.607 --> 0:53:04.945]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:07.324 --> 0:53:10.092]: 
  Yeah, but it's like a network.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:19.289 --> 0:53:19.474]: 
  I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:28.570 --> 0:53:31.928]: 
  Like it's a fucking- It's like an image that was like stretched and see- Yeah, yeah, yeah, like-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:44.027 --> 0:53:44.955]: 
  There's always like this one.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:56.447 --> 0:54:00.582]: 
  I'm just gonna click this ad and bang! So like, I'm always like, okay, I got that.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:58.624 --> 0:55:12.216]: 
  So like I'm always like, okay, I gotta fucking scare the thing over. These sites do this thing where they push the ad into the video so you can't fucking minimize windows anymore. This is a Google thing. I've gone through all of that, but thankfully I'm not like above it, but like you have to like experiment with all kinds of shit. If you run a website. Do a legitimate website has the most fucked up ads and clickbait I've ever seen? I'm sure. Weather.com. Weather? They have the weirdest articles too! Weather.com? Weather. Yeah, like literally, it sounds like the most legit site ever, weather.com. And that is real weather, but it's filled with the most shady ads and clickbait shit you've ever seen in your life. That's almost genius, because you're getting like these old ladies and these old men who are like, I have this confetti picture. Nobody even wants to go there unless they're going to a blizzard company. Never even heard of me, but it is totally the equivalent of like the National Enquirer, old ladies standing in line to buy their fucking diapers and print juice. And they see, they see like Donald Trump fucking Kim Kardashian on the cover of National Enquirer, and they're going to buy that. That's exactly what this fucking weather.com should be. What I want to say though, they also have the best clickbait. They have clickbait on weather.com better than anything else on the internet. You have a little picture and it says, Will and Willan Astro to destroy our solar system?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:25.557 --> 0:54:27.666]: 
  weather.com?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:37.184 --> 0:54:37.639]: 
  That's...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:40.997 --> 0:54:45.317]: 
  like is I have this nobody even wants to go there never even heard to me

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54 --> 0:54:52.489]: 
  See you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:56.607 --> 0:54:56.961]: 
  That's it for this one.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:59.340 --> 0:55:00.674]: 
  What did it say no though?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:06.765 --> 0:55:06.867]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:11.676 --> 0:55:13.499]: 
  I mean

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:13.499 --> 0:56:08.055]: 
  And it's Weather.com! You can't get better than that. You can't get better than that. It's on Weather.com, of course you're gonna trust it. Are we gonna die in two years with Earth splitting in half? Will the sun explode and destroy Earth tomorrow? Like, I don't know, I'd like to read this. That's like people, I bet News.com has shady ads too, because people are typing in weather, news, shopping mall. You know what they do though? Shopping mall. Like the New York Times and like all these other guys, what they'll do is they'll have their ads, and then they'll have like suggested ads, or like sponsored news or something like that, below the actual news. But people can't tell that are like, because they all think it's all amalgamation of one post. Of course they do. It's like when you go to those download sites, like Media Blaze or whatever, Mega Upload or whatever. But you go like Puttlocker to watch like a free stream video. Well they'll have like next to the download buttons, they'll actually have ads that look like download buttons that say download this file, but it has nothing to do with the actual site that you're on. No, and you're usually grabbing yourself a malware. Yes, you are.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:14.882 --> 0:55:15.152]: 
  King!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:16.485 --> 0:55:18.865]: 
  It's better than that. It's like whether or not come up worse, you're gonna die.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:18.494 --> 0:55:24.636]: 
  Of course you're gonna trust me! We're gonna die in two years and we're gonna start splitting in half. We'll be done. We'll just unexplode and destroy Earth tomorrow.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:32.027 --> 0:55:34.238]: 
  You know what they do though? Shopping.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:42.895 --> 0:55:43.401]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:44.025 --> 0:55:44.447]: 
  But people

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:48.869 --> 0:55:50.303]: 
  Of course they do.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:54.809 --> 0:55:54.977]: 
  Like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:08.055 --> 0:56:10.587]: 
  Kind of asking for it when you go to the sites to buy it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:09.372 --> 0:59:07.639]: 
  Yeah, but it's like you risk it like if you really want to see dumb and dumber Dumb and dumber and you're going to putt locker. You better get ready for some shady Seby Shady like have your eyes and ears Sulta like there'll be the loudest shit like you like the new dumb and dumber check out the new dumb and dumber And you're like oh And then it's just like this loud fucking ad for like ointment cream or something It's never happened to you where an ad like you know how these they're called pop under ads Where they pop out but they pop out behind your browser. Yeah, I even noticed them Yeah, you look out of the screen Yeah, and then you're like wait and so does it when I was younger it happened and it was like things I do was like sounds playing Yeah, here's something that what was that? Yeah, I hear that it's like very faint. Yeah, you like something it doesn't and you think what the fun? It really makes you paranoid. Yes, you know, it's just this yeah Yeah, it doesn't happen anymore because it's like most browsers know how to manage that and keep it within Okay, but it used to happen Internet Explorer and I think it probably still does cuz Internet Explorer fucking sucks Yeah, but I think the absolute worst ads are when you go somewhere It's like you check and something out and some pops up. It's like from the FBI or something for the government. Oh, yeah We have detected illegal content You have to pay this X amount to here to unlock your browser Oh Do you want out are you sure you don't are you just can't exit into and out of this window? Sometimes it's just lock it and I don't know how to do it, but you just can't go out. Yes You just have to shut down your browser You have to like go to the task manager. Yeah eliminate the process. Yep. It's fucking ruthless It is dude like be illegal. Yeah in the Internet It was way easier back then because you were looking for screen savers and you were getting malware that way They have to be creative. Did you ever did you see the new South Park? There are the oldest new South. Yeah, the one with the ads. Yes Yeah, it was fucking genius because it's what everybody experiences But at the very end the part that made me laugh the most is when the PC principle was literally a PC fighting ads and At the end and I and like it's like two means like, you know PC like politically correct He's also an actual PC a personal and it was just like I look at that. I'm like My fucking head exploded. I'm like, oh my fucking god. I see I get it now this whole fucking season makes sense There's two meanings. It's genius But that was really funny because it's like ads bother everybody and they're really malicious over they put up I'll say the whole thing with you PC bro. You know that it kind of became a meme Yeah, it kind of makes sense because also like people who play computer games Yes, PC though is like like a fucking console. It's like you're not a PC. Fuck you You know like Games on a PC Being politically correct. It's fucking it is genius the new thing that's pissing me off is these Story related but these spam phone calls have been getting yeah, and they're getting more like threatening You get that all the time you're you'll be like working and then someone call you and you'll just be like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:18.164 --> 0:56:20.290]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:29.162 --> 1:02:43.335]: 
  I just love how like she clearly can't even read the script that she's got in front of her like You look up the phone number and it's like a million people have gotten this call from Annie Johnson What would it take in a phone call? Yeah for you to actually believe that it was a legal department of some financial Bureau trying to get money out of you. I mean obviously not an Indian lady who says her name I mean I feel like they would have to know information that's not readily available on the internet They'd have to know something about me, but they couldn't say it to you because you're on the phone Is that a rule? Yeah, because they can't just they can't repeat sensitive information because anyone could have picked up your phone My general rule is anytime somebody calls about anything like this. I immediately just hang up and block them So maybe there's even been real phone calls And if I have a problem with a bank I call them like right I feel like the general rule for me would be They'd have to send me something in the mail because I think that has to be that's traceable And if it's not traceable like a phone call or an email and there's people asking for sensitive information You just ignore it you ignore it until somebody knocks on your fucking door at which point you're like welcome in Whatever you need. I'm right here. Tom does something that I used to do whenever I actually had a phone He would he would get a number and he would google it to see if it's like an actual And then he if he saw that it's not or it's like people are talking about it as a scam He will block the number and I used to do that I would be on my phone someone call me and look it up and be like, oh, it's bullshit and then I block it Do they not realize that that also exists like the internet is always that everyone's finger tips Fishing thing right they're just gonna keep casting their line until some suckers. They're hoping you're a fucking it is one No, what's there hoping third world country? You know like if you're like some poor russian No, what they're hoping is you're they're hoping you're some poor defenseless 98 year old man or woman who hasn't had a social encounter With somebody in forever. Yes who got a call and they're just like, oh, don't you want to hear how my day was? They're just like, you know, it's thousands of dollars, man. Give us your fucking money, ma'am Yeah, that's 90 of them It was really sad. It's like also in the emails. It's everywhere Yeah, so much of it like as the guy who runs a website like I have like the spam filter in my comment section So there's actually legit people like not robots commenting But every now and then when the spam thing breaks down like this tons of messages of like Japanese sites trying to sell like watches handbags and stuff like who

  My handbags made by real Japanese people. Do you remember on MSN that like what happened? I don't know if you guys know like old instant messaging like software what used to get people is they'd be like did you see this photo of you? Oh yes! Did you know people are talking about you? Did you see this photo of you that they got online? Oh yes. Like those websites like classmates.com Did you know somebody is trying to contact you? Yes! And you have to pay money to see the message? Yeah! Another class that's like hey honey, you saw your profile pic. Yes! I like what I see. Yes! Here's mine and it's like eB332444E I'm not gonna fucking click that. That's the other thing. Dude always check those email addresses. It doesn't matter. I've seen PayPal emails that look that literally because it's easy to do. You just copy and paste the HTML of an HTML email looks identical but check out that email because if you see something where it's like paypal.x580538. whatever- hyphen-something.com you're just like wow. But we get like these fake Patreon things. We need more information. So many things in this world. I don't care about the bigger I don't care about who's gonna be president but things like when I go into Best Buy and they card me when I'm buying an R rated movie I just want to- I just like what are you doing? Yeah! And this woman this woman's like yeah I'm really sorry you know I had to card a hundred year old yesterday. It's like why? Like why? Yeah why? He's clearly fucking growing up. So you're really gonna get fired for not carding a hundred year old. He took- yeah. You blue-haired idiot.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:47.942 --> 1:02:48.651]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:01.409 --> 1:03:04.429]:

  Oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:13.853 --> 1:04:14.646]: 
  It's like, why?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:26.087 --> 1:06:05.852]: 
  It's like, you know, he took like, I saw him walking over here. It took him like 20 minutes and I had to call it a bad one. I was like, I was like, I was taking it back. I'm like, I started slowly pulling my idea on my wall. I'm like, do I really need to do this? When I went into Best Buy to just get information, I went up to the thing and they were like, can I see some ID? And it's like, I just want to know what they're. You know, those people are supers. Yeah. Look, there are corporate rules where they do kind of have to be serious, but there are circumstances where, yeah, they absolutely it is ridiculous. You could have a freaking Holocaust survivor. So I'm like 200 year old dude, walk up to the counter and the ladies like, hey, listen, sir, I'm really sorry. He's like, I forgot my ID. All I'm looking for is that new rated R fucking aliens movie. I heard it was decent. She wouldn't fucking give it to me. He could, he could show her the fucking tattoo, this fucking barcode number. And she'd still be like, no, that doesn't count. But all I was doing was looking for the fucking iPhones and iPads. And I went up to the information desk. He's like, yeah, we need to see your ID. And I was like, all right, well, here's my like fucking retarded ID. And I gave her an iPhone to use it to find it to talk to the information guy. He had an exclusive club that I had to show my ID to. You want to, I just want to buy a USB drive. They're like, can I have your zip code? Can I have your phone number? Can I have open email? Like fuck off. You go to, you go to, I go to like American Eagle Outfitter because that's like the only place I shopped for pants. And I go there, they're like, what's your zip code? And we need it for information. It's like, what, for, it's like, we're going to give you a card. I'm like, I don't want a card. They just assume that I wanted a card. You don't want to save money because you could save 20% right now. Yeah. And I'm like, I'll lose the card and don't care because that's, I've eaten that fucking Wendy's a hundred times and haven't used the Wendy's card that's sitting in my wallet collecting dust.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:31.420 --> 1:04:31.943]: 
  I was like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:31.943 --> 1:04:32.466]: 
  I was like,

 SPEAKER_00 [1:04:45.122 --> 1:04:47.451]: 
  They're really? You know those people are supers every look.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:13.185 --> 1:05:13.388]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:30.887 --> 1:05:32.406]: 
  that I had to show my ID to.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:56.183 --> 1:05:56.774]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:05.835 --> 1:06:08.637]: 
  You should though. You should use it. I used it once.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:07.422 --> 1:09:27.104]: 
  I used it once. Digital games so much because every time you want to buy a physical game You have to like go through all these things of like, you know like signing up for something I'm like you sure you don't want this because you'll get great benefits. Yeah, I just want the game That's another thing with gift cards not to be little the guy who gave me the Wendy's gift card I believe that was Hector, but yeah Hector's cool, but I used it But I don't know how much is on it now, and I don't want to go up to the people be like excuse me How much is on my Wendy's car? And they like fucking be like $5 and I'm like I can get a whole nothing or I can get some fries But it's like I don't do that. I just want to use it once and then it'd be all over them like here's the money from the card I'm like, oh wow, it's it's my birthday But there's these things now where you can actually turn your gift cards in for they give you the money off of it What yeah, but they take a percentage of it So if you have like a $30 gift certificate they take like 10% Actually does kind of make sense because it was purchased through that entity and if they're taking a cut They're just kind of like all right. Well, we get a little bit of free money. I guess yeah, basically Yeah, so if you have like a fucking gift certificate to like go to something like Lowe's and let's say you never shop there Yeah, you just give it to something like see this is why I like to turn in Amazon cards They're actually okay in my book only because you plug it in once and you have a digital wallet and you can see exactly How much you have yeah, but it's yeah It's like the gift cards for like a lot of other places where you're sitting there You got like five cards in your wallet and for all you know There's some kind of amazing statistic of how much money that goes unspent from you cards This guy is this like this like slob is sitting there with like 14 different gift cards Which he actually has like $600 on these like gonna sell my Xbox games I don't have any more money and really like this was something to do at GameStop where you can bring in your fucking gift Cards from anywhere in the world and they'll get they take a profit from it But they're still give you money off of it And while I think GameStop is still like the worst place to go to trade in stuff the fact that you still get anything off of it Yeah, is great because you again you're not gonna go into fucking Wendy's and spend two dollars You're gonna forget that how much money your card you're not gonna make a stink of it when you go in there Yeah, you know the same thing happens with rebates you get that you know they advertise it as a is a $50 phone But really like fucking $500 $50 rebate a week later that you have two days to mail in But I got like a $50 rebate now it's like Susie thinking is this even worse? Yeah, you also have to have like a photocopy of your receipt You have to have the barcode off the back of the box. Yeah a fucking blood sample urine sample They're like making you work for that extra I want to this I want to see something but it's something I want to stab somebody it does They my supermarket does this you go into the supermarket. I buy food every week or two everything's digital Everything's like top-of-the-line digital. You swipe your card. You're using digital keypads and screens and everything else I do like the self-checkout. Yeah, I love automated everything's top-of-line But then it's like a button up shows up Would you like a would you like five percent off your order it? But it won't give it won't give you five percent off the order you just bought it prints out a fucking paper receipt And it's like you can use this next time you just type in the 14-digit code on the back

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:21.985 --> 1:06:22.002]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:26.997 --> 1:06:28.937]: 
  But yeah, Hector's cool.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:58.772 --> 1:06:59.937]: 
  That actually does claim it.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:59.937 --> 1:07:00.612]: 
  It's going to make sense.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:07.058 --> 1:07:07.919]: 
  Basically, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:14.989 --> 1:07:16.356]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:28.960 --> 1:10:05.984]: 
  as long as 20 foot long paper receipt it's a fucking Sudoku puzzle that you have to fill out and once you have all the numbers you're a human next-order here and you'll get I'm like oh five that's crumbling up ladies with the coupons you know where they keep collecting these coupons and they have to like do all this searching and cutting out finding it in the right places yeah in the end all they save is like two dollars or something it's ridiculous you know this commercials you were talking about like rebate and stuff this is where it's like zero dollars for the first five days of Christmas yeah that's zero I'm talking zero dollars rebate zero dollars and then you're like I got this thing free

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:34.444 --> 1:09:35.524]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:37.482 --> 1:09:38.680]: 
  The next corner here.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:40.823 --> 1:09:42.020]: 
  I'll have a beer.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:52.095 --> 1:09:53.057]: 
  How ridiculous.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:59.858 --> 1:10:00.246]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:07.165 --> 1:10:09.105]: 
  Like four of them for free.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:08.498 --> 1:10:13.949]: 
  Yeah, oh no absolutely

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:10.523 --> 1:14:01.440]: 
  They slap you with that bill. So when you see something on line, it's like get you and your family free phones for $0 free payment for two weeks. You're like what's fucking steal, but it's really $25,000 I don't know how people live like that people fall for that shit. Yep. Well, absolutely Dude said they know I'm all they need is a couple of fucking suckers and bang They just made they just made so much money that you see those commercials They don't care if you if your whole family fucking has to move out of their house and you're all You know like yourselves the local gangs and shit. What's the closest? What's the closest guys ever scammed you think like what's the to being scammed? Yeah, I would say the biggest scam that I have experienced is gonna be The PlayStation now program. Oh, yeah, and program. What was that one? I'm so what though what'll happen is is like I looked up Resident Evil 4, right? And they got it You know, I was so excited. I wanted to spend I would spend $60 that I would just drop money on that game Even though, you know going back and playing it. It was okay, but still I know in the moment in the moment No, yeah, my past love of it. I just would have impulse buy it, right? So I see it it's on PlayStation now and it says you can play for free Actually, and I was like I can play it for free. Okay, so it says you got to sign up for it as soon as you click it It'll be like, okay. Look, it's not really free. All right. We're gonna do a free trial You're gonna week for free and it's your little auto renew and then and then not only that after that. It's 1999 and it's auto renew, but it's 1999 a month now in my head. I'm thinking hmm They've got you know Mega Man 10. They've got Resident Evil 4. There's kind of a selection You know, maybe I'll give it a couple months play some old games I haven't played stream them with friends, you know, you know, just you know relive a little bit of my past Well, here's the thing about PlayStation now Not only can you not stream these games because the service is a streamed game service meaning the games that you're playing Are coming from a different computer. So you're saying sending a signal across that then bounces back to you How fucking useful is that in any game that requires? I don't know accuracy or pushing fucking buttons How laggy was it it not only was Not only do you sometimes have to wait in line for a game to connect But once you connected I mean artifacts you see artifacts It's like those videos where they try to do these tracers that go across the entire Like when you use it's like a video freezes and then it plays. Yeah, yeah Like the degrading or the degradation of videos if you keep compress or processing or whatever Yeah, and then like sometimes you just straight up stop. They'll disconnect reconnect. I can't believe it's a thing It just doesn't seem like it would ever work see with with certain games make like an RPG You know, maybe I could get away with that a little bit But can you imagine playing like mega man? When they first added advertising that they were using Street Fighter 4 Dude any game that required any time a frame per second fighting game You would you would have to buy a new TV because you'd have two controllers and a console shoved through the screen Like there's no way you could fucking do it. It would be impossible. It's a great I think it's a decent idea if this was a beta service Maybe if we were testing it we were sending reports like internet speed upload download speeds all that shit You know I could live through the pain of trying to enjoy a game from my past and you know and being frustrated at times But there's no way like I don't know last month when I got an auto review notice in my fucking email saying oh by the way Yesterday we charged you Wait what? You're supposed to give me like a week or something what the fuck and then the best part is to turn it off Because I was traveling when I got auto renewed so I tried

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:13.442 --> 1:10:14.539]: 
  Oh, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:28.056 --> 1:10:29.355]: 
  Dude, is that an arms brand or pegar's?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:33.119 --> 1:10:33.692]:

  Oh, like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:39.293 --> 1:12:39.630]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:45.824 --> 1:12:46.330]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:59.982 --> 1:13:03.137]: 
  Take a man! You're trying to jump around the course set.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:08.014 --> 1:13:08.976]: 
  Oh my god!

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:13.769 --> 1:13:16.182]: 
  on a street fighter board

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:47.924 --> 1:13:48.278]: 
  I'm saying.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:59.500 --> 1:14:02.993]: 
  I got auto renewed so I tried I was like what the fuck no I gotta turn this

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:02.993 --> 1:14:24.002]: 
  the shit off.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:18.535 --> 1:14:19.463]: 
  Yeah, but then you block everything

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:23.564 --> 1:14:24.998]: 
  I'll go after you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:24.998 --> 1:22:10.664]: 
  But I signed up with Loot Crate. Before Loot Crate became what it is now. So keep in mind this is before Loot Crate was ever promoted by everyone. Right. Ever. This was Loot Crate original. Somebody told me about it and I'm like oh I get free like gamer crap stuff that you get at Spencers Gifts or other bullshit that you just get and it's just like oh here you just have some crap to decorate your room. Yes the shit that makes your room kind of you know fun and a little bit messy. Yeah. When you move out of that room you really just throw it all in the trash. Exactly. But the thing is when I signed up with it I was under the impression that I would get random shit like lame Minecraft toys and fucking like Batman stuff and all this. Stickers. Sonic stickers. Yeah like Fallout stickers just give me shit. I wanted stuff. Random stuff. Yeah. But the second I signed up they changed their fucking modeling plan to have themed random stuff. So I signed up to get random stuff. The first time I got it it was random and by the way they had the sign up thing where it's like oh you pay six dollars or something. It was just all this like really shady shit where it eventually goes to 1399 or like 2199 after a while. And so they kept mailing me shit. And by the way there's no way to cancel it on their website. You have to fucking call them in order to cancel it. I hope to God they changed their plan but for me I had to fucking contact them and say by the way I'm moving and I just thought I'd remind you that I wanted to cancel it. Because I'm not going to get this shit. So please don't send it. So not only was I terrified that people were going to still keep sending me fucking Luke garbage. Actually that's a great piece of advice that I never considered. If you're ever going to sign up for a service and I should take this advice you should try to Google how to cancel it first. Yes. Because if you can't find out how to cancel it there's probably a pretty good goddamn chance that they're trying to hide. You know like they're trying to make it as difficult as possible. Oh no no no I googled because afterwards I was like how do I cancel. I googled and I saw I saw Luke create incompetent and I'm like oh no okay. Too late. But the first thing was they sent me Luke create stuff was like teenage between a turtle shit. Okay I wasn't like a turtles fan but I don't mind turtles but I don't want these like lame ass five year old glasses and shitty fucking toys. I'm not gonna. I don't want. That's that. Yeah I don't. Yeah exactly. That was actually it. Yeah I don't want fucking Markiplier stickers and PewDiePie fists and shit and I was like excuse me I signed up for gamer stuff not YouTube garbage you they fucking couldn't sell. Yeah. But the thing is like they were first they did a theme where it was like teach me Ninja Turtles fucking Doctor Who which I didn't even know what the hell that was at the time. Yeah. Uh villains good guys I think Skylanders was one of them and I'm like I'm gonna kill myself. I don't want this garbage. And by the way it may come to a shock but when you put shirts in your fucking box people's size is an extra small. So these people are going to like fucking hot topic they're like what shirts can't you sell it's like oh the infant ones won't sell it's like give me those I mean what we need like because we know little babies. Wait when you sign up for the free they ask you your shirt size yeah okay so they do ask your shirt size and they don't get it right. And they just ignore it. This is bad. I get they do they ask you for all this stuff they're like you stuff and I'm like okay cool I'm gonna get all this crap. I never wanted anything they gave me. I think you're important. Yeah. I didn't get a single fucking thing I enjoyed. Something like a lawsuit. Yeah no I was like I when I told them on the phone I was like listen okay you want advice have two fucking options when you sell stuff and I know and I actually did say like I was like fucking I was pissed. I was like have one for random stuff and have the other for theme stuff. Because I guarantee there will be people who will want themes and random stuff. Yeah. You know I would just like thank you for your suggestion. How much is it? It was $13 but I think it's like probably 19 now. I would pay. I would pay if I really love some of this shit. If I if I came into a lot of money like obviously I wouldn't do it now but if I ever got into some money I would pay $40 a month if I could pick like 20 or 30 different things that I was really interested in and every loot crate only had things related to those 20 or 30 things. The tree. You know what I mean. Perfect. Blood, blood, born, blood, born things. Yeah don't hotline Miami. I'm not. That was if I got hotline Miami masks. Okay don't give me. For toys and shit like that. My little pony has bro shit. I don't want it. It can be right. But I mean somebody else though. Somebody else could be like I love Markiplier, PewDiePie, my little pony, Minecraft. Great. The boom. That's what you're gonna get. This is the thing. This is these companies like loot crate. They're just lying scumbags because they'll say oh yeah we're gonna have themed stuff this now from now on. And they'll still give you some excuse like you know this is what I think people want you know but it's a lie. No yeah. There's some hidden benefit. They either run out of the they ran out of all the cool stuff or the company is giving them these themed items are giving them some. extra monetary bonus for doing this. By the way, a loot crate has reached out to sleepy cabin. Oh really? Yeah Chris called me. Marvel. Yeah I know. When Avengers came out it was really strange that there was suddenly Marvel stuff in loot crate. Like I'll take their money and just hear the ad and don't buy their stuff there. Yeah I don't mind. I've never gotten a loot crate item and then you like went to the supermarket and saw like a toy in a cinnamon toast crunch box. And you were like wait a minute I got one of those. See that's the thing. And with loot crate it's like you know if you have loot crate and you enjoy the shit you get that's great. But the thing is I didn't sign up for themes. I signed up for random stuff. And fuck you loot crate for doing themes. When I didn't sign up I signed up for this stuff. So all these fucking one up cool kid box fucking gamer gear all this gay shit that people are selling that are the exact same thing. Probably do have random stuff and these motherfuckers that have all our friends promoting it just do themes. Hey I bet the theme that what came out uh Star Wars. Gee I wonder what the fucking theme is for the last thing. For what the month because it's monthly it's monthly you get it monthly. So you feel like it's more uh just product promotion rather than genuinely giving you something that you'd want. Yeah it's it's like fucking it's like you're basically saying hey the company to advertise to you. The lie though they will never tell you that. Yeah and but you know we think this is what you know based on focused testing this is what people want. Yeah people know this is making your bank account bigger asshole liar. People want these I think people really want this like a size one fit no one. Kylo Ren mask that can't even fit on a baby's face. You get this like tiny little mask and you just like I can't I couldn't even wrap this around my head without it ripping like shredding my ears when the fucking wire pops. I would love to see you get a loot crate like a box of loot crate clothes just put it on. Even if it rips. Even if it rips. I think I pretty much I think I have a shirt that's in a box it's it has like villains and it has like all the villains from Marvel. And it probably comes up to my tits. Yeah so I look like put on the mask. Yeah no I look like put on the hat. Yeah I'll put on the mask that stretches over and I'll put on my Teenage Mutant Turtles like Donatello plastic goggles. Slap that pink mustache out of here. And I'm coming up like hey guys just go back for Luca I'll do it I'll fucking do it. It will be fucking vile and gross and I don't think you'll see one person. Dude when you hyperventilate and pass out on con camera not only will you get a billion views but you have a lawsuit that you can fucking sue all this motherfucker. Let's hear Jeff's thing because I also actually have a scam story. This is a weird one. You tell me at what point you feel this is a weird shady situation even though I'm not I'm still not even sure. Is this worse than Indian Annie Johnson? I don't know well here's what happened I was here I'm knocking my door one day I was asleep I woke up I go to the door I'm drunk. I'm just like you know like when you're you're more susceptible I like to think I'm more susceptible to suggestion when I'm just waking up. Yeah yeah of course. And this little little Latina woman who's like four feet I don't know she's really short nice smiling she's like friendly and I'm like you know disarmed me. I'm usually I'm like ready I'm like you know.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:26.993 --> 1:19:28.259]: 
  I got one of those

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:02.295 --> 1:20:03.426]: 
  Yeah, that's you for what the m-

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:10.632 --> 1:20:10.902]: 
  Да.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:12.269 --> 1:20:14.783]: 
  It's like you're basically paying the company to

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:22.579 --> 1:20:23.170]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:03.518 --> 1:21:04.952]: 
  Probably comes up to my tits.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:06.792 --> 1:21:07.551]: 
  Yeah, no, I

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:17.609 --> 1:21:19.836]: 
  I was like, hey guys, let's go back.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:24.375 --> 1:21:26.097]: 
  Dude, when you hypoventilate in pep...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:33.859 --> 1:21:36.239]: 
  Oh yeah, Jeff, you said it skimpy too.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:22:12.419 --> 1:24:36.565]: 
  She sent a little nice little company shirt on little embroidered logo and she's like, hello sir, yes I am with this so and so energy. And I said, well, I'm already paying Pico for my energy. That's like Philadelphia energy company. They start telling you about rates and that you're being overcharged or that you think, yes, no, so yeah, so at first she's like, yes, you know, well, I said, well I already have, I'm already paying Pico. And she's like, well, we can save you a lot of money. And I said, oh really? Oh yes. She handed all these pamphlets and forms. And she's like, you know, just sign here and we'll save you money. Yeah. And I'm just like, my eyes are half shut. And I'm like, well, if you look official, I guess I could sign it. Cause I didn't give her any, I didn't give her any personal information. How could you not trust her? She's like, can I see her? Yeah, she's so friendly. And I wasn't giving her my credit card. I was just signing some forms. She's, I'm like, well, how does this work? She's like, oh yeah, we worked through your current electricity company. I'm like, all right, I guess I could try it. But then at some point I say to her, I'm definitely gonna save money doing this. And then she's like, whoa, you, you might save. You might actually pay more one month. You might pay less one month. Yeah. I said, oh really? So it was really just like total crap shoot. She's like, oh, it's more based on the market. You know, maybe you'll save some, maybe not. These people work on commissions. So they're running from door to door to door, trying to convince you as quickly as possible to sign up their shit. And then the last step is, she's like, oh, and the last thing, I need your phone. I need you to call my office with your phone. Yeah, she's really weird. And I hand over my phone up. And I'm like, I'm the back of my mind. I'm like, this is just so strange and I don't wanna do this, but I'm just fascinated. I'm just wondering where this is gonna go. I give her my phone and she calls up. She's like, hello, this is Maria. And she quickly hands the phone back to me. She's like, okay, just wait here on the line. Eventually somebody will answer and just say you agreed to these things. Yeah, agreed to all the terms in it. And she runs off. And I'm standing in my doorway in the rain, holding this phone, waiting for some stranger to come back. And she's gone. Okay, do you want me to tell you when it sounds shady? Where? When she asked you to hand me your phone. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'm standing there and I'm like, while I'm waiting for this guy, I'm like waking up and like, you know, maybe I don't wanna do this. So this guy come to me and I'm like, oh, hello, sir. Do you agree to all the terms and conditions? I'm like,

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:24.704 --> 1:22:26.627]: 
  That's like Philadelphia Energy Company

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:29.243 --> 1:22:30.222]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:53.340 --> 1:22:55.214]: 
  I need you to be so assured.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:57.374 --> 1:22:57.762]: 
  You know?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:20.779 --> 1:23:20.931]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:44.084 --> 1:23:45.653]: 
  Yeah, which is really weird.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:24:08.130 --> 1:24:09.362]: 
  You agree to these things.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:24:22.491 --> 1:24:23.436]: 
  Oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:23.436 --> 1:24:24.449]: 
  So I'm standing there.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:24.449 --> 1:24:25.242]: 
  Like, I- I-

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:37.459 --> 1:26:10.474]: 
  And I reiterated with him, I'm like, can you just reiterate? So I'm definitely, there's no guarantee I'm going to save money. And he was like, no, no, there's no guarantee of that whatsoever. Yeah, because he's being recorded. So he has to do that. He's just blunt. And I'm like, well, you know what? I think I'm just going to pass on this. And he's like, all right. I'm not sure what it was. No, what is it? It was, look, basically, they were going to record his voice saying, yes, I agree to this. So they can basically be like, oh, he agreed to this. They could use it in like, laudering. Like they could go buy, get a bunch of money. And I don't know if that's exactly the case, but I don't know if that's not true. Because I had just really quick, the exact same thing happened, but with newspapers. But it's interesting to me that the same method where the guy didn't have a phone, he just straight up didn't even have one. Yeah. And he was like, we need to call to confirm this. And then, you know, it's all seem legit. He put it on speakerphone. We all sat around the table. We all had the pamphlets. And it was like, oh, hey, yeah, this is so and so I'm calling in, you know, order, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I have them here. They understand the terms. Can we get a confirmation? We also do that. We actually did confirm though. So that was a sign thing, not a phone thing, but the phone that handing over the phone and them saying like, yeah, oh yeah, I'm representing so and so. Just say you agree. Sounds like a tactic. If she would have ran off so fast, maybe I would have agreed. I would just, I would just stand there alone with my own terrible thoughts. And I said, this isn't right. I'm going back to sleep. This spell was broken. Yeah. She, she, I was on her. Latino gypsy. I was enchanted by this 45 year old four foot Latino woman.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:24:51.111 --> 1:24:51.921]: 
  He has to do that.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:51.921 --> 1:24:52.461]: 
  He's just...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:56.579 --> 1:24:56.697]: 
  All right.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:25:10.804 --> 1:25:11.429]: 
  I don't know if that's...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:42.394 --> 1:25:42.934]: 
  So that was a-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:01.935 --> 1:26:03.404]: 
  This smell was broken.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:05.631 --> 1:26:06.998]: 
  Her Latino gypsy...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:26:06.593 --> 1:26:08.500]: 
  gypsy spell.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:26:10.474 --> 1:26:10.525]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [1:26:11.740 --> 1:26:25.324]: 
  little little witch It was all a lie little little energy witch Yeah, she was behind the building like this you couldn't see her but she was waiting just like Yeah waiting for you to press the button There was a puff of purple smoke and you're just sitting there like you're just like

 SPEAKER_00 [1:26:14.490 --> 1:26:15.959]: 
  A little energy

 SPEAKER_00 [1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:29.155]: 
  But then you're just sitting there like you're just like An old hag Like AHHHHH What you know you guys

 SPEAKER_03 [1:26:28.379 --> 1:28:40.797]: 
  You guys all have like stories like little fees monthly fees You had to pay and then you could like get out of it or in your case you almost got scammed right But I actually have been legitimately robbed scammed. Just when I got out of the army That's the phase where you you don't have nothing you have nothing you have to like I was like I went to like a Boxing factory to get money. It was like this really shitty job And I was like this is a time in my life where I should get a driving license Otherwise will be a nobody and my dad was always like you got to get a driving license I was like, okay, I'm gonna do it now. It's my time. I've nothing I'm just working a shitty job and I'm tired running at home. I got to get a driving license So in Switzerland if you want to get a driving license, okay? Sorry You know before we were talking about how there's like a nail that keeps getting pounded into your head Yeah, you don't have to correct yourself, but we call it a driver bothering me to I would have said I would have said I got my driver license It was just like after the fifth time I kind of felt like I did at least mention it just throw the asterix up I'll say guys And because this in Switzerland I will use the term dollars, but we obviously we use Swiss francs Which is almost on par if not a little more valuable than what the US dollar. Yes, but I'll just say dollars sure Make sure you don't understand but in Switzerland if you want to get a driving license a driver license You must by law take lessons from a professional teacher Okay, and then has a minimum amount of lessons which is was around 10 Yes, and then you can do the test that they have that here too. Oh, they have that here, too Okay, so I called this guy up who's a teacher. He says okay I can teach you how to drive and it's not the automatic kind as I was telling you Yeah, what you call that manual manual and he said it was like $150 per lesson. Geez. Yeah, that guy and I was like, oh man These lessons one hour it was ridiculous and that's so much I guess like an entire now Is this government run it like is it part of no, he's he's a free he's a freelance guy But he was like the only guy in my area because I lived in a shady town And he talked like he was like this older guy was like a math teacher looked like a math teacher and he talked really slowly Yeah, hello, mister.

Everything me and I was working in is shitting boxing. You did a fucking blue collar job. I spent my army money on it. You had the guy from fucking Ferris Bueller's day off. Tell you you're fucking instructing direction. I thought it was important. What did your family say when this happened?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:29:39.488 --> 1:29:39.944]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_02 [1:29:39.944 --> 1:29:40.720]: 
  I was like, okay.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:29:47.301 --> 1:29:53.022]: 
  No, no, I know

 SPEAKER_00 [1:29:53.832 --> 1:29:56.076]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:30:00.210 --> 1:30:02.404]: 
  You had the God.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:30:07.855 --> 1:30:12.968]: 
  What did your family say when this happened? They say get it driving, so oh my god.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:30:11.061 --> 1:30:49.030]: 
  Oh my god. And like, you know, like the neighbors, they walk up to see you driving around the car. And then when you're done, they're walking up. It's like, oh, you're finally going to get your driver license. Like, it's like this really important thing. And I'm like, yeah, I'm becoming a man. So like everybody's like supporting you kind of justifying all of this. Okay. Okay. I can't like make myself look like a fool. I do the second test day comes around. Do the same thing. It's entirely different guy this time. Okay. I do the test and he says, no, if you're not ready yet. Again, and I was like sitting in the car and I had one. I remember I had one more lessons out of the next 10. I was supposed to do that one more lessons. I want to sitting in the car and he was like.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:30:20.629 --> 1:30:20.950]: 
  Okay, like it's a

 SPEAKER_00 [1:30:27.430 --> 1:30:29.640]: 
  Yeah, that's like, you got a guy.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:30:46.988 --> 1:30:47.747]: 
  Alright, one more lesson.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:30:49.030 --> 1:30:54.430]: 
  Yeah, this happens sometimes like just keep doing it. I think the third time he's gonna work again

 SPEAKER_03 [1:30:54.008 --> 1:35:59.007]: 
  work, a third time, such arm. And I was like, I don't want to do it anymore. Yeah. And he said like, I never came across a case like this. This is so absurd. Why would you stop now? I've never seen anything like this. I was just like, I don't want to do it anymore. Do you know why? Because people would have already invested. I call it the subway theory. Where like when you're waiting for a subway train, like you've waited so long that eventually you can't leave. Because if you've waited for a, like let's say you're in New York, right? It's late at night. You have the option to take a cab or to take a bus or a walk. But when you've waited 45 minutes for a train, there's a part of you that's like, well, if I leave now, it could show up in just five minutes. Now, and every minute you stick around longer is another minute you've invested. But it's also another minute it could be coming. That's it. The longer you stay, the more trapped you become. And eventually you just have to say, you know what? Fuck it, this train could come right, right as I'm going up the stairs, which does happen sometimes. Like, fuck it, I'm just getting the cab. I don't even care when it comes. And that's what you did. But most people, they just become, they get more and more invested. And they can't leave. You know what? I also think that that whole driver license thing, that's completely bullshit. You don't need a driver license. I don't have a driver license. And it's just fine. There's Uber and stuff. You don't need one. It is convenient to have the option. There are times where it would be, you know, like, if you need to rent a vehicle and get somewhere, I do think it's beneficial. But this idea of taking the tech, first of all, $150 a day is so fucking incredibly ridiculous. It's one hour of a less than $100 a day. No, no, that's so ridiculous. Second of all, at least here in America, there's two tests, right? There's like the written and whatever, and the point and click test. And then there's the driving test. You can take that driving test as many times as you want. I think you pay a little bit, maybe, like $20. I don't know what it is. It's not very much. But you certainly don't have to go through all the lessons again. So you can, and some people, it does take a couple of tries, but there is no way they force you to go through another fucking $1,500, 15 hours. Do you do what's for like, where I come from, where it is to get your license? It's $35 to take the test and $14 for your license. Do you have to take lessons? No, you just take the test. Could you like just teach with your dad? In high school, I took driving lessons. Yeah, yeah, I was trying to help you. Yeah, it was like your dad just teach you how to drive? Oh, oh, there's like a rule? Yeah, you're right. There's a rule where you have to have recorded at least a year with an adult figure in the car. Yeah, yeah, yeah, someone has to be recorded. For some reason, in Switzerland, it needs to be a professional, because they don't trust anybody else. That's fucking stupid. You could just have someone who can drive. They're a professional. They gotta fucking be here. But does somebody even have to be a guy who teaches you the correct way? Dude, that's absolute ripoff nonsense garbage. That sounds like you're right, dude. And it kind of makes sense why they make it such a big deal in Switzerland, because like, oh, you're finally doing it. You're doing that big step, because it's like this really expensive thing. And in the end, I was more than $3,000 shorter, and I walked away with nothing but bad experiences. I hope that guy specifically has a head-on collision with an unlicensed driver. That's what I thought. It's just his job. His job, I know. I think of anything that the teachers who were at the test, they were kind of dicks for just being like, again, not good enough. They go, well, what were they measuring? Because I did it. I knew how to drive. They should have a clipboard, and they mark off every single thing. And then they hand it to you, and they say, these are the three things or the four things that you missed. You know, like, you couldn't parallel park, or you hit a cone when you did this turn. And that way, you know exactly what you missed, so you know what to fix. There is no cones. Do you know what's? We don't drive with cones. Do you know what's? We drive on the actual road. OK, well, then they tell you that you missed this turn, or you drove too fast, so you know exactly what happened. Do you know what's fucked up when I was learning how to drive? For my license expired and never came again. Donuts in your driveway? I don't know if I can say this, because it was bad, and I shouldn't have done it. But it's, you know. I live everything in your life. It's like too late now, and it's like, what are you going to do? They're going to catch you now. I used to drive. I didn't have a license, but I used to drive at a park at night when there was no anyone. It was like one in the morning, and I used to drive around the park. And I would learn how to turn that way, and learn how to stop, and like make landmark sounds. That's a very, that's one of those things, like your dad or your uncle or whatever. Come on, let's go drive. Yeah, but my dad, I didn't have my license though, but my dad would be right next to me, and he'd be like, before you get your license, you know, yeah, you can take your fucking test, but who cares? What you need to do is have actual driving experience before you actually go write your test. Yeah, I was saying to Chris, if you were going to write your test. But I don't know if that's bad. Like, I didn't have a license. He was next to me. No, that's not bad, dude. What would be bad if he was like, hey, let's go to the park at night. I'll teach you how to drive here. You're not allowed to drive, so you can put your hands on the steering wheel. You got to sit on my lap though, and I'm going to push all the pedals. I drove. And that would be bad. I liked driving, but then I got. There'd be no less station. I have this weird thing, and I know, I have this weird thing when it comes to driving, and it's my own personal, like, phobias. But I freeze up when things don't go the way when I'm driving. I'm alert. Everything's happening. But the second someone isn't driving properly, or they're coming too fast, or they're fucking up, or they're cutting in front of me, I freeze up. So I'm not going to drive.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:30:57.720 --> 1:30:58.665]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:31:03.627 --> 1:31:04.352]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:35:57.522 --> 1:35:58.163]: 
  freeze up.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:35:59.007 --> 1:36:00.542]: 
  I'm not ever gonna drive in a car with you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:36:00.390 --> 1:41:04.950]: 
  Well, it's something I have to get over. I need to go to a parking lot a big abandoned amusement park Oh, cuz he was yeah, he was gonna do that license. I guess that's what I'm saying like it like I need it I need a park where it's just completely abandoned with like two cars. There's an amazingly big parking lot It's absurd though. I I felt my I felt my written test twice Me too that was challenging, but the actual driving test is absurdly Simple it is yeah It is weird guy this guy who doesn't give a shit gets in the car with me sick Okay, driving this track around a circle and then parallel park another thing like when it comes to that when you're talking about like It's so much easier to drive than take the test because in the fucking test They have situations where you only run into them on occasion like oh, there's a giant fucking semi in your way Here's his blind spot. Here's his blind spot. Here's all the other areas you can see here's what he can see What area should you be in at what sort of time and it's like I don't know when I'm fucking in that situation you have any semi-sem situations we have a semi at that exact time It's just embarrassing to hear stories like Shad story We're like, you know clearly he got scammed in like this system that and then here I was on fucking 76 east Just today driving from time to town back to the house There was at least five people that were not only not signaling But they were speeding and weaving through traffic And somebody felt at some point that it was totally okay to hand these people a license each one of those guys is a fucking Rec waiting to have every day. I just see people. I don't understand how they ever There's people who come through a complete stop on an on-ramp or don't know that would know no no a turn signal is They don't use turn signal Accessory like there's something like oh, yeah, they drive through the curve rain goes keep going straight and you're like that doesn't make sense To be fair all this stuff you're talking about is in Switzerland like not the case Everybody can properly drive like and get their roads feel really maybe maybe that You're meaning that that maybe that just really that $4,500 License yeah, they meant a lot to them. Yeah, maybe that they're just really hot because I was gonna say it's almost the opposite here Cuz I've heard a lot of cases where where people said that in the test like after they took the test that the Tester that they had looks over and is like I don't know I could go either way on this like Like a you know you did miss a car I probably shouldn't do this But yeah, you can get a license and they just like signed the thing like Some of people start crying and stuff and they're like, okay You come in and there's like this girl her like tits are hanging out. Yeah, barely legal And she's like oh god, I gotta get ready to go to the prom You know, I gotta I gotta have the nice like Corvette and he's like well, you know promise me you'll be careful He's like can you get out of the car and do a spin for me? Here's your license. I'll say this Let's say you're 15 or 16 years old be prepared to lose a few friends. Yeah, I'm gonna lose a few in the next few years They're gonna crash the people are gonna it's inevitable Oh, I thought you were those friends because it's not your license. They're gonna all your friends are gonna fucking They're just gonna ride it They were to freeload in your car not pay for gas They were gonna eat in the back of your car leave all the trash everywhere you go to a party They're gonna puke in the back seat and it's not even gonna be your car You're driving your parents car Then you had to explain why your friends were either a in the you know in your car to begin with because you weren't even supposed To take the car out but be why it smells like fucking puke and booze in the back of the car because you weren't supposed to be going Oh, it's more like it's more like they're gonna decide to pass a car on a blind turn and you'll never see them again That's that's what I do. No, so do you always saying you know a lot of people? Yeah, I didn't car crashes I know I know at least half dozen people who died But like more on bikes than cars because one one guy a lot of them of half of them were during winter. Yeah I've gotten in so many near like death Co-accidents with my friends. Yeah, just be eating food and suddenly the car spins out of control There's cars everywhere, and I'm just like I'm gonna die with a fucking burger in my head I'm just some reason that the series of events you just described you're driving you start eating food Your car suddenly begins to spin out of control and as soon as your car is done spinning There's just cars everywhere. There's just here like the imagery of like the series of if there's roads coming in your car Like this way and you just like yeah somehow I never you know never happened Yeah, but there's been times where and this is another thing like I don't know if it's anecdotal evidence or if it's like my own like Observation, but have you seen how old people fucking park? Have you seen like some old people like are on curbs and shit? And it's just like oh man Lexi were at Target and this like old motherfucker was near the door with his car Where the fucking automatic door opens? He was like a fucking five feet away, and it's like that can't be where you do What are you gonna do yellow? He's an old man. He should be a person It's there should be like a rule where it's like okay There should be a certain age where you have to repeal your fucking That's true. It's true, but people of races got their own race cars. They keep close to their pocket old people they know

 SPEAKER_00 [1:48:19.515 --> 1:48:20.680]: 
  I was afraid he would pull out.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:48:24.325 --> 1:48:25.253]: 
  What do you mean? Blow your head off.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:48:27.514 --> 1:48:28.493]: 
  This is the 12 gauge.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:48:28.493 --> 1:48:29.354]: 
  I got it

 SPEAKER_02 [1:48:42.938 --> 1:48:44.457]: 
  I wanna, yeah, I wanna, oh, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:48:45.773 --> 1:48:53.451]: 
  was it? I just want to say what you said was you know all these young people they think that they're smart with their smartphones but they're not.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:48:53.451 --> 1:51:34.995]: 
  smart because they can't look up and see what the sky is. It was like sage advice from some psycho who was trying to show me his YouTube channel about 70 songs. I never- It's a cute line though. It is cute. It's cute. And it's true. Clearly just because you have a smartphone doesn't make you smart and clearly young people have fused vertebrae in their necks and they are unable to look up. Pay a part of that generation. He was drunk. That's why he was playing air guitar in a Plink Floyd in a fucking place because no one else in the right mind would do that. I'm part of the smartphone generation but I fully agree that yeah we look at our phones way too much. We do yeah. It's true. Someone made like a famous painting about some like weird distorted face with a nose looking down and it's just like our generation. It was like making a blight on our generation and he was talking about that and I'm like okay I'm sorry you know we live- yeah I enjoy the fact that I can have internet whenever I want and that I like wifi and yes I am connected to the internet all the time. But at the same time it's true that- Is there a problem with it? Yeah. Maybe I want to live my life connected to the internet. But at the same time it's true that we don't need to know what our Twitter status is 24 seven. No it's true true but then he was like scolding me for not knowing how to skin a fucking animal. Okay that's- Yeah before that he's like if someone puts you in the wild and give you a knife and you were to live there for a month I bet you wouldn't be able to fucking kill a single thing you know what I'm saying. And you'd be like I knew how to skin an animal I knew how to make a house and I'm like it's just like imagine someone with an iPhone and the guy's telling you about survival stories. You know my dad's friend say shit like that. Yeah. And he's like 50 something and he's talking about survival. It's like you know what motherfucker pretty sure I could attempt to survive if my life depended on it. Okay you know what you know just because I don't have a skin a fucking animal I could figure other stuff out. Yeah. So just because you're fucking bearded real in the making. You know what I love it when they try to drop that on you like because my ex father-in-law he had some friends that you know is oh you don't know how to chop down a tree correctly or you don't know how to do these things. And granted these are these are good skills. Yes. But if you're gonna get in my face old man listen I got all the respect for you. But don't don't try to drop don't try to guilt trip me because I don't know how to like defether a fucking bird or skin animal because the next time you try to ask me how to forward an email I'm telling you. You know what I mean. You know who I was. There's clearly different skill sense and abilities that we all have. He's actually treating you like you're some little hairless kid. You're 25 you're a man of the beard. Yeah I'm just sitting there and I'm being polite and being like mm-hmm. You know it's like the Pink Floyd like they were progressive at the time. If you could appreciate Pink Floyd you should also appreciate what's progressive right now. Right exactly and this is just one of those things where it's like they're like I don't care about what now but you need to care about what I like and it's like fucking dude. It's like take your own advice fucking and you know what I didn't even subscribe to your fucking YouTube channel.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:48:56.657 --> 1:48:58.581]: 
  Yeah. It was good, it was good.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:49:03.205 --> 1:49:05.787]: 
  It's a cute line up

 SPEAKER_02 [1:49:05.787 --> 1:49:06.479]: 
  It's cute.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:49:15.372 --> 1:49:17.228]: 
  Pay up part of that generation.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:49:18.359 --> 1:49:18.629]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:49:29.395 --> 1:49:30.222]: 
  We do, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:49:48.514 --> 1:49:50.539]: 
  But at the same time, it's true that- Is there a problem with it?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:49:52.885 --> 1:49:52.902]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:49:54.927 --> 1:49:57.779]: 
  Oh yeah. The Twitter status is 24 seven. No it's true.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:49:56.817 --> 1:49:57.745]: 
  No, it's true.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:50:18.383 --> 1:50:20.796]: 
  My dad's friends say shit like that.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:50:33.587 --> 1:50:33.807]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:50:34.735 --> 1:50]:

  You know what it is? You know what it is?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:51:10.611 --> 1:51:11.404]: 
  It's very condescending.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:51:11.050 --> 1:51:12.147]: 
  You're 25 years old.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:51:13.075 --> 1:51:14.020]: 
  Yeah, I'm just sick of it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:51:22.626 --> 1:51:23.234]:
