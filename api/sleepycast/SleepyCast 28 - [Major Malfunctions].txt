 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:24.409 --> 0:00:51.983]: 
  Going to a mixing restaurant, we get a large portion. I got four tacos. OK. When you bring food home from the restaurant in your little take-home box, you know, the assumption is you're going to eat them. Oh, man, they were delicious. Each taco came with its own little lime slice. I put them in the new grounds refrigerator. I'm like, they'll be safe here. I open the refrigerator door. And they're not there.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:45.098 --> 0:00:45.570]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:58.429 --> 0:01:21.599]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense. A world enveloped by a seemingly unending ocean of forests. Buried deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little cabin. And in that cabin... Is a bunch of guys, is a bunch of bullshitter...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:21.599 --> 0:01:45.831]: 
  Cory, would you like to offer your side of the taco? The taco? Yes, I will put it close to the taco discussion. Close this out. Because people want to know the truth. They want to know the truth. They only hear it through Jeff's eyes. And in a real investigation, you don't hear it through the victim's eyes. Oh wait, let's do it like this. You be Cory's lawyer and I'll be Jeff's lawyer.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:24.822 --> 0:01:26.678]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:15.572 --> 0:03:47.954]: 
  Hello Corey, do you think Jeff will eat these tacos? I don't know. See? As a friend, you should have been like, yes! Ah, but here's the thing Jeff. Here's the thing Jeff, there have been times, and I've noticed it might just be a cognitive bias based on where we go, but that you leave Jasmine's stuff in the fridge. You know what I leave in the fridge? You know what I leave in the fridge? Order in the court! If Jeff left his wallet on the table, would you take money out? Because every now and again, he leaves money on the table? But no, overworld objection!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:25.512 --> 0:03:26.507]: 
  Ah, but here's a thing.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:26.507 --> 0:03:27.199]: 
  here.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:45.711 --> 0:03:59.903]: 
  But no, overworld objection. To be fair. He doesn't leave money on the table for people to eat. If it's in the fridge, it could be up for grabs. Did you have- You can't eat money! Did you have a sticker like your name on it? Spend it on food though! They knew it was mine. Did you have a sticker saying, Jeffs, do not eat?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:52.394 --> 0:03:52.495]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:52.495 --> 0:03:54.503]: 
  You can't eat money! Can't you have a stick?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:54.503 --> 0:03:56.005]: 
  brother, it's urgent

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:56.005 --> 0:03:57.574]: 
  They knew it was mine.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:59.903 --> 0:05:10.390]: 
  Okay, here's what happens. Is that a nice thing? That's a universal sign. Am I working with children? Do I need to do that? Alright, hold on, hold on. What? Apparently. Before we start pointing fingers, here's what really happened. It's been pointed. Shad came to me. He came to me with a sad puppy dog eyes. You know what, I'm gonna let him finish his statement if he wants to. I have my objection in mind. The fact that you might not have cars or anything is your problem. Honour! Honour! Honour the court! Roman Jalen, throw out the key. Okay, look at it. Sorry, your honour. No, anyways. You tell us what happened. Shad, tell the court what happened, Quorum. Shad came to me with puppy dog eyes, carrying a bag of tacos, his bottom lip quivering, and he's like, he's very hungry, and I'm like, you know what, it's fine. He just doesn't always eat his leftovers. There's a wall about five minutes of the street walking this way. That's cool. Actually, it was closed. It was closed. Okay. That doesn't make it okay though. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Anyways, the real victim, the real person, the real perpetrator, the real enemy who started this to begin with was a little alcoholic beverage I like to call 99% proof peach alcohol and a little bit of blue moon. Passing the buck to an inanimate object. Hold on, hold on.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:01.202 --> 0:04:01.945]: 
  That's a universal

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:06.315 --> 0:04:06.720]: 
  Well.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:08.982 --> 0:04:10.230]: 
  It's been pointed.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:13.487 --> 0:04:13.504]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:13.504 --> 0:04:13.791]: 
  You're on!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:16.964 --> 0:04:18.060]: 
  This is my dream.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:19.950 --> 0:04:22.499]: 
  My elders don't have cars or anything.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:22.499 --> 0:04:22.954]: 
  You're a pro.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:27.983 --> 0:04:28.827]: 
  Sorry, your honor.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:29.991 --> 0:04:32.354]: 
  Anyways, you tell us what happened.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:46.022 --> 0:04:48.874]: 
  That's cool. Actually, it was closed

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:11.200 --> 0:05:42.655]: 
  My alcoholic side, Corey's alcoholic side is the fucking... I can't help you here dude. This is a, you're digging your own grave. You accept it, but I hate one of the tacos. I ate one of the half eaten tacos, yes. So you're guilty of eating his tacos. Oh that's right, there were two of them. You are a list of Shad, you're guilty. I am. Look, if Shad started killing somebody and then you came in to start stabbing him, then you're still guilty of murder because you helped commit the crime. You're guilty and sentenced to death. That is true, you're still being...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:15.165 --> 0:05:21.443]: 
  I can help you here. This is that you're digging your own grave. You accept to be dying.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:21.443 --> 0:05:21.612]: 
  one of the

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:27.147 --> 0:05:28.919]: 
  There were two of us. You are the Sub-Shad.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:41.507 --> 0:05:45.524]: 
  That is true, you're still be guilty of accessories to Taco Leading.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:43.330 --> 0:06:52.450]: 
  Who's idea was this devious scheme? Who said Shad's puppy dog eyes are my drunk side May man off before before we close up the case may offer one other Extenduating piece of evidence you're a rule let the court show I'm opening case. I'm you know what what what you know, uh, Josh who works here had a sandwich in the fridge What happened to that Corey? All right? Let me explain myself I gave the two-day rule on the sandwich in the fridge the two-day rule stands if somebody has eaten and after two days I assume fair play because it's been in there for two days and most people Let's say something like McDonald's or Burger King are not gonna reheat something that's been in there for a few days You will though we got a day However however to clean out the however I also thought it was Tom who left it there for that one time when we went out and Tom said you know I might just go to Burger King or something so you thought it was okay to eat your balls No, hold on. I thought he went to Burger King and left food in there There was no way Tom would reheat fucking two-day old like Burger King to look you are making a lot of assumptions So I assumed yeah, no I did a lot of leaps of lawyers turning on you ladies and gentlemen

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:48.494 --> 0:05:49.624]: 
  guys on my drunk side.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:05:57.994 --> 0:05:59.496]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:38.494 --> 0:06:39.254]: 
 好慢好慢

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:45.025 --> 0:06:45.835]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:00.938 --> 0:07]: 
  He was like my favorite video. And he's saving it. See, the fact that he only paid $300 for a little bit of money.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07 --> 0:07:36.780]: 
  The lawyer shows you got a shitty lawyer. Actually, $300 is a steal for a lawyer. Not me! What kind of fucking lawyer whose job is to protect you says, wow, you fucking paid. I'm a worthless lawyer. You wasted three dollars on me. Look, I'm not even a lawyer. Better car. I'm at the University of Phoenix. Guilty. Guilty. Next topic. No, no. Hold on, hold on. Guilty sentence to death. This is what happened. Before Shad ate it, and then he was like, these tacos are awful. And I'm like, you should probably heat them up. But then I went, and I got drunk. And then I came back, and I'm like, fuck it. How many of the rest of them? You know what?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:10.017 --> 0:07:11.502]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:38.940 --> 0:07:39.818]:

  Jeff, you got this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:03.764 --> 0:08:14.445]: 
  And if I could also say to the jury of sympathetic listeners right now, Jeff has never stolen Corey's food. I rest my case, your honor. No, it's true. Wait, Corey, do you have any final words, Corey?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:11.121 --> 0:08:18.310]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:17.854 --> 0:08:45.816]:

I always felt like Johnny was a more fitting name for you, but I started calling you, Jeff. Was Johnny? And that was the end of it. I was almost Henry. Sorry, was Johnny played by Keanu Reeves? Wait, who was I? I was almost Kenneth. Weird. I don't know what's going on. Well, you're almost... No, you know, when you talk to your parents, they're like... Yeah. Oh, I almost called you that.

  No human being is completely symmetrical. As you notice, I have new glasses and I look like a fucking idiot right now. I like your glasses. I'm gonna go, if you guys want to read some books later. You do look like an intellectual. You look like an engineer. Like that's another example. Or a literaturist. These don't have like the rubber pads, they're all like one piece. And I got two pairs of the same thing and they're the exact same glasses. One was sitting crooked on my face and the other one wasn't. I didn't understand it and he just had to remind me that everyone is fucking asymmetrical. Like one ear sits lower than the other ear. One of my eyes sits lower than the other. How much does a body guys ever see like a mirror image of yourself? Yeah, everything just...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:33.239 --> 0:14:33.947]: 
  I like your glow.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:33.947 --> 0:14:34.184]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:37.019 --> 0:14:37.694]: 
  No, you look...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:39.415 --> 0:14:39.499]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:39.499 --> 0:14:40.562]: 
  We're not an engineer.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:41.862 --> 0:14:42.621]: 
  or at least

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:02.432 --> 0:15:02.939]: 
  You're learning a thing.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:02.939 --> 0:15:03.732]: 
  I said one of my

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:05.200 --> 0:15:05.588]: 
  How much?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:08.777 --> 0:15:15.089]: 
  Yeah, everything just always you take a photo yourself. Yeah, all of a sudden my nose is crooked. I don't like the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:11.376 --> 0:15:32.740]: 
  Yeah, all of a sudden, all these problems. Yeah, my nose is crooked and shit. I don't like the idea that when I look into the mirror, I see, like, you know, my nose is getting so set dark and sad. No, no, no, just the idea of sad men sitting in the... No, just the idea that when you look into a mirror, everything is expanded. So it's like, it makes your face, it makes you look bigger, fatter in the face than you normally do. Oh, no, no, it doesn't.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:14.447 --> 0:15:14.937]: 
  I don't like this.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:20.067 --> 0:15:23.627]: 
  This is getting so set dark and sad.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:28.099 --> 0:15:28.622]: 
  So it's...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:30.985 --> 0:15:31.035]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:31.035 --> 0:15:46.527]: 
  No, it doesn't it doesn't quarry. There's it. There's that other thing too a regular mirror doesn't do that Perfectly flat mirror would not do that though create a perfect opposite image of you But if you had like some sort of concave or convex mirror, that would you sure about that feelings?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:32.740 --> 0:15:37.262]: 
  It doesn't, Cory. I'm just gonna bring it to you. There's that other thing, too. I regular Mary doesn't do that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:43.725 --> 0:15:58.575]: 
  That was are you sure about that? I'm 100% sure I'm sorry to break it to you. I thought the whole mirror thing. No, I perfectly flat mirror I guess no, that was debunked. Are you saying what if Corey wants to see his ideal self? Maybe I want to

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:54.323 --> 0:15:55.200]: 
  Are you saying that?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:56.770 --> 0:16:01.613]: 
  Maybe I want to also you need to use a concave mirror so he'd be like skin

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:01.360 --> 0:16:13.949]: 
  Okay, well then I'm gonna go get a fucking 3d. Oh to lie to himself. Yeah, but then you're lying yourself And then put a mirror inside of it. Can we go back to the world record cuz that's something I wanted No, you know what back on that thing though. It works with art, too. You ever draw a picture and then flip it

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:03.486 --> 0:16:06.034]: 
  Oh, to lie to himself. Yeah, but then you'll be lying to yourself.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:13.949 --> 0:16:22.859]: 
  I do, I do that all the time. I stream art a lot and they always notice, they always go flip the image now So I flip it and it's skewed always to the left. It's not even your art though

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:19.332 --> 0:16:20.074]: 
  Flip it and it's...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:21.424 --> 0:16:32.055]: 
  It's not even your art though, but if I took anybody's image and flipped it, it would look strange. See, I thought it was my brain. You always flip the image. It happens to me. Anytime I draw someone who's straight up, they're always tilted.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:26.554 --> 0:16:27.972]: 
  See, I thought it was my view. You're always...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:31.262 --> 0:16:34.452]: 
  Why is that though? Is it because your right brain is harder than your left brain?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:34.452 --> 0:16:49.724]: 
  So you like our work harder. Do you know how whenever you see a picture and then like you look at it like so? There's videos of this all the time on YouTube where they have a picture and then they turn it sideways And you see it's like fucking skewed like 16 it looks like a fucking Picasso when you like an image that makes sense to you And then they flip it back

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:44.745 --> 0:16:45.167]: 
  It looks like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:46.754 --> 0:16:46.939]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:46.939 --> 0:16:46.956]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:49.335 --> 0:16:57.435]: 
  I drew some girl today holding a banana making a sand castle for some reason and she flipped and she looked like she was like Yeah, yeah, she did she looked like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:53.537 --> 0:17:01.165]: 
  She looked like she was like, yeah, she did. She looked like she was building a banana and holding a sandcast.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:57.435 --> 0:16:57.975]: 
  Thank you guys.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:58.937 --> 0:16:59.444]: 
  And that's it for this video.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:59.579 --> 0:17:06.176]: 
  hold in a sandcast. No, that was when it was slipped the normal way, but in the other way, it looked like some sort of fucking weird portamento.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:05.130 --> 0:19:15.659]: 
  I always always flip canvas and now in flash I try to do that whenever I'm working on an actual final piece But it really does you can't flip canvas and flash your own you actually can no you can't Jeff told me no you can't We know Jeff told me I can't flip the whole can you flip the symbol? Oh, yeah To me that's a canvas like when I have a character and I can turn it into another definition of a camera No, not yeah, I see what you mean. That's bullshit though. That should be a fucking implemented feature Definitely or rotate the game there or something they should be more optimized for artists man. This is this is yeah, I never mind Like I'm talking about nerdy flash tips now and nobody gives a fuck Go Jeff go Welcome to Jeff's nerdy flash tip. Did you know minute? You know when you draw a bunch of lines, right? And you select them you can then I Always think you to double-click them to delete them. Yeah, or use the eraser use the line eraser tool Yeah, but all you do is actually select everything in your in the on the frame whatever and then go into the color and then hit the You hit the line that the yeah Yes Doodle doodle told me that's what I did with the shade like when I when I draw something and I do like a pencil line tool I do that and that's how I know idea. I was doing it wrong Are you fucking serious? Well, is that what you were talking about just now? It was I mean is that what you were talking about? Yeah, I think yeah You know that kind of happened off and on the entire time I was working at Newgrounds and then I met Jeff in like 2005 and we were already both using flash a lot And then you get so stuck in your own ways like a year would go by and then you know for some reason Jeff would be Standing behind my desk and he'd say why are you doing it that way? You should do it this way That's what you told me when you can remove symbols from the fucking library By simply choosing a little button in your library thing that says remove all symbols are like all unused symbols and all you the symbols that are fucking taking Them 90% of the ghost that is a thing It's like and then control F2 where you can select a single color and change it for change all of them I didn't fucking know I didn't know that until way too late

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:08.286 --> 0:17:08.724]: 
  That's good.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:12.134 --> 0:17:14.766]: 
  But it really does help you. You can't flip canvas and flash or a light.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:17.617 --> 0:17:18.630]: 
  What do you mean by that?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:19.862 --> 0:17:21.516]: 
  Now you flip the symbol. Oh.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:24.569 --> 0:17:25.026]: 
  I have a character.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:26.140 --> 0:17:29.245]: 
  That's not the definition of the camera. No, not the camera. I see what you mean.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:32.620 --> 0:17:35.775]: 
  or rotate the canvas. There's something. There should be more optimize for artists.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:33.295 --> 0:17:33.362]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:38.037 --> 0:17:38.914]: 
  water

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:41.918 --> 0:17:44.449]: 
  Nah, not true.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:00.177 --> 0:18:00.396]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:06.285 --> 0:18:07.264]: 
  the color and then hit

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:09.239 --> 0:18:16.090]: 
  Yeah. And then it goes through the line through the... Yeah. And then it gets rid of everything. Yes. That's what he has to do with the...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:17.136 --> 0:18:17.609]: 
  That's what it is.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:23.093 --> 0:18:23.869]: 
  I had no idea.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:24.780 --> 0:18:26.299]: 
  Are you fucking serious? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:52.185 --> 0:18:53.940]: 
  Oh my fucking god

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:53.940 --> 0:18:53.957]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:04.369 --> 0:19:06.529]: 
  and taking up 90% of the ghost data.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:11.237 --> 0:19:22.442]: 
  I didn't fucking know I didn't know that until way too late. Yeah, no offense, but you don't make that many cartoons How are you so good at using flesh? I've made plenty of cartoons. I did know for like fucking 15 years Yeah, but you don't do many more

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:19.422 --> 0:19:19.827]: 
  Идите!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:20.772 --> 0:19:25.007]: 
  You don't do many more. Stamper's made like hundreds just as an... Oh, you just didn't release it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:25.007 --> 0:19:29.530]: 
  Yeah, I do that too. I can't complain. I actually always do that and I never

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:28.365 --> 0:21:55.499]: 
  I never happy with the product. Anyways, I wanted to talk about, I know it was long and past, but I wanted to talk about world records, because I like. Wait, no, let me finish that up real quick. All right, so in summary, I've been using Photoshop and Flash, probably Photoshop's is like 2007, no way earlier than that. And I learned everything I needed to learn, quote unquote, within the first month, and I never learned anything else about that program. For me? So if I can talk to your friends, they probably have roundabout ways of fucking doing things. That's so true. But it's also different too, because like. I was like, why the fuck am I doing this? There's gotta be an easier way. That's the thing I was willing to learn, sorry. No, no, keep going. I'm not willing to learn something new. And that's like something where I'm very, like Jeff is learning, you were learning like the new Flash, and it's funny how you like set everything up how it used to be. Yeah. Cause I would have, I have the same way. I'll have a fucking like mental breakdown if I get a new Flash, and my fucking timeline is down. I'll be like, the timeline is supposed to be up here, the fucking symbols are supposed to be here. Why is my color theme down here? It just like. Exactly. I mangled the whole interface to resemble the old interface, which is probably like the inferior interface. It's not the inferior, it's the one that works. Damn. It's from you. It works, that's the one that, it's the one that your hands and everything are so used to going to, that it's just been engraved into your head. And that's the same way for something like, pretty much any Flash, like Macromedia I used, when I first started using Flash, it was Macromedia Flash 8. And that's still supposed to be one of the best types. And it was, yeah, and it was good. And then when I heard CS3 was the exact same, aside from a few tablet issues, I was like, okay, and then I got that. And then I saw CS4 and it lost its fucking mind. Yeah. I mean, you could probably set it up how it used to be, but I'm terrified to try it again. It's amazing how many animators are, it's like we're keeping Flash alive on a version that is like a decade old. I've used the CS6 when I do it. People are gonna come into here with their fucking, what are those things where people like walk it, ride them? The segues. Yeah, some asshole segues guys are gonna come in with their fucking like CS10 Flash, and they're gonna be like, wow, primitive, and like fucking like turn the cheek on us. Whatever works, man. It fucking works, fucking. We have a really good image of this. I could use CS3 for the next 50 years if I wanted to. Agreed, I could use Flash 8 truthfully. Or you could just get Toot Boom.

It's like- No, it's just when those like- No, that's not what I mean. I mean, like, there was like a lot of action. Like the most cars jumped and like the longest a guy was lit on fire and shit. Well, no, but they also do shit like- They go all over the world. They also do shit like this kid was shot in their bed. You know what I used to like? From a ricocheted bullet somewhere. Sunday morning, in Sunday morning comics, they always have a little Ripley believe it or not panel where there's like four or five little factoids. I never saw that. Yo.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:03.615 --> 0:31:07.750]: 
  That's a set picture. I wanna fuck the girl with two of this. I'm disgusted by all of this. That's amazing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:07.750 --> 0:31:10.669]: 
  I'm so Jeff No I'm actually fascinated by this

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:10.028 --> 0:31:10.349]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:11.024 --> 0:31:11.378]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:17.841 --> 0:31:20.271]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:27.561 --> 0:31:27.949]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:35.222 --> 0:31:38.378]: 
  Well, no, but they also do shit like over the world

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:43.913 --> 0:31:44.014]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:52.367 --> 0:31:54.274]: 
  Who is the longest that someone who's lived on fire?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:54.274 --> 0:32:00.450]: 
  What and survived? This is the real thing. Is it funny, do you know? How's that funny? No!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:59.337 --> 0:32:02.239]: 
  Nile, are you drunk?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:02.239 --> 0:32:03.522]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:03.522 --> 0:32:03.539]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:03.539 --> 0:32:56.104]: 
  Longest that someone was lit on fire. Was there one fucking Buddha priest who was praying to the gods? He died though, that doesn't count. That wasn't Ripley's, was it? I mean I know it was fucked up and I know it happened. I'm pretty sure he was the longest. The longest without crying was probably good for that guy. How do you... you can't have a... Did he die? Yo, that Muckas Indian style like this with his hands together, he didn't say a fucking thing. You get third degree burns in seconds. Okay, cut out the moment. Something changed. Wait, was that really bad? I was just talking about a person that was set on fire, because I remember watching a race car guy who put on an outfit and caught himself on fire, and he went for like a long time because he was used to racing. What's the most horrific thing you've ever seen? Dominic Toretto's dad? The most horrific thing I've ever seen? Like really fucked up, it's like something that's always kind of bothering me.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:09.377 --> 0:32:09.951]: 
  Like beautiful.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:13.950 --> 0:32:15.149]: 
  That wasn't Ripley's...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:15.773 --> 0:32:18.439]: 
  I mean I know it was fucked up and I know it happened. Nobody.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:18.439 --> 0:32:20.059]: 
  I'm pretty sure he was the one.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:22.506 --> 0:32:23.451]: 
  How do you, you can't...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:25.797 --> 0:32:25.814]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:27.450 --> 0:32:28.463]: 
  I must have had an outfit.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:30.471 --> 0:32:33.762]: 
  He didn't say a fucking thing. That's because he was doing it like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:35.297 --> 0:32:36.462]: 
  subject change

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:47.532 --> 0:32:50.046]: 
  What's the most horrific thing that ever happened? Dominic Toretto's dead?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:48.949 --> 0:32]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:56.104 --> 0:32:56.847]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:57.066 --> 0:33:20.235]: 
  Okay, um, I remember it as a kid there used to be this website where you could doll up dead people and go on dates with them What I'm not even joking. It's better. You know, I regret asking Cory expense. No, no, no, no, no, you can't just open up a can of words What are you talking he asked me and I told you can't

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:07.545 --> 0:33:08.237]: 
  Alright, you know what I mean?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:09.621 --> 0:33:12.608]: 
  No, it's spent on... Corey, it's spent on... No, no, no, no, wait, Corey.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:14.869 --> 0:33]: 
  Still the ones I wear.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:15.494 --> 0:33:18.396]: 
  You opened the can of worms.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:20.235 --> 0:33:22.564]: 
  throw the can of worms out the window.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:21.569 --> 0:33:44.130]: 
  That was a can of worms. I was the worms all over the place. No, leaving the birds to come and ask questions. Worms! Expand on that. I need to hear that. Okay, I was like 13 or 14 and I was curious because it was like, do people fuck dead people when I was little? Google ask jeeves. Do people fuck dead people? No, I went on them. The last thing I was thinking about when I was little was the worms.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:23.982 --> 0:33:26.226]: 
  All over the place. No, you're story was the limit.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:27.880 --> 0:33:29.567]: 
  Expand on that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:42.375 --> 0:33:46.999]: 
  The last thing I was thinking about when I was 13 or 14 was two people fucked dead people

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:46.999 --> 0:35:01.452]: 
  I was watching I was trying to get some honeycomb cereal and watch TV man. That's why your life is boring I was looking at my life is a thrill ride of roller coasters So I okay, so I was on the computer and and it was like this really weird site It was like this really gothic site and and had pictures of a bunch of dead people that had just died That you could pay tons of money to dress them up and go on dates with them And they have specific specific places you could go on dates They showed them like sitting in chairs and stuff and the actual thing was I think there were more options Where you could fuck them, but I didn't read too much into it because I was really afraid that somebody would see me on a page About dead people and fucking and going on dates 14 I was a little startled. You know, it's weird. I understand like fucking dead people But going on dates with them is weird to me. Well, there was like a video There was like a guy who's going to get some shepherd's pie with a dead person. No, it was like what a strange It was like it was like a wholesome dad What you know what you have any people who play in common say, you know, I can relate to those sleepy cabin guys I can relate to them. I think this is like the word You're talking about fucking dead, you know, you're scaring everybody. Hey, I'm you asked What was the most fucked up thing I ever saw? I go back to the relation though. It is true. That was

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:53.766 --> 0:33:55.572]: 
  My life is out!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:36.038 --> 0:34:36.443]: 
  come

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:40.998 --> 0:34:42.264]: 
  It was like what a- The strange.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:44.880 --> 0:34:46.094]: 
  Whatever.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:54.989 --> 0:34:55.882]: 
  I'm scaring everybody out.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:58.600 --> 0:35:10.362]: 
  I can go back to the relation though. It is true. That was... Rotten.com was the worst thing I've seen when I was younger. What's the other side of Rotten? It was Ogreish.com too. So wait, wait, so Rotten.com. And Ogreish was turned into a lively clique later on.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:03.966 --> 0:35:07.949]: 
  We'll see you at the cell right when I was just like- It was OakRish.com too. So wait wait so you're not- Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:10.362 --> 0:35:13.180]: 
  Well, yeah, yeah. I guess... Did it really? Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:11.509 --> 0:35:33.447]: 
  I guess like rotten.com yeah that was bad but for something that could actually like physically confuse me was that I Remember rotten.com. I saw that when I was like probably 14. I was like oh my god This is so violent, but then there was a picture on there, and that was one of the first times I jerked off as well. I gotta say

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:23.069 --> 0:35:24.807]: 
  I was about to say, oh my god.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:29.785 --> 0:35:29.954]: 
  I get it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35 --> 0:35:34.071]: 
  There was a way there's a death you had a prophecy

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:31.995 --> 0:35:37.075]: 
  There's a there's a desk you had a prophecy got a plan for use that those sites had a weird

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:34.071 --> 0:35:50.507]: 
  See, I had a plan for you. Sites had a weird philosophy about them, because they were against, I think, like animals dying and things like that. They just found this weird beauty in watching people die. Yeah, true. You could also choose your category. You could have like fucking new bodies. I went there a few times.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:45.006 --> 0:35:46.440]: 
  Yeah, uh, it's really good.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:48.752 --> 0:35:53.646]: 
  I want there a few times that I I don't like looking at that stuff

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:51.317 --> 0:35:52.937]: 
  I don't like looking at that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:51.942 --> 0:35:58.337]: 
  I don't like looking at that stuff. Like if I watch a guy die on a video, it bothers me less than if I watch a dog die. That's what I'm saying is shit.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:57.561 --> 0:36:12.951]: 
  That's what I'm saying, it strains that most people feel that way. You could watch a dude get his head sawed off all day. It's not saying that it's cool and it makes you fucking sick. Like it still makes you kinda go, oh. But if you watch the dog get, no. I cannot do that. I can't do that. I can't remember if there was like a ratings in a comment section. I couldn't. People could rate it. There was.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:23.185 --> 0:46:33.495]: 
  Yeah, and it's just a mix of fucking whatever. That's fine, but if you're gonna trick yourself then don't eat it at all Like don't get if you want bacon then get bacon if you don't eat bacon then don't eat bacon don't

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:02.993 --> 0:47:32.355]: 
  Actually, didn't they have that thing where our organs are interchangeable? They had a talk with the cannibal. Like a cannibal, and they said it's a lot like veal, where it's based on how you like work the body is how good it'll taste. I'm sure we're in the body like where it we smell like pork. Yeah. Like when you cook us, it's like a sulfur pork. Sulfur pork? Ooh. I need a human steak. I would most definitely eat human. If I had the opportunity, I would totally eat human. I'd only eat human.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:04.495 --> 0:47:05.997]: 
  They had a thing on top of it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:05.997 --> 0:47:08.005]: 
  They're changeable for the most part.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:25.251 --> 0:47:26.736]: 
  بال History

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:25.504 --> 0:47:25.943]: 
  Ready, ready.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:29.672 --> 0:47:36.962]: 
  If I had the opportunity, I would totally eat. I'd only eat human if I was stuck on a mountain and there was nothing up. Why would you eat human? A true life.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:35.882 --> 0:47:44.624]: 
  A truth, I'd be like, this guy had a life, he had a job, he had a wife, and kids. I'd have three questions, I'd be like, how did he die?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:40.489 --> 0:47:41.620]: 
  I have three questions.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:44.624 --> 0:47:47.442]: 
  eight, okay? We'll need them. No, but

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:47.442 --> 0:50:17.089]: 
  What what did he do wrong? He was a rapist and he had AIDS and the third question would be with my party of friends that I brought to this human Restaurant asking if they'd be down to eat some human can I say something about like the whole cannibalism You know in like movies whenever you see a cannibal Such a harsh word. Yeah, but whenever you see cannibals when you see a cannibal It's not hold on hold on hold on hold on whenever you see a cannibal You see like these like really classy people who know how to wine and dine and hold their pinky out properly But then they're like I'm playing like New Vegas and it's like you meet like these guys and they're like talking about like I'm Because the quest is you're supposed to like turn them over to cannibals. They're all sophisticated Yeah, they're everyone's very sophisticated and it seems like any time of cannibals is portrayed in something. He's very like Like actually it's true. I'll say all right. You remember you know, they would be alive. Yeah Yeah, and you know that story wait And then that's another thing too like when you see the other cannibals like these fucking tribals Well, wait, wait, they weren't necessarily cannibals they had to do it because they had to you know the movie alive. Yeah, no I never Fuckin every shuck it's like up. All right, so it's like the alive with the Brazilian soccer team Yeah, Brazilian or I don't know the song soccer team crash on a fucking mountain and Every time I've heard about that story before hearing before watching the movie and they're like, oh, you know They had to eat the dead crew members. I just picture in my head that I'm like, okay It's a little disturbing but how bad could it be? It's like they're probably like cooking meat like human stakes over a fire Wait, are they having a fire? No crash in the mouth. No in the movie if you watch the movie It's really fucking is the one where they crash in the ice mountain, right? Yes, they have to ration off the wine and chocolate Yes, there's no food. Yeah, they did see that movie. They sit down like the Handys or something like the first guy so hungry. He goes over to some dude dead dude And he like rips open his pant leg. He pulls a little chunk out of a little chunk of like thigh It just it makes it so much worse. It's all like fat, too. Yeah, but it's energy Well if somebody was to prepare a human over there and I didn't see anything up and then they handed to me It's like, oh, it's dear. I'd be like, oh, okay, and I would just think that I would have the mindset that it's that well So here's the thing it's like so why can't you go on the opposite extreme? Like you know how vegans never touch anything because they're worried about animals suffering and so on

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:49.770 --> 0:47:53.027]: 
  He was a rapist and he had AIDS.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:59.322 --> 0:47:59.895]:

  They're all sophisticated.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:37.780 --> 0:48:40.311]: 
  That's true. That actually is true. I'll say the opposite of that.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:43.011 --> 0:48:45.137]: 
  Yeah, and you have a story. Wait, wait.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:52.478 --> 0:48:53.220]:

  I didn't say that, but I see it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:40.892 --> 0:49:41.264]: 
  The first

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:46.326 --> 0:49:46.782]: 
  We need to just...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:49.482 --> 0:49:51.102]: 
  Godd....

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:15.435 --> 0:50:18.405]: 
  about animals offering and so forth and so on.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:18.287 --> 0:50:48.713]: 
  But at the same time, if you're an omnivore, you don't give a shit what you eat. Why can't I give a fuck about eating anything that's alive? Just creatures in general. Human beings included. We're all animals, fuck it. What if we had a human? Cory, if you died, I wouldn't let you go to waste. I would eat this shit out of you and then I'd use your bones for a sweet art project with papier-mache, macaroni, and glitter. Do you want me to do the Cory? What? We should have human Cory Sashimi. We started eating him while he's still alive. Sashimi.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:40.545 --> 0:50:42.503]: 
  You're with the crew. You're with the crew.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:42.503 --> 0:50:42.942]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:50.114 --> 0:52:04.515]: 
  I don't know. It's fast, she means. Can you at least put a stick in my mouth so I can like hide the screens? Oh, well, so I'll put an apple in your mouth so I can roast you over one of those turnies things. What's apple in your mouth? What do you think of those videos and the DC sushi chefs? They're so adept at their job. They cut all the meat off a fish, but don't kill it. And they put the fish back in the tank and he squids around. And then they just stick to the bottom with all this fucking like fish blood floating on. Wait, what? Truthfully, it's a little heavy. You don't even see that. That is horrible. Well, you have to think if you do it all day. Yeah, you do it like... That is fucking horrible. But yeah, you're eating the... He has the sushi on the plate and the customer's eating it as the fish that had its meat cut off is still swimming around the tank. And you should have fun fishing your mouth and staring this fish in the eyes as he's swimming around in front of you. No, they... In a lopsided manner. I will admit, that's one fucked up thing I watch on DCW. That is so fucking... It's like, these sashimi videos of like, people are eating a live lobster and the lobster runs off the plate or, you know, stuff like, or there's a frog. They put a fucking frog in a glass. Oh, no. And they pull out his beating heart. I've seen the crab thing. Oh yeah, the frog is staring at you the whole time while you're eating out of his body. Look at his face. He's like, what's happening to me?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:51.632 --> 0:50:52.797]: 
  Can you at least...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:52.240 --> 0:50:52.493]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:55.564 --> 0:50:57.167]: 
  I will slow down a little bit.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:59.260 --> 0:51:00.677]: 
  like it's been happening in your mouth.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:08.997 --> 0:51:13.047]: 
  And then they just sink to the bottom.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:09.992 --> 0:51:10.499]: 
  These are out.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:15.342 --> 0:51:16.118]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:16.709 --> 0:51:19.949]: 
  He's a little bit of a pro to watching. That is horrible. Well, you have to.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:19.324 --> 0:51:24.117]: 
  Well, you have to think if you do it all day. Yeah, you do it all day. That is fucking horrible.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:31.120 --> 0:51:31.947]: 
  And you're so...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:31.947 --> 0:51:33.246]: 
  Go on, fish in your mouth.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:36.469 --> 0:51:39.119]: 
  No, in a lopsided manner.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:38.292 --> 0:51:38.984]: 
  That didn't matter.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:41.127 --> 0:51:41.498]: 
  That is it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:41.498 --> 0:51:42.730]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:00.499 --> 0:52:01.326]: 
  He's body.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:02.727 --> 0:52]: 
  What's happening to me? This is my life now.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52 --> 0:52:36.477]:

It's horrendous. I can't stop watching them. That is horrific. That's what's fascinating. This is what I was going to ask you, Alex. You're talking about frogs. I've been seeing videos of it a lot now of screaming frogs, where you tickle their backside and they go, ah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:07.334 --> 0:52:09.021]: 
  It's an honor to Japanese guys to sit with you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:09.831 --> 0:52:12.109]: 
  How'd you shit? How'd you shit? So what they do?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:13.189 --> 0:52:13.493]:

  That is horrific. That's what I was going to ask you,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:37.337 --> 0:53:20.622]:

  That's insane.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:59.916 --> 0:52:59.933]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:06.008 --> 0:53:09.231]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:10.075 --> 0:53:10.699]: 
  Evelyn- liegenoughs

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:10.092 --> 0:53:10.480]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:31.504 --> 0:55:43.502]: 
  Um, mosquitoes. There's stink bugs. Who somehow are so good at getting into your house, I had no idea. What those fucking orange shit bugs? No, they have like a diamond shell back.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:42.929 --> 0:55:49.611]: 
  Yes, Jim and Sheld, but Jeff, did you know that stink bugs were only introduced into the USA in 1998? Yes, they did. On an Asian airline?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:45.578 --> 0:55:45.595]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:46.894 --> 0:55:48.497]: 
  Yeah, 1998. Yes, there is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:48.497 --> 0:56:13.455]: 
  on an Asian airliner. They're not natives. They're not natives. They're taking over. Stigbuck's never really bothered me. They just kind of slip in under the radar and you see whatever you know again. I don't know how they get inside so well. They get into your house. They're quite big too. More than any other bug I've ever seen. Yeah. And they're always just hanging out on your blinds or just doing something. They're always hanging out on a curtain or a ceiling or on a wall. And they're always alone. They're just like kind of brooding.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:51.366 --> 0:55:52.041]: 
  They're not native.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:52.716 --> 0:55:52.952]: 
  Stay.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:55.804 --> 0:55:57.002]: 
  the radar you see whatever

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:57.002 --> 0:55:57.829]: 
  I don't know.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:01.457 --> 0:56:02.436]: 
  They're quite big too!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:04.495 --> 0:56:06.030]: 
  Yeah, and they're all just hanging

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:06.891 --> 0:56:08.460]: 
  Yes, they're all hanging out.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:10.772 --> 0:56:10.992]: 
  in the world.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:10.992 --> 0:56:17.590]: 
  They're always alone. They're just like, kind of brooding. And they really do live up to their name too. They stink like rotten bananas. I've never.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:16.864 --> 0:56:22.028]: 
  I've never I've never caught any of that. I don't know why they're called stink. I don't think stank dude

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:20.239 --> 0:56:25.740]: 
  They stink dude. No only when you kill them they stink though. They don't kill when you they don't stink when you don't kill you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:25.302 --> 0:56:33.503]: 
  Do you know people who are much more likely to, like they're very ruthless with killing bugs but they want to come across a lady bug, they're like, oh I have to put it outside.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:32.457 --> 0:56:32.642]: 
  Oh!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:33.503 --> 0:56:45.450]: 
  So it doesn't get hurt only because it's pretty looking but that fucking bug has the same brain as a beetle Who's like? Imagine if you were shrunk to the size of a beetle and you saw an actual beetle you'd fucking down like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:37.401 --> 0:56:38.937]: 
  same brain as a beetle who

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:38.937 --> 0:56:39.190]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:45.450 --> 0:56:57.837]: 
  You freak the shit out. That's it. Again, it's like compassion for creatures. Like, everyone smashes a spider the second they see it, right? But then they're happy to go to Red Lobster and eat crabs all night, and they look exactly the same. That's just bigger.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:46.902 --> 0:56:47.357]: 
  Yes, sir.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:47.357 --> 0:56:47.678]: 
  Get it!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:57.837 --> 0:57:15.218]: 
  That's the thing though, I don't kill spiders. I like spiders. I like them. I absolutely hate spiders. I like spiders only because they kill flies and I despise them. But I leave them alone. Like I let them kind of hang out on the corner. Spiders seem to have like a little bit more like of a cognitive ability. Like they seem to kind of be more in tune with life.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:05.785 --> 0:57:09.869]: 
  But I leave him alone, like I let him kinda have spiders seem to have a problem.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:14.948 --> 0:57:17.277]: 
  I execute house centipedes though.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:17.159 --> 0:57:24.449]: 
  How- oh how's that- I love that, I love killing those Those- you put them in a- No mercy Oh I would spray WD-40 on them until they burn from-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:19.656 --> 0:57:21.833]: 
  You put him in it. No mercy.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:24.449 --> 0:57:33.494]: 
  the inside. Oh my god you put them in a cup and then they're just like they just give up they just sit in the middle and they're just like WD 40? Yeah. I don't know. I never did grease it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:29.680 --> 0:57:31.975]: 
  WD-40?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:31.941 --> 0:57:42.167]: 
  I don't know I never did grease their legs so they could run faster man I never did that but as is just an example, but I'd like I'd spray him with bleach. Does that sound better?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:41.391 --> 0:58:03.514]: 
  Oh, wow. They get so big, too. June bugs. I don't like June bugs. They only come out in June. I don't know what they are. In July. They're the ones that they come in his way. That's the southern thing. You and me have different bugs than them. You knock them down, and then they just like lay on the ground, like, just spinning around in circles because they can't get up. Because they're body-weighted. It's awful. Because you're trying to watch a show, and he's in the corner like, oh, my god.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:46.217 --> 0:57:47.044]: 
  I don't know what they are.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:49.491 --> 0:57:50.504]: 
  That's the southern thing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:51.364 --> 0:57:52.208]: 
  up aboveياarother

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:58.975 --> 0:58:00.173]: 
  and Life is Hair all day

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:04.358 --> 0:58:25.958]: 
  You're like, shut up! You're actually screaming at it, because I remember sitting there trying to watch Cowboy Bebop, and he was sitting in the corner. So I went over there fucking stepping on it like 16 times to set back down, and it's like... because you can't kill it, you can't crush it! You have to take a fucking cement block, because their shell is so strong.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:14.517 --> 0:58:15.107]: 
  But I don't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:25.519 --> 0:58:39.711]: 
  When I lived with Chris and Ireland, we had a fly problem and I thought pleasure in killing those flies. Flies are fucking all over me. Like even if no one was in the house, I'd talk to them.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:33.788 --> 0:58:35.054]: 
  The flies are fuckin' on me.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:39.171 --> 0:58:41.213]: 
  We're just having flies, I'm shocked.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:41.027 --> 0:59:02.054]: 
  Oh yeah, they're all like flies. They're all around his face and shit when he was sitting on his computer. I had to kill him But when I like I talked to them I was like, oh I killed all of your brothers What are you gonna do and then like one of them would get away? And I'm like you're lucky if you're gone by the time I come back I think you might have got away, but then if you've been there, I'm gonna kill you. Sorry Chris told the shit

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:00.653 --> 0:59:15.992]: 
  Sorry, Chris told the story while I was away about me waking him up at fucking like 8 in the morning because I was like 3 in the morning probably because I was smashing bugs in my room because some stupid asshole decided to leave a cereal container open and bring in the meal.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:15.992 --> 0:59:21.004]: 
  You do need to rectify that because you actually weren't completely in the wrong there because um

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:21.004 --> 0:59:31.180]: 
  I did not leave a fucking double wide box of Cheerios and leave it open. No, someone said I don't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:29.442 --> 0:59:37.947]: 
  No, someone said, I don't know who said, but someone said on the podcast that you left a bit of rotten fruit in your room, but I think it was actually like rotting cereal in the kitchen.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:59:37.947 --> 1:00:01.605]: 
  That was not me. There was, okay, this is what happened. So just to fucking clear some up, this is another Judge Judy scenario. What actually happened was there was a fucking box of Cheerios that I didn't get because I didn't go downstairs to put fucking cereal down. I had cereal in my own room. And somebody left it there and fucking mealworms got into it and then everyone thought they were maggots, which I thought they were maggots.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:00.627 --> 1:00:10.853]: 
  I thought they were maggots. No, they were larvae, so they were actually maggots, by definition, but they spawned into moths.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:06.027 --> 1:00:07.782]: 
  They spawned. I thought they were flies.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:10.853 --> 1:01:59.494]: 
  Yeah, they were meal moths and those are the fucking worst because What I have this door one of my doors was kind of higher than others It was about an inch off the ground But you got a little light that they could easily see at all times in the day There was tons of them downstairs and somehow like my door was always high enough so they could come inside And I had meal brunt moths all the time But what's funny is I swear to God this may sound like crazy and it might just be a bite But I feel like they were learning like they were learning when to come out and when Listen listen, okay, so after a while I would I would kind of test I would turn the lights off Turn it back on and then when they were all out, right? I would kill them no listen Listen, I would kill them all and I would continue to do this and then I started realizing that I would do this and then I would see them and they would immediately fly into the dark No Yeah, you used to just fly around but then when I turn the lights on they all like scatter into the dark I never heard of the term meal moth I didn't hear about it until they came The cori's are like fucking cori made at living cereals are made of the tiny moths Never in the history of ever has but you live in the know why you had fly problems What it made is because you leave open bottles of blue moon in there and it's nothing with sugar It was not me I had no blue moon in my fucking room My room is completely clean because I made sure after there was fucking meal moths in the cereal that was downstairs There was a fucking group about as tall as a fucking skyscraper in bunk terms See that was not me cori's some asshole downstairs who left the fucking box cereal open my fucking room was fine Cory I actually agree with you that when I cleaned your room out when we moved out No, there's nothing but beer bottles in there filled with but I was after yeah after after they were all day No, I celebrated by drinking beer leaving them all over the place

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:19.594 --> 1:00:19.628]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:19.628 --> 1:00:20.286]: 
  But you gotta know it's...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:09.173 --> 1:01:10.152]: 
  They're like fucking...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:10.152 --> 1:01:11.991]: 
  Things that live in cereals or rocks.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:11.991 --> 1:01:13.999]: 
  the tiny moths.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:13.999 --> 1:01:14.303]: 
  the history of the world.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:46.872 --> 1:01:47.952]: 
  Not when I cleaned your room.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:59.494 --> 1:02:09.940]: 
  Cory like all right, so they're both right. I I'm just giving an unbiased opinion so Cory was not responsible

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:05.991 --> 1:02:37.497]: 
  There was a lot of nods in our kitchen. I'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie. I did have beer bottles and stuff in my room, but that wasn't what caused it. It wasn't what caused it? Because Chris didn't have any in his fucking room. How do you explain that? Because Cork- Zach didn't have any either. Because Chris had raw sandwiches in his room. Yeah, but Zach had like fucking like 16 blue moons on the table counter on his fucking window. And my room had a light underneath because everyone else's room was completely dark, but mine had a light because I was up. You're through the work. Maybe you guys all have confusing problems because I never have bugs in my room period.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:09.940 --> 1:02:10.159]: 
  Did it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:18.698 --> 1:02:21.364]: 
  didn't have one either. Because Chris had raw sandwiches in his room.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:31.860 --> 1:02:33.953]: 
  Yeah, you're through the board.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:37.497 --> 1:02:40.450]: 
  Wait, neither did I, neither did I. Surprise!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:40.450 --> 1:03:04.497]: 
  Jerk! Nice Baba Glasses there! Incorrect! Ah, no! The first thing you said, incorrect. Second thing you said, very true. Here's the thing though. The Mothman problem. Here's the problem. Even if you got rid of the source, they're gonna try and live there regardless. If you got rid of all the wheat, and I did, trust me, once I started getting meal moths, my room was clean of all things. I made sure.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:52.195 --> 1:02:53.342]: 
  The Mothman products.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:03.602 --> 1:03:05.779]: 
  I made sure. Is meal mods an official term?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:05.779 --> 1:03:07.754]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:07.754 --> 1:03:10.892]: 
  Oh, so meal mods is an actual thing. It's real, my brother had meal mods.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:08.969 --> 1:03:41.757]:

I never got fruit flies. To be completely honest, I know it sounds crazy. No, fruit flies suck there. I know it sounds crazy, but I never got fruit flies.

Well at the time my stepdad was a detective and my mom was a sergeant so everything was all about safety so police fucking safety everywhere I went and all my friends just thought I was a fucking faggot because I was going out on a bike with knee pads and I had an orange vest my mom used to do that. I wanted to ride to a friend's house it was like two or two miles away. She made me wear this big orange vest. Exactly dude. With fucking traffic blinkers. When I was a kid my best friend fucking Jerry he lived like three blocks away my mom was like you need to put this on this on this on this. I spent more time putting gear on then it took to get to his fucking house. That was the same for me like when I had to go bike riding it was elbow pads, knee pads, a backpack with like some stuff. That was when you show up to your mom and you're like fuck you mom and then you never have to do that again.

  The other thing though, and I think we brought this up before, but it seemed like there's this golden age of movie making in the 80s and 90s when you could almost feel like the budgets were high enough where the movie had decent effects and actors, but at the same time they were- It was weird, it was so new. They were all under the radar enough where everybody making the movie was having fun. You almost tell people- What else? We talked about that in the car. We talked about how all city escapes now are just these black, sleek businessmen who make millions of dollars. A city life is the luxury. It's not like old 80s movies which is like shitty and gritty and people are real and when stuff happens it actually feels like it happens. Now it's all corporate. And they were so charming too. You watched the movie today, it seems like nobody's having fun making it. No, it's all business. Well, I just feel like it's like a transitional period where most people coming out of college nowadays, they're moving into the industry without much knowledge of the industry. They understand money, they understand what works and they understand what you- Do you understand how-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:09.362 --> 1:15:11.117]: 
  It was weird. It was so new.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:15:15.471 --> 1:15:18.222]: 
  What else we talked about that in the car?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:36.565 --> 1:15:38.100]: 
  And they were so charming too.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:15:40.784 --> 1:15:41.087]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:41.087 --> 1:15:41.999]: 
  It's all like this.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:56.747 --> 1:16:00.494]: 
  You understand how to film things, like they know there's a lot of technical shit.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:58.739 --> 1:17:05.952]: 
  There's the filmmakers and then there's the writers and then there's the people. There's two things they're told. There's two things they're told. They're told what to edit and they're also told where to put the fucking Wilhelm scream in all the latest films. If I even hear that Wilhelm scream one more time. It's in cartoons now which is just like any cartoon that comes out it has a fucking Wilhelm. It is way past overdue. Pretty much the whole umbrella of Hollywood now is revisiting things that they know worked in the past. People laughed at this, people liked this, people enjoyed this movie so let's do this again because we know that works. I'm wondering if they're going to do something with like westerns. Like they're going to revisit westerns? Oh I love that. I love western movies. I think that would actually... I would love that. Well I mean like... I think at least he cares. Yeah, yeah. No I mean like old westerns. Like the stuff that your dad and grandpa watched. Like they're really like... You know movies like good movies from now on all the time. It's like theater movies now. Yeah. There was a millionaries to die in the west bombed. One thing that like 80s movies had that like modern movies don't have is...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:01.641 --> 1:16:03.936]: 
  They know all the technical shit, but they don't know all this.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:16:03.936 --> 1:16:04.999]: 
  Two things are told.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:04.999 --> 1:16:05.556]: 
  up as well.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:11.344 --> 1:16:13.605]: 
  in all the latest films. If I can hear that, Wilhoney.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:14.432 --> 1:16:15.327]: 
  It's even, it's

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:21.857 --> 1:16:22.667]: 
  It's all new.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:40.521 --> 1:16:44.942]: 
  I love that I love Western movies. I think that would I would love that one shot well, I mean

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:44.942 --> 1:16:47.457]: 
  He cares yeah, yeah, no, I mean like care

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:50.494 --> 1:16:51.287]: 
  We need a little light.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:52.975 --> 1:16:54.612]: 
  But I feel like that would be good.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:56.552 --> 1:16:56.907]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:56.603 --> 1:16:57.565]: 
  Yeah, well like

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:05.952 --> 1:17:10.592]: 
  And if you watched a million ways to die in the west in the theater, I didn't watch it in the theater.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:10.592 --> 1:17:46.249]: 
  you do that Corey? Alright I told you why and to be fair I was giving Seth McFarland his first ever chance. He was trying to get me to go. I said no. He had his first ever chance when you watched Ted. I didn't. Oh. That was my first Seth McFarland movie. I can't hate it. A million ways to die in the west fails so hard on every level. I can't even believe it. Actually no that's wrong. The cinematography is alright. Yeah. But it fails the joke. Did he direct it? He pretty much did. He put himself in every shot to make sure that he did. Well then he's a great cinematographer. This is a literal quaffo movie. Such a disaster.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:17:16.887 --> 1:17:17.612]: 
  I'm trying to get

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:19.080 --> 1:17:19.452]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:24.497 --> 1:17:24.649]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:25.459 --> 1:17:28.952]: 
  A million ways to die in the West fails so hard.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:28.952 --> 1:17:30.150]: 
  every level

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:31.146 --> 1:17:31.298]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:37.964 --> 1:17:39.651]: 
  He pretty much did. He put himself in trouble.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:17:40.495 --> 1:17:44.494]: 
  Well then he's a great cinematographer. This is a literal quote.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:44.494 --> 1:17:45.186]: 
  It's a movie.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:45.996 --> 1:17:56.999]: 
  The mayor of the city was dead on the streets. This is literally the mayor of the city He's literally lying dead on the street dogs are literally coming to eat him. How's that fun?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:56.999 --> 1:18:12.017]: 
  Is that when I recorded a whole review? I actually have that. I still have that. Should we put it out? We should release that. You should have some... I should have added that. Why didn't you? We can put it on sleep. I keep asking about it, but everybody's incompetent, so... Wait, who said that? Everybody. You just have to say that.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:58.551 --> 1:18:01.909]: 
  Actually have that I still have that should we put it out we should release that

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:03.175 --> 1:18:05.149]: 
  Why didn't you? We can put on sleepguests.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:10.937 --> 1:18:23.408]: 
  You have just said like I wasn't meant to No no no no no no I'm just No I had it for a long time See I wasn't the one who's meant to edit it I'm not blaming you I'm just saying No I know but I was the one who's meant to edit it But it's on my laptop I get edited easily and put on sleepy cabin Okay

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:12.895 --> 1:18:19.358]: 
  No, no, no, I'm just... No, I had it for the longest time. I wasn't the one who's been... Man, I'm not blaming you. I'm just saying... No, I know. But I was the one who's been...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:22.851 --> 1:18:39.186]: 
  You're too busy getting fucking banned from Twitch. Why are you worried about anything? You got banned from Twitch, Niall? Twice. I was there, I was listening. You're such a fool! You didn't hear about this? I did! Yeah, I heard you were just prank phone calling. I'm Twitch. Prank phone calling, police stations. Niall, I'm Twitch.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:18:28.555 --> 1:18:30.462]: 
  I was there

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:38.444 --> 1:18:41.920]: 
  Jeff I was drunk and I was funny. No, that's like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:41.245 --> 1:18:50.729]: 
  That's like that's like calling 911 and being like What do you think of 911 services police? He called the same police station twice. Nile. When did you do that?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:44.164 --> 1:18:46.814]: 
  What do you think of not living services?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:51.488 --> 1:18:53.800]: 
  uh, quite recently. It was about a couple of weeks ago.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:53.817 --> 1:19:07.317]: 
  Give me that stupid friend of yours. Yeah. Dumbass. Listen, Ollie is a stupid fuck. Now, you know Sleepy Cabin was a real company. You'd be fired right now. You can't do that. Yeah, the first time he got banned, he was drawing a dick.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:07.317 --> 1:19:09.949]: 
  I drew a dick in very detailed penance

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:09.949 --> 1:19:16.885]: 
  You feel like you need to get banned harder the second time. You need to go out. Second time with the Bay. Second time with the Column Escort Turfs, isn't it?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:13.577 --> 1:19:22.740]: 
  need to go out. I was calling escort services and I got banned. The official reason was sexual harassment. Anyways, that's- If there's a third time, I don't know if I'll get-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:21.542 --> 1:21:26.350]: 
  I'm not doing a thing. I'm just slow-flapping your fucking efforts. Well done. Anyways can we get back to baby sitters? I haven't told you my extravagant baby sitters. What was the last thing we talked about though? Baby sitters. Alright, yeah then go on. Okay, so let me tell you about my baby sitters story. Okay, so my baby sitters story starts, it's really weird. I recall a bunch of baby sitters stories. This is one I had that I just- Wait, when you were babysitting or being babysitted? No, when I was being babysitted, I'd babysat before. Like I've babysat my one-year-old brother, that fucking sucks, but baby sit-satted, I guess to be the term you'd say. Wait, how would your brother- Baby-satted? Baby-sat? Isn't it? It sounds like a test. Like sitting on babies? Sitting on babies you crushed yourself. How would your brother- This was my- Okay, so my dad's dated a lot of girls, that's another topic for another thing. Oh, like your half-brother, your step-brother or something. Yeah, he's like my half-brother. Actually, yeah, he'd be my half-brother because my dad dated another chick and then they had a kid. So yeah, he'd be my half-brother. He's basically- I call my brother my brother and my brother my brother. Sure. I don't really call him my half-brother, but I forget his name, God, that's embarrassing. Well, that's not your brother, man. Jesus Christ, man. That's not your brother, dude. My friends are brothers. At least I know my family's name, shit. You can't say it's your brother's name, dude. Well, he is, though, technically, even if I can't remember his name. He's your brother from another. Yeah, he's my brother from another mother. Oh, wow. Is it actually from another mother or another father? Yeah, he's a brother from another mother. Oh, wow. So anyways, that has nothing to do with my fucking actual babysitting story. Anyways, the babysitting story! There was this one chick that was babysitting me and my sister and some other guy and I was arguing with my sister. Stop. You were how old? 14, I think. She was how old? 17 or 16. Was she hot? No. Did she have big titties? I don't remember. She was wearing like, just like the most basics. Her tits were sagged, so she had like deflated tits. That's a little too much, man. Go on. Anyways, you wanted to know the details.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:25.272 --> 1:19:26.183]: 
 謝謝

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:31.870 --> 1:19:35.110]: 
  What was the last thing we talked about though? Baby sitters.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:57.739 --> 1:19:58.465]: 
  big good

  How old is your brother?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:12.977 --> 1:20:14.969]: 
  Yeah, he's like my half brother. All right.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:30.308 --> 1:20:33.362]: 
  Well, that's not your brother, man. Jesus Christ, man. That is not your brother, dude.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:36.940 --> 1:20:39.252]: 
  You can't say it's your brother's name dude

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:43.774 --> 1:20:45.816]: 
  We need your brother for another.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:43.943 --> 1:20:43.994]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:47.892 --> 1:20:48.584]: 
  Oh wow.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:50.052 --> 1:20:50.153]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:27.615 --> 1:22:15.405]:

Oh, I thought you're fighting with your babysitter. No, I was I was being like I'm not gonna do that That's what I was fighting about right and so to make up for that She wanted you to kiss your sister. Mm-hmm. Okay It was just weird and I'm just like I'm leaving. Did you do it? No, I never did I guess I pushed my sister. I pushed her She's like that's not kissing and I pushed her again And she's like I was being defiant and then I went to my room I never told my dad this he just came home. No, I'm thinking I'm missing something I thought you when you're so you were playing Mario all-stars. Yeah with your sister. Yeah, okay And you flipping a bean the whole time Your babysitter was watching that she wanted me to go. I didn't even know you had a sister. Yeah, I did I have a question. Yes, it's the worst. It's maybe on topic off topic But what's the worst thing a sibling has ever done to you? Worst thing my brother knocked my teeth out once

 SPEAKER_03 [1:22:47.434 --> 1:22:47.991]: 
  Mm-hmm.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:22:53.509 --> 1:22:54.505]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:22:54.505 --> 1:22:54.977]: 
  Sister of the encontra

 SPEAKER_03 [1:23:04.984 --> 1:23:05.558]: 
  نعم

 SPEAKER_03 [1:23:21.505 --> 1:23:22.568]: 
  I didn't even know you had it so

 SPEAKER_03 [1:23:25.774 --> 1:23:26.399]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:23:32.760 --> 1:23:33.216]: 
  My brother.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:36.051 --> 1:23:51.374]: 
  Uh... He pulled an axel off a toy, a large toy, like on his car as he's sitting in his little kid. He pulled the axel off and swung it and hit me in the face so that it knocked my teeth out. Oh, really? My uh, stepbrothers smashed a plastic chair over my back when I was little.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:23:45.434 --> 1:23:45.450]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:51.374 --> 1:23:54.917]: 
  I was gonna say something but it's nowhere near that I was I sat

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:54.360 --> 1:26:36.090]: 
  You know those like, sorry, you know those like really like undurable ones that you get at like a Dollar Tree and stuff? They're like really cheap. They break really fucking easy. And then he just like shattered it over my back and I had a long, I had like this huge fucking chair well. That's the worst my suit. My sister, I think she threw something at me and I fucking chased her with a butter knife and she was fucking hyperventilating and I held the fucking butter knife up to her nose. And I was like, if you do that it gives like gritting my teeth angry. A butter knife. Well, I got a couple of stories. Um, probably not good at all. If we're talking about stuff like, I don't know if I said this before, but a go kart fell on my sister. Did I say this? A go kart fell on her? Yeah. From a how, from where? From a height? My dad had a go kart that he used to ride on. At his roof? At his roof? No, he had a go kart and we were riding it around and we were going down a hill and you're not supposed to go down a hill and press, you're supposed to let the gas up and then let the thing go down. And we were pressing forward. And that was really stupid. And we turned and the fucking go kart, like some jackass, the go kart just like tipped over and I crashed and then I blacked out and then I woke up and my sister was screaming. And I, it was like the go kart was on the other side and then I ran around and I saw the go kart was laying on her fucking leg with battery acid pouring into her room. Oh my fucking god. And she, and it just like, you can hear the noises and she was fucking screaming. And I, I ran away. What? I ran, not to hell, you ran the other way. I was terrified. I thought, I thought she was going to die so I could understand that concept. So you had to get away from that. I was, I was so scared, but then I, then like something clicked in my head and I'm like, she could die and I could be in so much trouble. And so I ran back to save her and I guess like the, the fear of getting in trouble allowed me to pick up the go kart and fucking pull her leg out. And that was little. So the idea of that is crazy. We're more concerned about getting in trouble than her actual die. My, my adrenaline was strictly being grounded for the summer. I do remember the most fucked up thing that a sibling did to me, but I can't even fucking say that on this podcast ever, period, ever. I think you remember one of the, uh, the- He did say it on podcast we made this. Oh my, I have never, I've told this to maybe two people. And I'll never tell it to you Corey. Is it the one? You got a big ass mouth. And I'll never tell it to you, Nile, because you're a fucking borderline alcoholic. I'll tell it to Jeff later. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, can I just call it up? Wait, wait, wait, wait, personal secrets. Corey, put it up for a second. That is fair use, the one I said. That's fair use. Corey, put this up for a second. I'm a bore- I don't have royalty for stories, Corey. Stafford, yes you do. Stafford.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:01.212 --> 1:24:01.532]: 
  hand

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:23.875 --> 1:24:24.415]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:33.966 --> 1:24:34.202]: 
  Tschüss.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:24:35.468 --> 1:24:36.750]: 
  It fell on her? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:24:38.505 --> 1:24:40.007]: 
  time for a hike

 SPEAKER_00 [1:24:41.104 --> 1:24:42.049]: 
  I have a roof.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:25:24.844 --> 1:25:25.199]: 
  I will

 SPEAKER_03 [1:25:29.772 --> 1:25:31.257]: 
  So you're gonna get away from this?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:25:45.516 --> 1:25:46.495]: 
  And that was...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:25:50.309 --> 1:25:51.068]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:26:03.252 --> 1:26:03.606]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:06.812 --> 1:26:07.454]: 
  Oh my god.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:26:13.225 --> 1:26:15.452]:

  later than a little while!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:29.644 --> 1:26:31.500]: 
  Corey cut this out for a second. I'm a bore.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:32.209 --> 1:26:32.952]: 
  producer

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:35.939 --> 1:26:40.714]: 
  Yeah? A real life alcoholic is telling a borderline alcoholic.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:40.461 --> 1:26:42.452]: 
  You think I'm an alcoholic now? No.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:42.452 --> 1:26:52.527]: 
  You're borderline too, but you're more you're you're like closer to the border than I am like fire closer That's really interesting. I don't think you're an alcoholic. I think it's not only I used to

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:52.004 --> 1:28:09.764]: 
  I used to respect you about like this much now. You're like down here. You have to start over. I don't think you fucked up right though You're I don't think you're not gonna hold it. Then you grab your beer You're a bluff. You grab your beer right after it. I will tell you the most fucked up thing I did to a sibling. Okay When back to the babysitting thing me and my sister and brother We're always left at home when my parents were at work and we didn't have babysitters or anything because we're all kind of of age So my parents just kind of trusted us and we were always like 14 12 and 9 or 14 12 and 11 or whatever the fuck so my parents just assumed that we were old enough to hold things together And it doesn't sound that fucked up but to entertain ourselves since we didn't have much to do in the way of fun We used to play hide and seek in the house, right? So like my sister would be like, okay You guys go hide in the house and we find you and then um so me and my sister Were it once and we were looking for my little brother and I swear to Christ We were looking for him for like two hours and it was getting to the point where it was like did he fucking leave the house? like we're really upset and We eventually found him it was kind of genius on his part. He hid in the drive

  You got shot in the temple. Nice. You know what? It might be still too early for that joke, my friend, because there are still Abraham Lincoln fans out there. Who's he? Who? In Illinois, maybe. Oh, those black guys that we were talking about. The people with little cabins? That's right. Oh, like the Lincoln cabins. Those are toys! Those are... Hey, Lincoln logs are, you know, Lincoln, dad's a name. Lincoln.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:44:05.597 --> 1:44:06.289]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:44:08.736 --> 1:44:10.947]: 
  All those black guys that we were talking about.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:44:12.162 --> 1:44:16.144]: 
  like the Lincoln, the Lincoln Monk camp. Those are toys, those are. Hey.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:44:17.984 --> 1:44:18.794]: 
  and that's it.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:44:19.452 --> 1:44:22.995]: 
  so they may be a little offended so you just better watch it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:44:22.506 --> 1:44:33.947]: 
  The guy who built the light bulb, the guy who built the light bulb was not Alexander Rambell. He was an Eli Whitning. That wasn't, he invented the cotton, man. Then he invented the light bulb because he was a man.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:44:33.947 --> 1:44:35.365]: 
  It's a good seed of cotton.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:44:36.462 --> 1:45:37.465]: 
  So he makes a light bulb and ding, he sees it and he goes, hey, this does look pretty good. All right, all right. Okay, let it go. Let's see, hold on. I'm not resorting to the internet. I wouldn't if I were you. No, let's see, who invented the light bulb? We just saw this, it wasn't Eisenhower and it was not Abraham Lincoln for fuck's sake. It could have been Robert E. Lee. See the guy, the Civil War guy? No, that wasn't Robert E. Lee. The outlaw, Josie Wales, had a light bulb, but he was pretty good. Wasn't Josie Wales a female? Josie Wales was a fictional Western character who shot lots of people, but didn't even really exist, so nobody actually died. So he maybe invented the fictional light bulb? Could have. No, the guy, it was like Frank Filament or something who invented the light bulb, that's it. Frank, or Paul Platinum, one of those guys, that's it. Invented the light bulb. Well, okay, let's just say that Paul Platinum was the guy that invented the light bulb. Yeah, see, where were we going ahead of time?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:45:38.072 --> 1:45:49.446]: 
  We were talking about something before we got on the track of who invented the light. Treadmills. Treadmills. Treadmills. That's correct. Who invented the treadmill? Uh, I have no idea. George Catton.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:45:49.446 --> 1:45:52.450]: 
  was in the war General George Patton invented the truck

 SPEAKER_02 [1:45:52.450 --> 1:46:35.414]: 
  because he discovered that in war you never get anywhere. So that's why he invented the treadmill because he walked, walked, walked, never get anywhere. Oh, well, I get, there's four of my ex-wives. One of those two has been invented. Because it's an uphill struggle. That's right. Well, that's, the machine invented the treadmill. She had the machinery down. Yeah, you press a button, it goes up in an incline. Oh, like the stair-stappers. That's it. Only it was flat, it's flat, like my ex-wife actually. So you can't get it, yeah, you know, that's it. So was it Alexander treadmill? No, grab something. No, that wasn't it. Who did invent the white ball? Come on, I'm dying to know now. Was it Guy? It was it dude? Name was something, something, and he had specific color of hair.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:46:06.422 --> 1:46:09.443]: 
  She had the machinery down.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:46:12.379 --> 1:46:12.902]: 
  snappers.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:46:18.488 --> 1:46:19.315]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:46:36.021 --> 1:47:22.495]: 
  I'm gonna say Chestnut, all the guys from the 1900s had Chestnut here. Chestnut hair, right, and he wore a specific kind of clothing back then. Like Victorian style 1900s clothing. He had lots of hits here. Come on, come on, come on. And he wore shoes. He wore shoes, and he was an inventor. Shoes with or without buckles. Give me more hints. Thomas, wait a minute. Thomas Edison. Thomas Edison. Edison, invented. No, Edison invented the subway for fuck's sake. It was Thomas Edison. No, Thomas Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson signed the bill for the light bulb. Holy, that's right. That's right. The first bill. The first bill that was set up for light bulbs, Thomas Jefferson had to pay. That's correct. Not the bill, the bill, that too. I think you might be right with this Thomas thing. Thomas, what's the name of that guy, Thomas?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:46:55.360 --> 1:46:55.495]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:46:55.495 --> 1:46:56.305]:

  ایرسین، ایرسین

 SPEAKER_00 [1:47:22.495 --> 1:47:32.451]: 
  Thomas Edison did invent the building process for electricity.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:47:26.460 --> 1:47:27.135]: 
  Yeah, that must have been...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:47:32.130 --> 1:47:57.494]: 
  Right. Bingo. That's why Thomas Jefferson had to pay. The new, the black light, you know, for like the clubs. I do. The black clubs. We dance around in neon clothes. It was invented by Morgan Freeman, I think. And he, yeah, Morgan, and he actually, he did the Dixie Cups. The Dixie Cups. Or those red party cups, where you put the drinks in the red party cups and you have the drinks. You drink the party drink out of the red cup and then you go,

 SPEAKER_03 [1:47:47.723 --> 1:47:48.550]: 
  The Dixie Cups.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:47:57.494 --> 1:48:02.269]: 
  Is there any more? Yeah, that was fun. That whole red party cup thing was a blast.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:48:02.269 --> 1:48:05.847]: 
  What was cool about those is that they were disposable you could...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:48:05.475 --> 1:48:10.943]: 
  Throw him out. Throw him right in the trash. That was on her note.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:48:10.943 --> 1:48:31.446]: 
  That was pretty cool, boy. That was unheard of. Give me one of those red cups. Disposable you say, I'll be fucked. And now if it goes into the trash can. Yeah, that's right. I remember those days. We got extra drunk then because we didn't have to worry about where our cups went. Just throw them in the trash. That's very true. You didn't throw my cups in the trash, did you? You mean those ones we were throwing?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:48:26.535 --> 1:48:26.907]: 
  That's very...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:48:31.446 --> 1:48:35.007]: 
  Yeah. They were glass? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:48:35.007 --> 1:48:39.951]:

It's called the baby-sitter diaries. That movie was always like the stupidest concept to me, and it was always like the most goofiest thing to hear in a conversation.

Listen, so Beverly Hills Cop is in 84, Golden Child is in 86, then Beverly Hills Cop to then coming to America was in 88. So like those four years are pretty good.

  Here's a funny side story about Norbit. If I could sex? No, I knew a guy for like 10 years and he was like one of my best online friends and then he came up to visit me for a while and we didn't have much to do. So we watched Norbit on, I think it was Netflix. Is it Norbit or Norbit? It's Norbit. Terrible. And then he went home and we haven't talked since and I don't know if it was because of Norbit or because of something that happened before. Norbit ends fucking relationships.
