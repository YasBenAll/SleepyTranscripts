  Both of them.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:16.242 --> 0:00:36.492]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense. A world enveloped by a seemingly unending ocean of forests. Buried deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little cabin. And in that cabin...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:00:36.492 --> 0:00:39.293]: 
  It's a bunch of guys, it's a bunch of bullshitter.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:39.293 --> 0:00:52.050]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:15.996 --> 0:01:28.703]: 
  Alright so, welcome to Sleepycast, which is not so special, guess, mixed, since he's going to be around all the time. I'm Stanford TV and I'm here with Psychic Pebbles and Johnny Utah. Hi there.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:28.568 --> 0:01:35.453]: 
  So you guys, you know, this is my first podcast here. I've listened almost like a crazy person

 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:32.939 --> 0:01:37.478]: 
  almost like a crazy person. He does the intro by the way. Well, that'll be dead.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:36.060 --> 0:01:56.142]: 
  Oh, by the way. Oh, yes. Give us some taste of that. There's an island in the ocean and where there's... How do you do that? You're making me look. He's so just like him. Shut up. Hey, were you annoyed when you gave us all those outtakes and you gave us like, for the end, and I picked the one where you messed up?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:43.991 --> 0:01:46.270]: 
  Do that dude, this vlog is so juicy.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:58.386 --> 0:02:25.521]: 
  What was the actual interest that was supposed to sound like? What's the actual dialogue? I just know that I took a lot of takes where I put a lot of care in there and my assumption is always that you guys are going to make me not sound like an asshole. But the truth is, is I was proud that you did make me sound like that because it lowers the bar for the whole podcast because you all sound like assholes. That's right. If we started off as good as I made it, it would just made the whole thing worse.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:18.771 --> 0:02:20.948]: 
  because you all sound like assholes so...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:20.948 --> 0:02:21.505]: 
 拜拜

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:21.505 --> 0:02:22.028]: 
  That's right.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:24.964 --> 0:02:39.949]: 
  Cause he actually did our intro Good like a real good job And he did an old man take another take and another take And he actually did our entire intro Really well that ended like the whole intro But then we used the one where he was like As bunch guys as bunch of dudes

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:27.445 --> 0:02:28.947]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:28.947 --> 0:02:30.010]:

  There you go. Okay, that's fair. Actually, what do I use that? My policy, I believe policy on chocolate, like ice cream and stuff. Because whenever I see chocolate ice cream, I go, it's so tasty, tastes so f***** good. But you get it, it's too overwhelming, you feel sick, you get too much chocolate ice cream. It simply goes with chocolate milkshakes, you know what I mean? If you have too much chocolate. That's what I mean, but it looks so good, it's desirable. The Chick-fil-A milkshakes are... You know what, f***** Chick-fil-A.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:24.683 --> 0:05:35.483]:

I was forgot about it You missed like a one day Oh I can't wait to get that shamrock shake and then you stop in they're like yeah, that was last week No, it's got good milkshakes

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:30.944 --> 0:05:31.939]:

  What? I've never seen you this time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:09.824 --> 0:06:10.499]: 
  Ja, ich fühle mich so.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:11.224 --> 0:06:15.831]: 
  Yeah, you watch it you eating your car or you sitting there who the hell wants to eat how?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:14.447 --> 0:06:31.677]: 
  How do they want to eat their car? Yeah, you get fucking dude, you get french fries and your shit. I never actually ate there, but they put the tray on the side of your window, right? Or how do they do it? How do they give you your face? Well, they use some faggot rules, gets up to your window and trips and gets food all over the place. How do they give you, do they pass it to you?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:29.787 --> 0:06:33.263]: 
  How do they give you, do they, do they? They pass it into your car. Yeah, yeah, see us.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:32.487 --> 0:06:59.858]: 
  Yeah, so yeah, so you push the button. Alright. Or you do drive through. Here's every sonic, you poke the sonic, you have to open your fucking car door because you parked too far away, you press the button, you take 10 minutes to respond, you order your food, so if you skate something, give your food. That's still awkward. Yeah, no, it still doesn't matter. I actually, I never thought about it because I've never been there, but the idea that you're eating a meal by yourself in a fucking car, parks somewhere, just kind of has like a really sad like fucking feel to it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:34.056 --> 0:06:36.250]: 
  Alright. Or you do drive thru.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:44.721 --> 0:06:45.750]: 
  That's still awkward.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:48.012 --> 0:06:48.180]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:53.985 --> 0:06:57.462]: 
  the car parks somewhere just kind of has the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:58.694 --> 0:07:13.155]: 
  Well, you can see they have like picnic tables outside so you get outside, but it's like weather permitting So it's right is fuck. Yeah, because it's really just this a little box that they all cook in all day So you can't go inside right you can't piss there if you need to or anything

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:03.199 --> 0:07:03.435]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:12.447 --> 0:07:19.939]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:25.187 --> 0:07:31.127]: 
  The burgers are messy too. I love the burgers but they are fucking messy. It's like eating a taco in a bottle break.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:29.659 --> 0:07:33.456]: 
  Yeah, you have to bring that shit home and put it on a plate whenever

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:33.119 --> 0:07:39.531]: 
  Whenever I eat at Sonic, I always have to turn my radio on because there's no people in the car I hate the sound of raw like contract confide eating

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:40.240 --> 0:07:45.082]: 
  Well you do fucking assholes always leave trash in my car! I gotta clean up!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:40.341 --> 0:07:41.117]: 
  Will you know?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:41.995 --> 0:10:13.650]: 
  always leave trash in my car. I gotta sleep now. You're not paying me. I have a car. I know it's like people leave fucking wet these bags and I have to leave the car. I know. You leave them in your car all the time. I don't. I don't. You guys do that to me. Every time I have my back seat, the floor is covered in water bottles and gummies there. You're the fucking taxi service for some of these fucking assholes. I hate leaving trash. I don't leave trash in those cars ever. Because I hate what happens to me. That's a fact. You know, I honestly don't know what's worse. I honestly don't know what's worse is that I either have someone puking in your fucking back seat or puke all over the side of your car like when they roll down the window. They never actually puke off of your car. They somehow manage to get all the puke all along the side of your car. You're driving along and it like crusts on the side of your car. I hang out with some interesting folk back in the day. You guys are pretty good about that kind of stuff. I mean, Zach, you know, you at least have the decency to go to the bathroom, but. You puke on the floor. Yeah, or the floor and then lying it for a while. I was trying not to bring up that story because I respect you so much. Did I tell you? I think I told the story. I did tell the story of the podcast. You did? Oh, you did? No, I was going to freak out. Dude, I was there in the bathroom with you, feeding you water, cradling you in my arms, breastfeeding you fucking bottled water to make sure you survived. We're talking about the time I got very drunk in back this. I think I told that on two episodes ago, an episode 40, I think. Yeah, where you were Skyping me on the toilet. Yes, but yes, I think it was nice enough to bring me bottles of water. God bless him. You didn't have to do that. I remember the night before, though, that's where like I kind of wanted to kick your ass was that I had got we had gotten that bottle of Jack Daniels and then you started drinking. Oh, was it Woodford? No, no, no, right. So we had the Woodford, which cost a lot of fucking money, by the way, and then you poured it into a fucking glass. You had a full fucking glass of Woodford. You were already drunk and it was like three in the morning already. And then all of a sudden I remember turning you saying, dude, there's no way you're drinking that. There's no way. And you're like, no, it's okay. I'll get a mixer. I'll get a mixer. So you called room service and it was like $5 for a fucking Coca-Cola and you ordered two of them. And I remember before the fucking Coca-Cola was showed up. That glass was empty. Can I say, I think Drunk B felt challenged by you. You can't drink all that. I was like, don't fucking show that guy. You challenged me. And you showed him. I showed him. Yeah, you sure showed us. I showed you. Oh, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:48.812 --> 0:07:49.926]:

  I'm just leaving you alone.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:09.282 --> 0:08:11.594]: 
  You know, I honestly don't know what's worse.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:20.402 --> 0:08:20.504]:

It's kind of like living in Philly where you see Trash on the ground already in your legs. Should I find a trash can or should I just throw the shit in the street?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:24.180 --> 0:10:24.619]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:46.439 --> 0:11:29.639]:

It doesn't have- It doesn't have like a civilized human being. I'm not a civilized human being. It's like you'll see a trash can, right? And there'll be trash piled all over it. Nobody actually is throwing trash in it. They're just fucking throwing trash on top of the pile. Throw trash at it. Yeah, no. And it's just like it's all fucking gathering all around it. Like yeah, nobody fucking cares. The view the trash can has suggested rather- Right. It's like that general direction is fine. I feel like I'm being a good citizen by throwing my trash in the general direction of a fucking trash can. And make your savage animal. Shut up. You're just farting on people all the time. I too.

  I make sure they hear it and see it. Stamper knows this already. I give people like a three or five second prep where I will actually get into a position where you absolutely know it's about to happen. There's no debate. So it's not like it's a surprise.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:43.999 --> 0:11:57.938]: 
  I was making breakfast, he got in a horse stance and farted. For those of you who are familiar with Japanese karate music, we got in a horse stance and blasted ass. Near the bacon, so some of the particles could have ended up on the bacon.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:57.938 --> 0:12:23.520]: 
  You should be traumatized Jeff if somebody has something like fucking scary buff to attack some skinhead broke into your house and had a big fucking gun in life and you was like walked into your bedroom and you woke up and you said yo piss ass wake up! Did a horse dance! PISS ASS! Did a horse dance in far out and you were left and started giggling with that traumatized you? Exactly! What the fuck? What? I'm kidding! I want to get into psychology! I want to see it happen! You're curious of all the things you're doing to ask me? Smell it!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:09.278 --> 0:12:11.303]: 
 们

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:14.054 --> 0:12:16.568]: 
  I apologize to you. Zach, what the fuck? Why?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:19.690 --> 0:12:20.213]: 
  I wanna see that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:22.035 --> 0:12:40.142]: 
  I'm gonna tell you a story of something that I did recently. This is the most fucking... I shouldn't even be telling this story. Yes you should. No need for a decade. Let's see how surprised I am about this. I'm gonna get crucified for this one. Hashtag stamp or does something.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:31.435 --> 0:12:35.924]: 
  Yes, you should know for a decade. Let's see. Let's see how surprised they get

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12 --> 0:12:34.506]: 
  Let's see how support...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:41.999 --> 0:13:08.054]: 
  Alright so, long story short, not to bore anybody but um, I was drunk much like I am now. I was working well after I should have gone to bed, it's like an hour. And I was pretty fucking toasted. I thought it'd be a good idea, um, also because I'm lazy, but I thought it'd be a good idea to um, not go to the bathroom, but stand up and piss into a water bottle that was sitting by my desk. Also, they hit the toilet.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:48.749 --> 0:12:49.103]: 
  I was

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:06.940 --> 0:13:09.657]: 
  Also, I did have a little opening at the time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:09.370 --> 0:13:15.985]: 
  Now I just pressed my dick hole up against the opening and then sprayed pee into the bottle and filled it up and it was also kind of a scientific experiment.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:15.681 --> 0:13:27.764]: 
  Yeah, I'm gonna say you left that part out you initially told me that the initial impetus for it was to test how big is The human bladder. Yeah, okay. This is a big this is it

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:25.485 --> 0:13:47.440]: 
  This is a big fucking deer park bottle. When you fill a deer park bottle with your piss, you're just like, well, how this was sitting in my body somehow. You're bladders only so big, so it's kind of fascinating anyways. So I went back to work for like an hour and I was so fucking wasted. I was like, oh, dude, you know.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:29.299 --> 0:13:29.940]: 
  All right, here we go.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:46.444 --> 0:13:52.097]: 
  Yeah, no, you know exactly where this is going. Oh, dude! Yeah, you do.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:47.440 --> 0:13:49.499]: 
  Exactly, you know exactly

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:49.499 --> 0:13:56.940]: 
  where this is going dude yeah you do and I was like man if I don't get some water in my system I'm gonna wake up with the worst fucking hell and I just

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:56.940 --> 0:14:05.496]: 
  A clear bottle, it was clear, but it was a clear bottle, yeah. With yellowish fluid. No, but that's the thing, it was, it's warped.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:05.496 --> 0:14:06.441]: 
  It wasn't like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:06.441 --> 0:14:08.432]: 
  It must have had a little tinge to it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:08.399 --> 0:14:15.621]: 
  A little tint, right? But I drank half a bottle of my own piss and I didn't even fucking realize. You got like eight baths in a bottle.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:14.490 --> 0:14:21.949]: 
  Like you got like eight bathrooms in your house. Yeah, well, yeah This is a piss of you don't piss I drank a half bottle

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:21.949 --> 0:14:25.797]: 
  I got on my own piss and I didn't even realize it. I went to bed and I woke up the other day. You didn't just...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:24.480 --> 0:14:31.956]: 
  I won't let you just wait wait so you didn't immediately know you know you do I put it And what you know what the thing is?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:29.189 --> 0:14:38.436]: 
  I put and you know what the thing is I drank yes, you know as much as I could and then it went back for more To get through half a bottle

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:38.436 --> 0:14:46.705]: 
  I thought it was fucking water and I didn't even fucking realize it how it's absolutely you're a jerk acid and you didn't even realize it's are my

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:39.077 --> 0:14:39.955]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:42.402 --> 0:14:43.701]: 
  And how it's absolutely...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:46.080 --> 0:14:48.713]: 
  Are my taste buds that gone? No, it's not.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:47.717 --> 0:15:18.531]: 
  No, and the other thing he forgot to mention was that he said to me I went down to the office And he was kind of like has him to tell me this story I'm trying to bottle my own piss no No, I saw it on his desk, and I looked at it. I was like he may have seen the confusion How far gone are you you fill up a whole bottle of piss and you forget you even did that? You know just what yeah, I was gone Put my hand over there. There's like to be

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:57.555 --> 0:15:01.251]: 
  I tried to bottle my own piss man. No, I remember seeing...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:06.432 --> 0:15:07.259]: 
  My eyes!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:13.587 --> 0:15:14.970]: 
  I was gone.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:15.612 --> 0:15:23.442]: 
  To be fair there's like to be happy that there was just water convenient trust any of you guys There were three bottles of water

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:20.303 --> 0:15:28.437]: 
  I can't trust any of you guys. There were three bottles of water. What are you gonna do, drink my face? There were three bottles of water on his desk. Enjoy your drink, Jeff. And in the back of my hand.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:23.442 --> 0:15:24.960]: 
  There were three bottles of...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:26.192 --> 0:15:26.850]: 
  death

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:27.795 --> 0:15]: 
  And in the back of my mind, I knew that it was like, I was like, okay, there's, there's like three, four bottles of water here. I put a cigarette butt out in one, so I can't drink that one. Oh, see, you already cut it close. No, that's right. And I was like so happy that there was a bottle of water here and I didn't have to go to the fucking kitchen and then I drank my own pa-

  ДИНАМИЧНАЯ МУЗЫКА

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:35.828 --> 0:15:38.292]: 
  Oh, she already cut it close. No, we're a threat.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:42.848 --> 0:15:47.539]: 
  He was like, look at this bottle, there's not an ash or fucking syrup. You know what you're like, you know what I mean? But it is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:44.772 --> 0:15:51.741]: 
  Asher fucking cigarette, but it is and you would think your gut instinct is to wake up and just puke everywhere When you really buddy in your house is a

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:50.543 --> 0:16:01.613]: 
  Everybody in your house is a fucking alcoholic. Except for Joy. Uhh... Or is she? Or is she? Or actually maybe you all are. Yeah maybe. Maybe you are too. I'm an alcoholic.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:59.993 --> 0:16:04.195]: 
  I might have a hole and just drinking my own piss doesn't make me an alcoholic

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:04.195 --> 0:16:19.500]: 
  It kinda does make you a fucking asshole. I had a quick one. Come on, let's be honest. You fucking, you were so drunk you peed into a bottle and then drank half of it. Oh, like you're all so fucking good. I'm so fucking sorry. I never said I didn't, well I haven't drank my own pee.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:06.051 --> 0:16:08.093]: 
  You're the best of all. You're the best of all.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:12.413 --> 0:16:13.459]: 
  Oh, like you all!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:14.252 --> 0:16:15.805]: 
  Good. I'm sorry.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:18.893 --> 0:16:22.926]: 
  Look, I drink my own piss. You touch kids to each their own.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:22.926 --> 0:16:44.880]: 
  I have a question. You know when you eat cake and you wake up the next morning, you had that fucking taste in your mouth? Was that in your mouth? Cake? He did say he had a little... You never eat food and you take an app and you wake up and you have that taste. All right, yeah. Stamper did mention that. I did! You had the fucking piss on me! You had like... Take piss! But I didn't know what it was! I just thought it was because I didn't want to.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:23.989 --> 0:16:24.462]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:30.469 --> 0:16:32.781]: 
  cake he did say he had a little

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:35.295 --> 0:16:35.937]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:35.937 --> 0:16:39.497]: 
  Yeah. Stamper did mention that. I did. I did mention that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:37.067 --> 0:16:37.135]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:37.945 --> 0:16:38.485]: 
  implies

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:42.062 --> 0:16:50.449]: 
  But I didn't know what it was! I just thought it was because I didn't brush my teeth before I went to bed. He didn't! Turns out it was piss! It was piss! Who knows? I'm good.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:46.399 --> 0:16:58.161]: 
  Turns out that's the house piss. It was pissed. Who's that? I'm just curious like how sick can that make you drinking a bottle of your own piss I mean he could have bottles of all these only half. Let's be your own

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:49.943 --> 0:16:50.584]: 
  Thank you, I love you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:56.136 --> 0:17:08.219]: 
  Oh, there's only half. You can drink your own piss. Now, would you judge me more if it was somebody else's piss? That's the question. A little bit. No, I am curious though. Maybe 20% more. I'll say there you go. Because they always say that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:02.920 --> 0:17:45.512]: 
  Little bit no, I am curious 20% more I'll say there you go because they always say that piss is sterile, right? They say pee is sterile. No, I mean piss is just the stuff your body doesn't want. Yeah I don't say it's sterile. It's no good. No, but I've heard it's an idiotal shit. Yeah, but shit ain't sterile You piss and shit is everything it's a getting rewit. You drink it eat your body sucks it up I'm not disagreeing with you that they're both disgusting That's what I yeah waste but I've never I understand his waste But I've never heard the phrase that shit is sterile. I have heard the I'm sure this is sterile. You can take a bite of a nugget be safe. You might get a little bit nauseous Yeah, but if you're in the desert, you might fuck up your tooth from a piece of corn. You should have

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:05.146 --> 0:17:05.502]: 
  percent

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:13.703 --> 0:17:15.946]: 
  Yeah, someone is a sterile. It's no way.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:23.980 --> 0:17:28.637]: 
  I'm not disagreeing with you that they're both disgusting. That's what I've... Yeah, it's waste. Yeah, but I've...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:35.067 --> 0:17:37.952]: 
  I should see, I should see. That pisses sterile.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:40.821 --> 0:17:42.897]: 
  Yeah, but if you're in the desert

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:44.955 --> 0:17:50.204]: 
  You should have. If you're in the desert and you're dying, you could drink your piss to survive a little bit. You can't eat your shit to survive.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:50.980 --> 0:18:11.601]: 
  You should get that machine that Kevin Costner has at the beginning of Waterworld where he pisses right here. Dude, you don't even need it. All he has to do is piss in a bottle and drink it. In Waterworld, if Kevin Costner took a dump into like some big plastic container and came out as like a fucking vegan burger, it would just be like all the good bits that you eat from that burger. So at the beginning of Waterworld, you see Kevin Costner.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:51.942 --> 0:17:52.448]: 
  EUT を

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:52.448 --> 0:17:52.904]: 
  I don't want to play.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:54.490 --> 0:17:55.992]: 
  It's fake!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:55.992 --> 0:17:57.004]: 
  He's a dump.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:07.973 --> 0:18:23.650]: 
  here's my question from that burger so at the beginning of water world Kevin Costner piss into this machine that's a first scene yeah yeah and then it like cycles it and then he could drink it right he's in the fucking ocean why didn't he put ocean water in there to boil it or something why do you have to be

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:13.305 --> 0:18:13.845]: 
  That's a first.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:14.554 --> 0:18:14.942]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:21.186 --> 0:19:39.942]: 
  Boil it or something. Why do you have to piss to get his water? The process of removing salt from water is a really difficult one. But removing the fucking piss from a piss is... I think this is water, really. I think purifying urine is easier than purifying salt water. All right. All I remember from Waterworld was that he made like 80 million dollars from that movie and the movie made it zero dollars. I didn't hate the movie at all. I thought it was kind of fun. I mean, yes, yes, the guys riding around on the jet skis with their fucking smoky goggles on, looking at the grass holes. It was mad max on water as far as I was concerned. It was like that's kind of what it was. It was like this dystopian future. It was creepy. Like all the dead, they dump all the dead bodies into this vat where they just like decompose into like fuel, right? Like applesauce, basically. They just eat decomposed people applesauce. Do you see that movie Snowpiercer? Yeah. So that was kind of like that, right? They were throwing all the rats in the machine. Spoilers! I didn't see it. Oh, who fucking... You know what? Everyone was talking about how good it was. I thought it was all right. I thought it was all right. I thought it was trash compared to everybody saying it was the best next thing. See that's the thing.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:30.636 --> 0:18:36.154]: 
  but removing the fucking piss from a piss is

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:47.545 --> 0:18:49.283]: 
  Zero dollars.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:50.582 --> 0:18:53.670]: 
  ni karşıem ni andra Ä arthritis

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:00.083 --> 0:19:01.180]: 
  Dude, it was

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:21.750 --> 0:19:22.341]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:27.724 --> 0:19:28.332]: 
  teacher

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:27.741 --> 0:19:27.994]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:31.555 --> 0:19:34.913]: 
  I thought it was alright

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:39.942 --> 0:19:56.834]: 
  Like with Waterworld, like with Waterworld, like it's not a bad movie, but compared to the budget and everything, like that's what people compare it to. What do you think of it? If Waterworld just came on TV one night, you'd watch it and be like, oh, I'll fuck them because the movie's so...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:41.764 --> 0:19:42.912]: 
  I'm white breading.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:50.995 --> 0:19:51.940]: 
  What do you think of the...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:51.940 --> 0:19:52.193]: 
  No, it's not.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:55.214 --> 0:20:19.564]: 
  She's fucked up because the movie itself is the exact same. The content are no different than what you watch it differently. It's the same movie. So I always think it's kind of a fairer judge. Everyone does, I do it. It's kind of a fairer judge based on the reputation it has rather than the contents. Like imagine if you made a film and everybody was like, everyone said the movie fucking sucks. It's like it's not their fault that they made the movie they wanted to make. That just happened to me last night.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:04.849 --> 0:20:06.030]: 
  Whatever it does, I do it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:10.620 --> 0:20:11.464]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:17.978 --> 0:20:34.448]: 
  That just happened to me last night. Mick was like, hey, have you ever seen this movie, The Grey with Liam Neeson? Oh, yeah, the whole movie. Yeah, and then I was like, no, I never watched it because somebody told me it sucked. And then I watched it last night, and I was like, you know what, that's not bad. So I was like, you have to make a point. You have to play out your mind.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:23.665 --> 0:20:25.133]: 
  Oh, wij hebben alles gevoeld!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:31.950 --> 0:20:37.300]: 
  So I was like, you have to make a bottom-fuckin' mind. But if you're totally the best movie of all time, be watching the fuck down movie. Well, yeah, it's like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:36.574 --> 0:20:41.299]: 
  So in bottom line you should never listen to fucking anybody and you should take your fucking mind

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:39.915 --> 0:20:43.054]: 
  Yeah, walk in, walk in, it's the way every movie sucks.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:43.020 --> 0:20:46.379]: 
  Look at the trailer for the grain.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:46.379 --> 0:21:10.493]: 
  watching this movie I will say the most interesting thing about watching the grave was a stamper pointing out the fact that he thought Liam Neeson's name came from half of the word William it does come from half okay all right hold on and that halfway through the movie you were like I think people should call me Liam stamper a minute later you're like fuck that that's dumb don't call me Liam his name is William Neeson

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:57.128 --> 0:20:59.406]: 
  It does come from half the game, Willie. Okay, alright, hold on.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:10.493 --> 0:21:19.926]: 
  So he Instead of going with will he went with Liam he just took the last half

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:11.624 --> 0:21:15.876]: 
  Well, he was an Irish, right? That's what I thought. I thought it was just like, no, that's an Irish.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:19.926 --> 0:21:30.422]: 
  Somebody in the comments is gonna have to clarify that. Because none of us did the research. Did you do the research on that? Yes! Okay, never mind then.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:23.774 --> 0:21:25.444]: 
  No, it don't have to clarify that stuff.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:24.162 --> 0:21:25.579]: 
  It doesn't have to clarify.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:28.634 --> 0:21:32.262]: 
  Yes! Okay, never mind then. I'm just spilling shit out of my ass?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:14.044 --> 0:22:19.883]: 
  That's not the most boring way. Would you stop insulting Liam Neeson on our protest? Yeah, when you said boring way, he...

  I grew up in a clot of cigarette smoke so I can breathe like shit. That's right. Torrance. I grew up in Asia and everybody fucking smokes so I feel like- Yeah, it's fucking polluted too. It's disgusting. If you go to China in like the tourist book, they tell you at the back, if you develop a cough, like you've got issues with your lungs, it's not that you're sick. You're just breathing the air. That's literally in the tourist books. What good shit are you? Bitch. If you have pain in the back of your eyes and you're full of dizzy. What is with Chinese- I keep reading about how Chinese people going on vacations, they they're like shitting in the streets and they're just acting like animals. Okay. You think- I don't know if you were trying to be funny or not, but when I went- No, no, no, no. I went to real. Nope. When I went to Beijing, absolutely, I saw a mother holding her child over the sidewalk. So she's on the sidewalk. And it- yeah, it's William Neeson. Yeah, see? Jesus Christ. Okay, good job. You proved me wrong. Anyways, in China- See, I came back to the shit and- No, we were at a bus stop. And I remember seeing a lady hold her child over the sidewalk. He's naked, butt ass. She's just holding him and his poop coming out of his butt. Just right over the fucking sidewalk. But this is just what I read today. Thailand was managed- like this is a mandatory giving all Chinese people coming into the country pamphlets on how to not creep in the streets. It's like a fucking animal. Yeah, no, it's because in some parts of China they still fucking poop in the streets and they hold their kids over a fucking gutter or the fucking sidewalk.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:38.605 --> 0:23:41.288]: 
  Yeah, it was fucking polluted too. It's disgusting.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:26.335 --> 0:34:27.449]: 
  All right.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:34.518 --> 0:34:34.873]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:35.937 --> 0:34:38.451]: 
  It's Chinese stereotypes, go!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:37.893 --> 0:34:54.786]: 
  Big teeth of small braids, fucking small dicks. A yellow hat. Those little symbol hats. Little bull haircuts. Little bull haircuts. Eating rice. And then you view the world in widescreen, cause your eyes are stinking. Little tip running around in rickshaws all day. Rickshaws?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:34:55.764 --> 0:35:27.372]: 
  So I always had this concern that if I was in line, right? If I was in line to go get like a fucking pizza or movie ticket and there was somebody of a different race, whether they're Indian or Chinese or whatever even though I'm Chinese, no one thinks I am, or they are black or whatever and they cut in front of me and I was like, what the fuck asshole? And then like all these people would turn around and be like, what the fuck you call that guy? I just had this fear that I can't even fucking say that to somebody because I'm gonna get fucking pinned as being a racist even though the truth is that nothing to do with race, it just had to do with somebody being a asshole Welcome to the video of 15

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:26.022 --> 0:35:33.278]: 
  You need to look more Chinese because if you were super Chinese you just get away with that's right. That's right

 SPEAKER_01 [0:36:20.646 --> 0:37:58.521]: 
  I mean, yeah, Zach looks like a fucking Jewish Nazi, but most of us look like... Yeah, Jewish Nazi. This is Huxymoron. Zach likes to talk about the gift I gave him. Yes, Jeff, tell Jeff gave me a gift that he didn't want. I have a picture of my computer somewhere of Jeff holding a fucking Hitler youth knife very creepily in his dark apartment over his keyboard. It's the funniest picture ever. Here's the story. Here's the brief story. I have... My grandfather was in World War II and he had a Hitler youth knife that he got from the war and he used it to open letters. He used it as a letter opener. Which I believe has... It looks like a rust, but it could be dry blood. I don't know. And who knows? Yeah, there's some kind of dried substance inside the blade of the knife. He gave me a number of things from the war. He gave me like a samurai sword and like those... What?...Cuckoo knives or whatever and like a wooden chest and all this other shit, but he gave me this fucking dagger. How did he give it to you? I want to know. Was it like, Happy birthday! Here's a fucking... Actually, actually......Ari-Kari knife from a Japanese dude I murdered. After he passed away, my aunt gave it to me because we're like, well, he opened letters of this and we don't... They're like, they're uncomfortable having this fucking Nazi dagger in their mouth. So they just give it to the kids. Jeff, you could go and have some kids. Here you go. Happy birthday. Take this shit. Yeah, yeah. We feel guilty having it on us. Yeah, they knew I'm a terrible person. That's right. So they're like, well, we'll give it to you. And then I actually... Because it was sitting on my desk in my place and I was getting uncomfortable with it. I'm just like, I don't need people coming in. I've played this and seen this like little knife with a fucking swastika on the handle. So I'm like, well, Zach hates the Jews. That's right. That's right. I'm kind of stabbing jewels. Yeah, that's right. Stop. Stop. Stop.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:25.962 --> 0:36:27.953]:

Regardless, you should get your perspective because I need- I need- I think it was the last one. I was surrounded by you, Chris and Niall. Okay. All by myself.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:23.492 --> 0:42:31.305]:

I'm gonna keep no same subject We know yes, just to go back to the podcast we recorded last week that has an air get other to these two their perspective on What is what is gay and what isn't gay? Okay, Zach? Stupid stupid. No, no

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:50.864 --> 0:42:52.247]: 
  We know.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:01.039 --> 0:43:02.204]: 
  Okay. Zack.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:01.090 --> 0:43:01.950]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:06.456 --> 0:43:14.944]: 
  Wait, so wait, oh it stopped. So you guys recorded this one. Yes. You haven't released it yet No, okay, so this is like a trailer. This is like the

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:14.944 --> 0:43:22.572]: 
  The-the teaser, don't give too much away. Yes. Okay, no. There was a-there was a premise. I don't wanna rehash this bait though, because- You don't have to rehash shit, shut up.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:17.762 --> 0:43:18.758]: 
  Okay, no.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:19.382 --> 0:43:19.635]: 
  안녕!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:20.918 --> 0:43:21.424]: 
  You don't have to

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:22.504 --> 0:43:26.082]: 
  Zack is gonna lose this argument and you'll see what?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:25.221 --> 0:44:19.947]: 
  You'll see what? You've seen every argument so far, so you can't... Let's keep going! I think Jack and I were roughly on the same page. Yup, we were. Wait, which... Wait, stop. Which page? The premise was... It was sucking your own dick gay. No! It's not gay to suck your own dick. I don't think it's gay either. Why? Because if you're willing to touch your own dick... Everyone says that, but here's my argument. Hear me out. If you're watching porn, you can phase the hate out. You're looking at fucking tits, or whatever, you're looking at sex. How can you phase out a dick, a fucking hard dick in your mouth? If you can maintain a direction with a dick in your mouth, you're gay. I don't think so. And by the way, and how can you watch porn with a dick in your mouth? Jack, you know what? With your dick sweating, dirty spaws in your face. You're gay! You know what? You're gay! Jack, you're talking out of inexperience because the truth is... I'm sorry, you suck your own dick. No, have you... I used to be able to.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:29.119 --> 0:43:31.802]: 
  I think Jack and I were in the same page.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:30.655 --> 0:43:30.975]: 
  the same

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:36.848 --> 0:43:40.223]: 
  No, it's not gay to say it. I don't think it's gay either.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:37.439 --> 0:43:37.945]: 
  NO!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:01.705 --> 0:44:01.941]: 
  아 다행이다.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:01.941 --> 0:44:02.295]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:04.928 --> 0:44:08.674]: 
  Zach, you know what?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:10.362 --> 0:44:11.813]: 
  You're gay, dad!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:16.082 --> 0:44:16.707]: 
  I'm so used to this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:19.947 --> 0:44:29.447]: 
  I was younger have you jack gay isn't a switch that you could turn off it on look if I'm spending

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:21.769 --> 0:44:21.955]: 
  No!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:26.292 --> 0:45:05.762]: 
  You're probably trying to rip up a room, I'm not fucking gay. I'm gonna blow myself jerking off. This is my point. You could be gay straight or bisexual, you could be a lot of different things. But an act is gay or straight. An act is not the person. Right there. If I'm gay, I don't think so. Here we go, here we go. So being gay is one sex doing something for the same sex. That is a gay act. You could be bisexual, do a gay act. You can maybe even be straight to do a gay act. I'm not saying you're gay if you suck your dick, but it's a gay act. No, you know what? You're splitting it, you're splitting it into homosexual and heterosexual. I think there's something called solo sexual. No. I know, listen. What if you touch yourself?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:39.049 --> 0:44:41.850]: 
  Right there, too! It's fun! I don't think so!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:53.984 --> 0:44:55.435]: 
  No, it's irk, you know what?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44 --> 0:44:57.932]: 
  No, you know what? You're splitting it into whole...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:02.995 --> 0:45:09.981]: 
  Yo listen, what are you doing in the privacy of your own room is disgusting and nasty and everyone fucking does it?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:06.994 --> 0:46:24.940]: 
  This is disgusting and nasty and everyone fucking does it. Let's say if you're gay you better say the act itself is gay. It is literally by definition gay. I am a man and when I touch my wiener to jerk off that gay. That would be gay. That would technically be gay. I was thinking- You can phase it out! When you're watching- Oh, what are you watching? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! You're gonna say- Hold on, hold on. You're gonna say that you can just phase out homosexual acts. No, the hand. Hold on, are you telling me- Are you telling me you get off to grab me a dick? Dude, you're watching- My own! Just my own! You're watching a porno with a wiener going in and out. You're staring at this dude's dick. Is that gay? Nick. Uh-oh. What? You tell me, you just said- Uh-oh. You- you- you consciously imagined your dick and your hand. Like you focus on grabbing your dick when you masturbate. I don't focus on it, but it's there and it's doing it and I'm doing it. It's a sexual energy, yeah. You can maintain a direction while focusing on grabbing a dick. That's right. I can focus my energy while grabbing my own dick. That's what's called fucking jacking off, Zach. You're getting turned on by grabbing a hard dick. No, my dick, specifically. You're defeating your own argument. Yeah, that's right. You're saying- Oh, Zach, we can see you back into a corner right now. Like it wasn't me, it wasn't me, it was the Phantom Hand. You're being teething. Hey, when you're wiping your ass, do you think that's gay?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:21.912 --> 0:45:24.696]: 
  He's been paged out! What are you watching? What are you watching?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:29.995 --> 0:45:32.695]:

  My own!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:37.943 --> 0:45:41.520]: 
  with a wiener going in and out. You're staring at this dude's dick, is that it?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:41.520 --> 0:45:43.529]: 
  Nick! Uh oh, what?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:05.230 --> 0:46:05.871]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:10.005 --> 0:46:13.937]: 
  Specifically. You're defeating your own argument. Yeah, that's right. Because now you're saying...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:16.047 --> 0:46:20.772]: 
  to a corner right now like it wasn't me it wasn't me

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:20.772 --> 0:46:28.484]: 
  It was the Phantom Hand! It's pretty teeny though! Hey, when you're wiping your ass, do you think that's gay too? Because a dude is touching your asshole? No, it's completely different. Look.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:27.994 --> 0:47:29.942]:

  I have said it, you keep ignoring it. No, no, no, we have to do this. Dude, you've got like deep-seated issues right now. Are you like questioning whether you're fucking... You know why I fucked this.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:52.049 --> 0:48:32.144]: 
  I like If you could suck your own dick you wouldn't be talking right now because you have your dick in your mouth right now Consistent consistent you guys like well, it's only gay if you can hold the dick you know But what was your dick, but it's not gay if no you guys are consistent. I am consistent I go to sleep like a baby and by the way when I sleep there's not a dick in my mouth So if I go into my bedroom and I put it a butt plug up my ass and put high Yeah, okay now I would say if you're big the size you put a dick up your ass that makes you get yes

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:55.440 --> 0:47:55.778]: 
  Bye!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:00.790 --> 0:48:04.013]:

  I can hold it up.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:26.693 --> 0:48:28.212]: 
  I would say, I would say, I would say.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:28.212 --> 0:48:29.984]: 
  you betere sorry

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:32.312 --> 0:48:42.606]: 
  Yeah, okay, I see what you're saying now. So your whole argument is fucking bullshit. What's- what is that? Because you're saying blowing yourself is fucking gay, but now there's like, no! Faraday- no no no no no no no!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:34.574 --> 0:48:35.940]: 
  But your whole argument is fucking...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:40.547 --> 0:49:01.945]: 
  NO! No, no, no, no! I said it's all the mentality, that's the way it all can be consistently. I said, well you messed with me! That's never been your fucking consistent argument! Yeah, that's right! You listen to the tape, rewind that, Mick! I'm not. You're stupid now. So, then you asked a question, so... Touching your dick is a game! Sucking your dick is a... No, no, no! Unless, unless you're getting off to grab your dick. NO! So your question...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:46.386 --> 0:48:48.799]: 
  That's never been your fucking consistent argument!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:52.259 --> 0:48:53.406]: 
  So then you I

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:00.089 --> 0:49:16.440]: 
  No, so your question is literally if you blow yourself and you like to taste the dick and you enjoy blowing men You're gay. Yeah, then yeah, I agree if you want to lose your dick bill because you took a concept

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:11.395 --> 0:49:12.846]: 
  Why you guys throw dick build?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:14.331 --> 0:49:36.960]: 
  concept I love touching my own winner I do not want to touch any other man's weiner may I may like sucking my own winner if I could but I can't but I promise you I do not want to suck any other man's weiner and it's not because I think I'm better than anybody all you're doing is just

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:16.440 --> 0:49:17.774]: 
  мо虹 за

 SPEAKER_03 [0:49:20.946 --> 0:49:23.292]: 
  Touch any other man's wiener.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:33.535 --> 0:49:40.116]: 
  better than anybody. All you're doing is just like the gay mindset like if I want to blow a guy I'm gay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:38.007 --> 0:49:47.828]: 
  Like if I want to blow a guy, I'm gay. Would you 60 like a guy if he blows your dick while you blow his? No. What's the difference? The difference is it's not my dick. I see it's no different if you're gonna do the same thing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:47.693 --> 0:49:49.499]: 
  No, your initial argument is just not...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:49.499 --> 0:49:53.447]: 
  nonsense it doesn't make it so muchality if you're getting up to the idea of a different

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:50.511 --> 0:49:51.372]: 
  It's all the Tony.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:53.447 --> 0:50:02.492]: 
  Zach, your argument is seriously like this. Hey, uh, if you really want to suck a dude's dick and you blow him and you enjoy it. I'm sorry.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:02.492 --> 0:50:30.994]:

  It's jizzing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:30.994 --> 0:50:35.939]:

  There's no way.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:24.505 --> 0:51:29.702]: 
  Let me deep-dump your entire question right now before you move on to the next topic. Alright? Fuck you guys, yes!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:28.504 --> 0:52:08.447]: 
  Fucking guys in the ass, it's true as long as I pretend it's not gay. You're in the closet, Stipper, you're in the closet, admit it. Zach, if there was a clone of you, a straight up clone, how would you fuck your own clone? Fuck you, and suck you in clothes, dick, gay? Would you let your... hold on, would you let a clone of you... What if you're fascinated with being gay? Like, you have problems, man. No, not people. The act is the act gay. Not as a person gay. What problems does it solve if you had the answer? Like, it's just debatable. But that's what it is, we're debating it. It's suckin' your own dick, is that a gay act? Hey, listen, I'm not gay, but I'll suck my own dick with you in... I'm not gay, but I'll fucking do it in the ass and he'll let me kill my own ass.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:38.579 --> 0:51:41.920]: 
  And WE'RE VoilàVouzS

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:47.387 --> 0:51:49.092]: 
  What if your fascination would be...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:50.661 --> 0:51:51.336]: 
  brilh

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:08.447 --> 0:52:12.801]: 
  Now you're just stretching fucking Sarah Palin fuck you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:11.468 --> 0:52:29.052]: 
  It was a very divisive topic. We were saying like if you had to be if you made a clone yourself Court man. I mean, you don't never fucking know. First of all, I was totally fucked myself I would totally fuck my clone. It was around the same page. I would fuck my clone to be honest. You might have sucked your dick.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:18.994 --> 0:52:21.677]: 
  First of all, I was totally fucked myself.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:23.432 --> 0:52:25.778]: 
  Because we're on the same page. I worry about you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:28.208 --> 0:52:35.447]: 
  I might let a clone suck my dick, but I would not fuck my clone. No, truthfully, I would try to fuck my clone, but it would get really weird and we probably would never do it. Corey! Corey!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:30.064 --> 0:52:31.364]: 
  We're not fuck our lives

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:34.570 --> 0:53:20.436]: 
  Cory was, oh my god, where do I even begin with that? He was saying like- Cory was saying that you could fuck and suck your own clone. But he's like, what, it's not your clone. It's you from a mirror universe. It's not your clone, but it's you. Yeah, you tried to be a fan. It's you, but it's not you. It's like this deeply philosophical shit going on. Therefore it's okay. Was that the justification for being okay? Yeah. Consider it wasn't- But if Chris said if your body split in two years and that sucked your dick and you went back to one person, then it's not gay. I was looking at it like it's not fine. Well, yeah, so if that was the case, then it's not gay, then that dick won't you again. I think that is gay. Chris said it was gay. You're both you. You're not a clone. Exactly, you are so wrong. It's like the weirdest poem that you ever watched. And you'll see why. You're gonna feel stupid. Our loyal followers.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:38.400 --> 0:52:39.295]: 
  What do you say?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:45.420 --> 0:52:46.500]: 
  Not your clothes, that's yours.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:46.500 --> 0:52:47.952]: 
  И вижу, типа...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:51.698 --> 0:52:53.335]: 
  Therefore, it's okay.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:55.529 --> 0:52:56.642]: 
  Hello.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:03.595 --> 0:53:10.935]: 
  I was looking at it like it's 5. Oh yeah, so if that was the case, then it's okay. Then that'd be much better.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:10.935 --> 0:53:11.492]: 
  It is good.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:13.365 --> 0:53:18.141]: 
  You're not it's not a crime. You were so wrong. It's like the weirdest policy. Why?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:20.436 --> 0:53:27.962]: 
  Of course, they're gonna write out nice little paragraphs as to why you're a fucking dumbass, dude. Your whole theory is so twisted, broken.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:25.330 --> 0:53:40.855]: 
  theory is so twisted, broken, he is semi-consistent, he's not totally consistent with your bullshit theories. Kind of yeah, sort of. See yeah, semi, you are obsessed with this stuff though. You brought it up, I didn't bring it up.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:34.729 --> 0:53:37.952]: 
  Yeah. Sort of. C-S-M-I kind of sort of. You are obsessed with that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:41.462 --> 0:54:03.484]: 
  I'm gonna throw the next person to you. Sabrina, I don't know if you're... Sabrina's like, do you think Zach hates gay people? Really? She said that to you? A little bit, yeah. And what's your answer? I don't know, that was... Hold on, hold on, we're all here. I guess that was the impression you gave me of all. Let's ask Zach himself. Do you hate gay people? Or no, maybe she said... She said it in a nicer way, but she's like, do you think he's...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:43.842 --> 0:53:45.445]: 
  Yeah, here's exactly what happened.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:48.887 --> 0:53:50.946]: 
  Really? She said that to you?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:50.946 --> 0:53:51.705]: 
  a little bit, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:53.680 --> 0:53:55.620]: 
  I guess the- Hold on, we're all here.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:58.455 --> 0:53:59.620]: 
  Do you hate the evil?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:04.429 --> 0:54:09.509]: 
  Just know that I split his name. Let's be honest then. We're all here. I'm just saying, Zach. What do you think, Zach?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:05.087 --> 0:54:07.500]: 
  No, let's be honest with it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:07.500 --> 0:54:14.487]: 
  We're all here. I'm just saying, Zach woke up one morning and he had an epiphany and a lot of questions about himself. That's all I'm saying. Are you okay?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:13.575 --> 0:55:09.432]: 
  You look at it. You know I know he's pinning it on yeah, I'm gonna say yo I said a shit argument you lost the whole year to lose a third time.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:27.842 --> 0:56:18.754]: 
  Fuck you Zach your whole line of questioning all this is I'm making complete sense an act something you do Does not make you gay or straight? Yeah, you're standing in a corner cowering because your initial fucking argument was wrong If you listen to both these pockets, why does the exact same you guys with foot flopping? I learned this bit. I've been flip flopping So consistent, why are you doing this game? Your argument has no sense from fucking Jump Street man My name is because since what? I hope I can fucking put this. I hope I can turn that part up when you say that. I wanted this to be like this. If I was gay then it would be gay. Yeah, not an hour. Yeah, because I'd be gay if I was doing that. No, what did the dude really do when he blew you? Is that gay? Guys. Change the subject Zach, you already lost. Look, we can debate all day. The truth is until you all suck your own dick.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:05.389 --> 0:56:08.055]: 
  Yeah, because I'd be gay if I was doing that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:11.245 --> 0:56:13.911]: 
  Changes the subject, Zach, you're already lost!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:17.927 --> 0:56:23.310]: 
  The truth is, Zack needs to get out of the fucking closet and talk to his mom.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:20.324 --> 0:57:01.127]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:22.497 --> 1:00:23.543]: 
  Il y a le reste de quoi j'ai...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:23.543 --> 1:00:37.499]: 
  Dumb school kids with nukes. Here's a question for all of you guys. You know with the whole advent of total recall and all that, would you take up the opportunity to go to Mars and never return?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:27.846 --> 1:00:28.875]: 
  Yeah, okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:37.499 --> 1:01:22.943]: 
  Now I wouldn't I know Zach would know I think I think that's a really romantic idea But after about a week there it's like a vacation runs a good Hawaii after like a week of Hawaii really go now I think bars would be even that tempo. Well, it's not a vacation now. What would you know? That's right me though So you could Hawaii's fucking amazing when you're gonna like for a week You're like I want to go home bars to be that thousand million you'd be there for like threes like I fucked up dude Yo, that's actually a cartoon series I wanted to make which was about a colony that goes from Earth to Mars And it's like the 30 people that are all trapped together and like they all fucking hate each other cuz like they're just random Ass that fucking sign up for this shit. It's like it's like romantic. It's like I'm gonna die of ours. It's like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:39.878 --> 1:00:40.452]: 
  I would.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:00:39.945 --> 1:00:40.620]: 
  I know.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:15.282 --> 1:01:18.336]: 
  I think it's like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:21.492 --> 1:01:28.444]: 
  It's consistently romantic though, you go there and you're on a brand new planet?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:26.993 --> 1:02:42.323]: 
  Brand new planet you people are the last really huge pieces. How long we live, but still you're wasn't it like what would you miss from earth living in a Rocky desert the entire plan you're living in like a fucking like here's an example like compound the president of the United States Every president of the last of whatever years always complains that they can't have privacy Obama like pisses off the secret service because he goes on walks because he can't be alone. That's the president He's a president. He's a highest. He's the most powerful guy on earth those powerful guy there That's that's it gets a kid just go for a fucking smoke or whatever So I'm always would be like yeah you're a Mars, but you can't just go for a fucking cup of coffee or whatever What's the biggest sure you can't make what you the biggest downside like the fact you can't go outside without a fucking helmet on Okay, I think the big sense is you're on Mars, dude. Nobody's fucking there. I really don't see what the problem is What if you did like I love space I love Mars, but there wouldn't be a lot to do besides work It's a very simple. That's all we do here. It depends what's here, but you go for a breath of air though If you didn't you wouldn't go to the lines and see your food to be very limited Yeah, you can't get rid of laps or whatever. Yeah, but I never fucking changes right But you never change who you hang out with do like yeah, you're stuck in trap in this fucking tubular

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:28.444 --> 1:01:28.545]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:01:31.819 --> 1:01:33.304]: 
  Wasn't it like what would you?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:01:35.717 --> 1:01:38.789]: 
  Yeah. The entire tradition is walking inside of a smoke.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:01:57.284 --> 1:01:58.617]: 
  That's as big as it gets.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:05.890 --> 1:02:06.953]: 
  I'm sure he can't be.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:11.442 --> 1:02:12.657]: 
  I think the big sentence is you're up.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:16.099 --> 1:02:17.939]: 
  What if you didn't like it?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:17.939 --> 1:02:18.563]: 
  NO POSITIVE

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:22.799 --> 1:02:24.773]: 
  That's all we do here!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:32.654 --> 1:02:33.329]: 
  Yeah, but you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:41.614 --> 1:02:45.546]: 
  What the hell are you talking about? I don't change what hang on with now. I mean cycles. Yeah, that's

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:44.939 --> 1:03:36.441]: 
  Yeah, that's right, but you got to choose who you got to hang out at this point It's just people signing up to go to fucking Mars most of those people are fucking either homicidal or they're fucking just the weirdest Awkwardest people who are so distanced from earth to begin with that they'd rather live on a different fucking planet than being with all of us I think they would put those assholes on a ship. I absolutely Cuz those are the only people that would spend the rest of their lives on a planet off of earth You're talking about colonizing another planet. They wouldn't do that How many mentally healthy with like good relationships and all that kind of shit would be like yeah I'm totally good to leave everything off of earth and just move to fucking Mars with like 300 strangers So leave earth and advance mankind. I would say thousands. No, no seriously dude No dude, no dude You have no idea what's going on

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:03.687 --> 1:03:05.880]: 
  You think they would put those assholes on him?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:29.370 --> 1:03:32.205]: 
  Strangers, from the advanced mankind.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:36.441 --> 1:03:40.727]: 
  You have no faith in mankind. This is another argument you're gonna fuckin' lose. What was that?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:39.647 --> 1:03:43.073]: 
  We're so zoomed in city the town's people towards зарmedia

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:42.499 --> 1:03:47.157]: 
  Two thousand people would want to go to Mars. No, there are thousands of people that want to go. Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:44.406 --> 1:04:20.485]: 
  No, there are thousands of people that want to go. Yes. No thousands of good people would want to go Hold on they want to go, but that's not the same as being able to go the actual amount of people that be able to go over I mean we're talking like 20 people 30 people a year If you if you look how much you're talking technical sure no, I'm not gonna agree with that No, no, no, but what Stanford saying is what I disagree with which is I'm really simple But I disagree it would take honestly a century to get like a good couple of dozen thousand people I think that right so let's just say Let's just say everyone could go to Mars. Let's just say there was an open

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:00.235 --> 1:04:02.496]: 
  You're talking technical stuff? Sure, no, I'm not gonna...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:02.496 --> 1:04:03.441]: 
  I disagree with that.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:14.646 --> 1:04:17.076]: 
  Let's just see. Hold on, hold on.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:21.565 --> 1:04:30.593]: 
  Anyway, you can go. I think you're gonna get a hell of a lot more fucking weirdos going to fucking Mars than straight up fucking good people.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:26.290 --> 1:04:27.724]: 
  It's going to fucking Mars.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:29.226 --> 1:04:36.870]: 
  I'm saying there's thousands of good people that could go to Mars and colonize in any perfectly habitable place. I don't disagree with that.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:34.103 --> 1:04:34.896]: 
  Yes!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:04:35.790 --> 1:04:58.217]: 
  I don't disagree with that, but I think that there are so many weird ass fucking people who are just in this world and this life That they are not necessarily people that I want to be it's not a bus They can't just board it. They're not just gonna let anybody they're gonna test you Like you for example you're not going

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:40.178 --> 1:04:42.507]: 
  I think the psychos are worth it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:46.995 --> 1:04:47.502]: 
  It's not a...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:52.092 --> 1:04:55.214]: 
  If you don't know

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:00.597 --> 1:05:47.948]: 
  That's because by the time we showed up there would be no more booze when we got to Mars and they'd be all fucking pissed off. They kill you to death, they dismay for you. I'd be sitting there sucking my own dick and they'd be like, fuck this asshole. The first colonists for the first couple years are gonna be stuck in these tiny little pods. Yeah, pods. Eating like, plants. Let me tell you this. They might be able to read books. I'd go to Mars because I'm a... They forgot how to read on their way to Mars. No, no, no, no, no. I'm saying they get... At most for entertainment they'll be able to download... Oh, alright. Like, data-wise. I say the guy's sending books, but not movies probably. I think they download like the entire internet before they show it up. They'd have millions of hours of fucking bullshit and cats playing piano. Reading Wikipedia. Yeah, that's right. And Wikipedia. They'd have to get a hand on Mars. They wouldn't have to do that. Yeah. You'd have to do... I think they'd do... You kill yourself!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:05.018 --> 1:05:07.245]: 
  They believe it too. They disagree on it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:13.827 --> 1:05:14.080]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:16.071 --> 1:05:16.122]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:05:31.309 --> 1:05:32.912]: 
  the internet too.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:41.114 --> 1:05:43.459]: 
  Yeah, that's right. And Wikipedia.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:47.948 --> 1:05:55.457]: 
  Yeah, well, so here's my options. I colonize another planet or I'd sit and debate about... They......debate about blowing my stuff.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:53.770 --> 1:05:54.782]: 
  They suck at you and my-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:05:56.554 --> 1:06:27.115]: 
  Zach Imagine to move into the middle of fucking Sahara desert and you would you'd never see another HD video in the rest of your life You know shitty food Garbage anyways who cares Not being something it's not a big deal. It is a big deal. I love how you're in the middle And you might have coffee. I like how that's an option though like maybe maybe maybe you have coffee Coffee

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:06.899 --> 1:06:12.130]: 
  I think like garbage anyways who cares

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:23.385 --> 1:06:29.865]: 
  Maybe because another shit in three years of pure coffee will never have another good coffee.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:27.942 --> 1:06:39.383]: 
  We'll never have another big coffee. Institutionalized? No, they threw you like a little fucking titan. Solidary confinement. Yeah, humans crack on your soul dude, confining you with your fucking... Imagine that, but the rest of you like pretty much.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:33.679 --> 1:06:34.995]: 
  Solid very confined

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:34.439 --> 1:06:35.384]: 
  confinement.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:37.493 --> 1:06:38.033]: 
  Xu

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:39.147 --> 1:06:44.395]: 
  They're not sending you to prison, they're sending you to Mars. No, but like this, the house parade would probably be slow.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:41.948 --> 1:06:47.618]: 
  But you can fly. The house for it would probably be smaller than the party people. You guys see like...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:46.892 --> 1:06:50.504]: 
  You guys sit in your apartments all day and animate and this is gonna help. But you're not having a problem.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:48.985 --> 1:07:24.996]: 
  It's about the ability you can't you have the ability to walk us out of every one There's a question How long would each of you think you'd be able to last living in like a solitary environment just by yourself like never seeing another person? I actually have more faith than how long could you last come I think I would do well I you know what I think you can't go to Mars. I could live the rest of my life. Oh, yeah No, absolutely. I think it's I think it's animators like we've conditioned ourselves to be isolated And I do think that like we could be in an isolated Absolutely, we get that we would not go crazy. So with

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:54.199 --> 1:06:55.532]: 
  Here's a question. Can't you just do that?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:01.624 --> 1:07:01.675]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:01.675 --> 1:07:01.962]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:07.412 --> 1:07:11.850]: 
  I could live the rest of my life. Deep off! Yo, yeah! No, absolutely, I think it's...

  I just heard about it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:10.665 --> 1:11:14.159]: 
  Every time I go to the hospital and they tell me to piss or shit in a cup, I can't do it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:14.159 --> 1:11:21.449]: 
  I wouldn't have happened if they put it over the toilet. I guess you're gonna be a nurse. I guess you just gotta get used to shoveling up. No, no, I mean how do you...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:16.302 --> 1:11:16.724]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:20.487 --> 1:11:28.958]: 
  No, no, I mean, how do you do it as a, as the giver? Like say, can you go piss in this cup? And it's like, I don't know, maybe in like three hours.

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:27.490 --> 1:11:47.537]: 
  Maybe in like three hours. I was gonna bring that up. Yeah, like since every, the few times I've had to do that, A, I either couldn't piss and I had to sit around for an hour awkwardly apologizing because I couldn't piss or, or they gave me the cup when I over, you ever overfilled a cup? Yeah. What the heck are you doing? Dude, I'm telling you. The cup and it's like to the top of the brim with piss.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:41.310 --> 1:11:41.952]:

  Dude, I'm telling you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:46.727 --> 1:11:50.001]: 
  I had a one liter fucking bottle and I filled it up

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:50.001 --> 1:12:08.192]: 
  It was fucking good. You had it with your pissing in the cup, you feel like you can't stop. You're so stupid, you're like, oh, I need to stop. You already got it. You know what I mean? It's hard to stop big piss. The first time I did it, I filled it all in. Like, I literally only need like three drops. I know, I'm scared of you. You know what I'm saying? Step next to me, piss. Try to stop big piss. If you have a big piss, like you...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:07.450 --> 1:12:17.254]: 
  You know what they need to do? They need to put sensors in the fucking toilets in the bathrooms that you stay in so you go and piss in the toilet and they just test it through the toilet water that you piss in the end. That is genius.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:16.174 --> 1:12:20.309]: 
  That is genius. That's going to be a piece of cake. You want to store sample? That would be an 87.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:18.064 --> 1:12:57.535]: 
  You want to steal a sample? That would be an $87,000 toilet. They get paid enough. Like you do every whole hundred years. You'll have a big diarrhea. Like, you have cancer. Good day. Zach, what is a piece of technology? Good day. Be well. Be well. Besides the cancer. LOLOL. What is something in the future that, after we're all dead, and there will be some piece of technology, what would something in the future you'd want now that you know you'll never be able to have? But they'll have in the future probably. But you're going to try and do that. Little great grandson of Zach. He's our hero. He's our hero.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:18.942 --> 1:12:20.174]: 
  That would be an 87.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:22.283 --> 1:12:22.857]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:17.093 --> 1:13:21.717]: 
  It'll be a convenience to your everyday life that doesn't exist.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:20.249 --> 1:13:27.994]: 
  cancer machine I just said that you can't see one cancer I would choose that though I would choose you wouldn't choose a

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:25.007 --> 1:13:25.733]: 
  Can't just stand.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:27.994 --> 1:13:42.102]: 
  cancer scan? Most problems are solved with common sense. That's right, when I had cancer, it all needed some good common sense. There's a machine you can put your finger in and it's like, oh, you stop eating sugar and stop smoking cigarettes.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:31.234 --> 1:13:36.651]: 
  That's right, when I had cancer, then all I needed was some good common sense. Oh, like your itching.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:40.937 --> 1:14:11.954]: 
  Yeah, you're saying the cure the right before you get to that. Yeah, why don't you fucking stop doing stupid shit? I really I would love to see the future just for this part I know this is gonna happen eventually but AI is gonna get so good one point at some point in the future Be able to program something that can tell a funniest joke like like compile every single the best joke of all time And a robot you can tell the funniest joke. Do you feel threatened? No, I do people with the threat because what the fuck would happen if like robots can like Program people with the funniest fucking of all time. No, but it

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:43.874 --> 1:13:45.612]: 
  before you get to that.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:11.144 --> 1:14:17.033]: 
  Nobody it nobody can be like you nobody can be like me nobody Can do that and yes it does matter

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:14.670 --> 1:14:27.495]: 
  It doesn't matter. Yes it does, man. You take every amazing best joke at people all the streets laugh. That's not an individual. That's like an amalgamation of fucking everybody. Imagine if like, imagine if a scientist programs that, and it sells the jokes to comedians.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:19.463 --> 1:14:23.209]: 
  That's not an individual, that's like an amalgamation of fucking everybody.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:27.495 --> 1:14:33.992]: 
  It is not possible to manufacture a personality. It's not. Hold on, but Jeff, I have something to say.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:32.659 --> 1:14:36.574]: 
  Jeff, I have something to say about that, but Jeff... I want to test something real quick. Hold on.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:33.992 --> 1:14:36.777]: 
  somebody say about that but yes something wrong

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:37.249 --> 1:14:39.139]: 
  Why did the chicken cross the road?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:39.139 --> 1:14:43.189]: 
  I have no particular insight into the motivations of chickens.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:14:42.565 --> 1:16:15.529]: 
  I have no particular insight into the motivations of chickens. Jeff, alright never mind. No, but I don't even know. That's a perfect example actually. Jeff, I don't even be like, artificial intelligence responding like being witty. I mean like, it's completely unintelligent but they basically make an algorithm. They put every single, the most funny jokes of all time in this computer program and then from there they figure out the funniest jokes. That's not possible. I would say it absolutely is given 100 years. But hold on. You, when you see what is quote unquote popular in terms of comedy, right? I would say there are some objective like basic like timing. Sure, but there is, now I'm just saying of all the things like flying cars, telepagation, you want an AI that can tell funny jokes. No, he doesn't want it. Because I can't, because I think every asshole in this dog is going to say, flying cars against robots and I've just started out the proposal. Sex robots. I think sexual, I don't think flying cars are ever going to be compacted or jet packs. They're so weird and stupid. You know, I want that like in total, in both total we call movies, you can dress up as another person. Yeah, you want a single-hand one? Yeah. Why? Isn't that what's called a feral or whatever? Yeah, it was kind of bland, honestly. Wasn't it the same movie just remade? It was different. They apparently went, they apparently tried to stick more to the book. Don't tell anybody. No, it just didn't have that much personality. It was really kind of... You always do it every time, so at least 13 days. I promise, I won't. Like that movie, like many movies, the art director was nice. Wait, what exactly did he have, did he have leaky balls?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:46.024 --> 1:14:49.990]: 
  They're mine. But I don't hear... That's a perfect example actually.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:15:04.452 --> 1:15:07.725]: 
  That's not possible. I would say it absolutely is given 100 years.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:13.446 --> 1:15:14.560]: 
  I will say that also.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:16.450 --> 1:15:17.007]: 
  be sure.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:15:17.007 --> 1:15:17.412]: 
  Cheers.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:15:21.327 --> 1:15:23.554]:

  He has to go blow himself upstairs to convince him.

He was getting burnt in there, dude. No, but the worst toilet experience I had in China was when we tried to go horseback riding by the Great Wall, and the only place they were doing the horseback riding was by this farm. But essentially, the bathroom that they had was just this shed. So they're like, oh, I need to go to the bathroom. Oh, yeah, yeah, it's right over there. It wasn't an outhouse. It was like this small shed with a big ditch, almost like if you were to look at the end of a pool. Like you're looking into a pool. And it goes to the shallow one. I swear to God, absolutely, my grandfather's grave. I saw a horse's head. I saw half of a fucking cart with the wheels. A decapitated horse's head. I don't know if it was just the head or the whole horse was in there, I couldn't tell. It was just this pit of things. And it included a whole lot of shit and piss, but it had a horse's head, and it had a whole bunch of weird things sticking out of it. And maybe if anyone's traveled to China who's listening to the podcast, who's ever fucking been to China to a farming community, would be like, oh yeah, yeah, that's absolutely. It's okay, of course, the piss is not a horse. But all I remember was I was trying to take fucking piss. Then all of a sudden I saw a horse's head in there. I mean, it was big. I would have saw a child who would have tried to piss the horse's mouth, you know what I mean? No reason.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:15.974 --> 1:19:19.230]: 
  A decapitated horse's head.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:43.362 --> 1:19:45.015]: 
  Absolutely. Yeah, of course. Yeah, of course.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:54.685 --> 1:19:58.195]: 
  No, right. If you're gay, if you put your winger in the horse's mouth.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:56.642 --> 1:20:04.405]: 
  Weiner in the horse's mouth. Only if you think of a gank bucket you have the ass in coming. That would be weird. Jeff, question. Yeah. Do you subscribe to the believe that Jesus.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:05.046 --> 1:20:28.384]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:09.012 --> 1:20:11.172]: 
  I'm being honest, I didn't see that coming.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:27.203 --> 1:20:32.519]: 
  Go to geocities.com.com.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:29.616 --> 1:22:03.981]: 
  Can we talk about you? You're talking about conspiracy theorists? They always found this one piece of information on some geocities webpage and then all of a sudden that just makes it true. Somebody leave me to a thing called theglobalism.com and I say, what the fuck is this? I don't know if it happens in the podcast, but I think it's really funny when conspiracy theorists get conspiracies made about them and they get furious. You know what I'm talking about? Like Alex Jones is a conspiracy that he's actually Bill Hicks who lived on and he gets furious when you say that. There's also conspiracies that Alex Jones is like a CIA agent. Who the fuck is Alex Jones? He's a big fat guy in Texas. It talks like this. This is not a joke. He's a lot of big fat guys. He's like 37 but looks 55. Also Jesse Ventura is one too. He's a huge one. Jesse Ventura. I went with him when he was an actor. He's the most boring people that ever said that. But there's slack jobs back in the room here. There's so many rumors about when he talks like this now. I don't know if it didn't happen the way you thought it did folks. It's all an inside job. Alex, could you please talk about this? You make a better Jesse Ventura than he does. I listen to a lot of these hilarious... It's the folks. I was on every show. Folks, we have big problems in the US government today. You wouldn't believe it. Why isn't anyone taking me seriously? I was a wrestler first and a governor second. And then I was in command. Nobody believes me when I say I saw a Grey Alien. What happens to the real Chaitan? You're like when... If Zach and Jesse Ventura were Dragon Ball Z capping.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:37.412 --> 1:20:38.138]:
