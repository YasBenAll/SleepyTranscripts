  Jeff's face right now.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:53.565 --> 0:05:53.438]:

This is the preface. The hospital is coming. Okay, yeah, alright. This is super interesting preface. This is the build up. There's way more shit tales in this story. Okay, so anyway, so Zach opens the bathroom door slowly, his head creeps out the corner, looks at us, daggerite starts chuckling and then goes, guys, and we're like what? And then we both looked up and then he put up, like he waved it like a flag. You did not. He waved it like a flag, it was like something he was proud of. I held it up, I held it up. You are fucking gross. I held it up like ISIS holding the severed head. Yeah. You give me shit for being gross. Let me tell you. You fucking little hypocrite. Let me tell you. You're gross, you're nasty. I can be gross, right? But that is fucking disgusting. That is gross. I was gonna throw it away anyways. It's like wafting through the air. No, no, no, no. What am I gonna do with this?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:04.440 --> 0:06:07.950]: 
  I did not do that

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:07.579 --> 0:06:17.873]:

So Zach, you had, you, you're, they come out like blocks of tar. Your shit was coming out. It was literal tome. And you were worried, and you didn't know what to do.

Zack knows what part of him I'm saying. No, this is the other part of the story. I did not, I did not not want to go. How many acts are there to the story? It's a 10 act movie. Well, no, no. I did not, I wanted to go to the doctor. This is like a Shakespearean shit. I, Zack. Let's not bicker. Zack. Okay, look. It was reasonable that you didn't want to go to the hospital.

  I wanted to go to the hospital, then you convinced me out of it. You said, oh you're fine, man. You said you're fine, you're fine. I looked it up. Black shit means a bleeding on the inside. I thought no good. Yeah, that was, yeah. No good. That means you're bleeding way up in your intestines. Yeah, yeah, in my stomach or my small intestines. It's not like I ripped a sphincter. No, no, no, but I was like, I don't want this happening. Because it happened for two more days. I thought bad. Oh, god. I came to the office. I was laying on the couch. I was really sick. I was like, oh, it was very, very, very hot beans.

  You're potentially blaming Nile if you were to be dead. No, no, I wasn't blaming Nile, but Nile, if you had to kill Zach, I would have been really upset. No, you weren't talking me out of it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:36.720 --> 0:08:37.496]:

Not going to the doctor unless that, did that clip? No. I was brought up not going to the doctor unless I was dying. I was bleeding on the inside. It's never happened before. Yeah, okay, oh, yeah. Okay, you're okay. You know insurance families are up there. Wait, listen, first of all, Zach didn't get the medicines the doctor prescribed and now he's okay. And now he has to pay thousands of dollars for a CAT scan. Yeah. So I was fucking right, man. Yeah, okay, okay, okay. And maybe you could stop picking your hole all the time. Okay, so I should have.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:48.516 --> 0:08:49.444]:

Well, I have we'll get to that But I couldn't find the fucking main entrance all these arrows keep pointing to you know He says a mer all these signs a emergency and then an arrow in a direction and then all of a sudden it takes you a circle They stopped they stopped by going somewhere and I'm like where where we going Yeah, and I was driving around the outside of the hospital like three times trying to look for the main and main entrance when in reality It's kind of in the center of the complex You kind of think snake through all these roads into the middle of it to find the main entrance So I dropped deck off at one of the exterior entrances, and I

 SPEAKER_03 [0:11:29.436 --> 0:11:29.504]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:45.602 --> 0:11:52.875]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:51.424 --> 0:11:55.980]: 
  I was slightly panicking. I didn't know how I didn't know Zach. I did actually

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:54.158 --> 0:12:02.444]: 
  I didn't know Zach was just gonna drop that. I did, I actually felt like I was like, I felt like a ghost and it was weird because in one of the hallways there was this huge flat screen TV that was really well lit.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:02.444 --> 0:12:03.945]: 
  Nobody was at the hospital at all. Cool.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:03.945 --> 0:12:17.007]: 
  There was one huge flat screen. It was like a doctor like here at Abington Hospital We have it felt it felt like a weird like Robocop moment was like a future tech It was weird. It was bizarre. I thought I was like, I might die. What the hell's happening? So I stumbled

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:10.982 --> 0:12:11.742]: 
  Would you take?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:17.007 --> 0:12:26.946]: 
  through all these like million corridors and saw people like dead on the floor. I find my way to this one lady at the very end of the emergency room. Only one should check at the door.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:26.035 --> 0:12:26.389]: 
  Hmm.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:26.946 --> 0:12:44.496]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:45.576 --> 0:12:49.322]: 
  And while this was happening, I was like, Jeff was trying to find the spot.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:48.985 --> 0:13:53.498]: 
  I found a parking space. I wandered into the hospital through the same entrance I left a Zac at and I'm like, I can probably find him and I wandered around for a while. There was, it was like a fucking goat. It was like a horror movie. There was nobody around. It was 11 30 at night in the hospital. That's good though. I couldn't find anybody. I was wandering up and down hallways. I saw maybe one nurse. It's what I wanted to do. I couldn't find you. I couldn't find the emergency room. I went back to a main desk. I saw just a lone phone sitting down the desk and it says call for assistance. And I feel like I was in the movie, like the shining or something. And I'm just like, and I'm just like alone in this huge foyer. And I'm like, I pick up the phone. I'm like, hello? It's like, this woman's like, how may I help you, sir? And I'm like, I'm looking for a Zac. And he's, she's like, well, what, you know, what's his, she's like, well, uh, uh, she's like, well, where are you? And I'm like, oh, I'm at this so-and-so entrance. And she's like, oh, so the doors weren't locked. No, no, they weren't. I'm standing. Yeah, you wanted it to a closed hospital. No, no, but the entrance he walked in should-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:02.637 --> 0:13:03.396]:

  to be closed. One of the doors I walked into had a huge red banner cross that said, after nine o'clock, then you cannot walk through here. I walked through there and nobody did anything.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:03.083 --> 0:14:20.802]: 
  There's no classic places, but anyways she said she couldn't she said she's like well I can't she's like she's like well. I'm not there. I'm she's looking at another fucking state She's not even in the hospital this woman. I'm talking to on the fucking phone So she's like I can't help you you just gonna have to find the emergency room and maybe they can they can help you locate them I'm like all right. Well, thank you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:21.190 --> 0:14:43.752]: 
  And as that's happening, I go back to my room, the doctor walks in, and he's like, ah, so what's the problem? You know, they had a ton of people asking the same thing, and you got to describe it over and over. And so I did, and then a nurse came in. And, uh, well actually, the doctor, for fun of that, the doctor was like, he was like, lean over to your side, and I was like, why? He was like, you know, you have to do the, uh, picking up the ass. And I was like, I'm certainly laughing. And I was joking. Oh, God.

Strapping yourself to McDonald's. Strapping it on. I said one day that I wanted to not go to school, so I pretended I had a stomach ache as kids do. And then my mom brought me to the doctor because I was really playing it up this time. Oh. Because she didn't believe me at first. And the doctor put pressure on my lower stomach and he was like, Does this feel... does this hurt? And I was like, yeah. And then he goes, yeah, it's appendicitis. I was like, what? He goes, yeah, you have to get that appendicitis. I was like...

Oh, I told him, they gave me a huge fucking bottle, and I only took like, two or three of them out of, like, fifty. I couldn't even believe how many they fucking gave me, so... He said, in the meantime, alright, we're gonna do this thing where, uh......

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:54.274 --> 0:31:54.949]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:07.875 --> 0:32:34.555]: 
  Um, oh yeah, first I went to another doctor and this is the funny thing about fucking doctors. He said, okay, well, you do have a kidney stone, here are your options. And he listed through like a bunch of options. He's like, okay, first we can put a stent in, which is basically putting a tube up your dick and hoping the thing comes out on its own and just assist the stone coming out. Or we can do this, or we can do this. Or, you know, we can...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:35.348 --> 0:33:17.586]: 
  I forget what the other options were but none of them were particularly pleasing and I said well Well, doctor, what do you suggest? And he basically like Let me just go through the options again, and he listed to the options again, and I said well That's great. No, but what do you see what you're the doctor? What do you what do you? What do you suggest me to do? And he wouldn't fucking tell me he's like well Let me just read through the options again, and you know you you should pick one And I'm like I know it was certain to occur to me like I was just being a naive or something that you know he He was afraid to give me a suggestion I don't know if this doctor has been sued before This is just typical with all doctors, but he didn't want to fucking give me a suggestion for what to do, so

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:17.265 --> 0:33:17.535]: 
  Hmm

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:18.869 --> 0:33:51.910]:

You have a little leaf over your dick.

And the next thing you know So you know he- First he scans my- There's just like a live- There's like a live window of what he can see in my stomach. You know what's funny? When you're lying like down in water and you've got like no boner, your dick like floats so it- It's like- I was lying on my back. Like a buoyancy thing? It just makes it look like you have a little baby dick. So first thing the guy says is like Yeah, you have a lot of gas in you. I'm like, oh thanks. You're Putin? Yeah, no I wasn't it just I guess it was all like a pressure buildup So they were having trouble locating the kidney stone. Yeah. So- They just looked the parts out of you.

I'm sitting there in pain and it was biology And I was like sir. I got a pain in my nut and everyone's like I was like no, I'm serious. He was like, you know well It was named a part of your ball and I'll let you go and I was like yeah My happy diddha and he was like okay off you go. I never was like ha ha ha Okay, so I go to the hospital with my mom I have to wait with it I'm holding my balls next to my mom and then she brings me into a room The nurse takes a look at my balls and she's like I can't handle these big boys have to go get my superior So she brings in a she brings in a little brown man, and he's like I will hold your balls And he held both my balls for both of his little hands And he's like you have twisted your balls if you have it if you hadn't have left it any longer We would have had to amputate one of them and I was like that's shit So he fucking grabs both my balls right he stretches them out as far as it can with both hands And he fucking throws them in opposite directions. They spin around for a few minutes. That's what you happen Yeah, no like they spun around for like a few minutes, and then they were back to normal

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:34.988 --> 0:38:35.714]: 
  Oh, God.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:43.274 --> 0:38:44.084]: 
  That actually happened.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:46.733 --> 0:38:56.520]: 
  they're so they're just you Chris originally I but my cousin had that but he said when he pulled the balls apart the guy stuck his face in it like with those like silly putting on like it's our wars with this face stuck

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:54.765 --> 0:39:06.983]: 
  Like in Star Wars with the Chris Worshp. His face stuck in the ball skin. He didn't do that to me. He actually... With the carbonite, you know what I'm saying? He spun the balls around and then he grabbed the flaps of the ball sack and he stretched it out like bat wings and then he put his lips up to the wind.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:07.439 --> 0:39:09.784]: 
  He said you will be normal!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:39:09.784 --> 0:40:39.542]: 
  He was like, you are free of all demons. And I was like, thank you. You are truly not a hook no-zareble, exact would say. And he finished into the wall. He bolted into the floor. He faded away into sand, into wind. You can't say how it comes out. That's the story of my balls. I can back up for a minute. I'll just tell you one little detail I left out. Before I went in for the procedure, they stuck a needle in my arm for the IV. The IV. And this stupid nurse missed. So if anybody was ever wondering what happens if you don't get an IV in your vein, if they missed the vein, she put it in my arm and she walked out. All of a sudden, my arm starts blowing up. Like my forearm is blowing up like a balloon. Oh, God. It's filling up in my arm. Gross. But I understand. I'm like, this is not happening. This is not normal. Did you pull it out? No, because yeah, they tape it on. Like the arm. Yeah, yeah. And then I'm like, I'm so freaked out by needles. I'm like, oh my God, I can't pull this out of my arm. And I'm just like, ah! I'm just like, ah! Ah! She comes back in and she's like, oh, sorry about that. Did she drain it all out? And the body absorbs it. It takes a minute to put it. That's even that, dude. But it takes a minute to absorb back into your body. But yeah, if it doesn't get in the vein, it just, what were they pumping into you? Just saline, whatever. Saline is just like salt water. Yeah, just for some reason, they're like hydrating you before they do anything. It takes like electrolytes and all that bullshit. I'm going to put my toe in salt water and remove the infection.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:12.569 --> 0:39:14.037]: 
  And I was like, thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:13.935 --> 0:39:13.986]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:23.301 --> 0:39:24.735]: 
  You can't say what comes out.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:39:30.439 --> 0:39:30.895]: 
  No.

  the newspaper like the newspaper headline oh yeah of your death we talked about this before did we I don't know well I don't know if I mentioned before but my whole my whole plan is basically to set up a rude gold-during machine where I

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:30.707 --> 0:41:33.239]: 
  We do talk about the pilot you can go over to get though

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:32.277 --> 0:41:52.645]: 
  I was just bringing up again. I set up a Rood Goldberg machine where you put a canvas on the wall And I basically stand up against the canvas and I just shoot myself in the head No, no, no, this is what happens basically everything's tied to like the gun in the canvas and it blows my brains out against the canvas That's hilarious. And then it

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:41.609 --> 0:41:42.503]: 
  I'm gonna shut up in there.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:42.503 --> 0:41]: 
  You don't use the root gobermachines?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:53.455 --> 0:42:09.739]: 
  And then the machine starts going off and it dumps my butt, like a trap door opens in the floor, dumps my body in like a garbage can or something. And then some little machine, it goes around the room like dropping metal balls through hoops and stuff and it comes around and then a little metal arm will like sign my name on the bottom of the canvas.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:11.123 --> 0:42:14.009]:

  I don't know how much I would kill you. Uh... I'd go into the desert with a... a tripod and I'd tape a magnifying glass to it and I'd lie under it and let it burn a hole in my head and kill me.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:16.506 --> 0:42:17.940]: 
  How would you want to die?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:27.795 --> 0:42:40.823]:

They dissolve into the ground. Really? And they can go more. They could get into the soil. You ever seen that movie, the sixth today? That movie's stunk. No. What if you were on it and you found out you were the clone? What if you had a clone, but then you found out you were the clone? Yeah, that's exactly the question. Because you could be, because it's exactly that. Speaking of that movie, you can actually clone pets now. But in that movie, yeah, if I was the clone, I'd be like, fuck this. So just leave, and then he could deal with my problems. And I could get him in trouble. Yeah. Of course. Go ahead. Why would you clone your pet though? Because it's going to be a different dog. It looks identical. It's the same. Well, if you're a little kid and I guess you can't deal with dying, I guess they just wouldn't. Yeah, but why would you teach that to kids? It looks like it looks like it. Oh, that'd make you feel better. It looks, yeah, but you can just get another little dog. The most fucked up part of that movie was when I think, what happened? He decided not to clone the dog or something, but he ended up getting a doll instead. And the doll was the creepiest shit. Oh, you remember that, yeah. It was like the doll from Child's Play. Chucky. Chucky. It was like a Chucky doll. Like no kid would want this. Yeah. Get out of here. I didn't like that movie. Dolly the sheep was the first clone. I read that on a toilet book. What the hell is a toilet book? Oh, me, me, me. I had all the toilet books. The toilet books are the books that you put beside the toilet. And you make fun facts. You sit on the toilet. You're like, I'm going to have a big old shit now. I'm going to read for 10 minutes. Dolly the sheep was a clone. And you have books like, how much food does an elephant do? How much food does an elephant do? Do you think books that are used as toilet books, do you think they should ever leave the bathroom? No, it's not a piss. No, because they're covered in feces. Yeah, they are. They're actually like. Me and Chris lived in Ireland. We had a couple and they were like, yeah, those are just piss. I had Watchmen. You remember Watchmen? Yeah.

No. It's a game where you're supposed to like reenact it and you're the sniper and you're supposed to do it the exact same way and you get points for doing it. But yeah, it's like it's weird. It's kind of bad taste. Yeah, it is very bad taste. It's like they call a bite, spike your game. I played it. I actually like, there was a point in college where I played it like after school for like a week every day. Call a bite game? No, no, no. JFK. I was like, I eventually got it all right. And I was like, okay, that's done. Now you can do that real life. No. Now I know how to really be Lee Harvey Oz world. No, but there was like an kind of an addicting factor to the game because like... Why did you kill the president? No, it's because it's like, well, you're learning about how it happened and like you're being rewarded for doing it like perfectly. And there was like really funny ragdoll physics. And if you did it wrong, everyone in the game freaks out and like ragdolls over each other. Shit. It was kind of funny, but yeah, it wouldn't be very funny if it happened to me. Well, you'd be dead. I'm pretty upset.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:34.547 --> 0:58:34.969]:

  아하

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:11.354 --> 1:06:17.445]: 
  But you were more afraid that she was, you were less afraid that she was able to shoo you and more afraid for some reason once you had the urge,

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:17.445 --> 1:06:22.390]: 
  You would snap and kill her because you could. No, I wouldn't kill her. I wouldn't do it, but I just thought like, what if I do...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:22.373 --> 1:06:24.364]: 
  What if you happen to kill her?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:24.364 --> 1:06:28.026]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:29.393 --> 1:06:39.653]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:39.653 --> 1:06:44.445]:

  Cześć!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:44.445 --> 1:06:51.989]: 
  I'm gonna piss me off. It's because I can use my fucking phone. You look homeless though. But I always look homeless, that's my thing. I love gloves, it's like a crash bandicoot. I know.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:51.989 --> 1:06:53.912]: 
  Who has the crash component-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:53.777 --> 1:07:40.740]: 
  I wanna say, your jacket, it's like stylish yet homeless at the same time. I know, that's the look I go for. You know, it's actually the combination of all your clothes. I know. It's very grayish brownish all over. Yeah. And you got the fingerless gloves, you got the beanie hat, you got the open shirt with your little chest hairs hanging out. You do, you pull off the stylish homeless look. That's better than any good guy. You're a fancy homeless guy. That's what I go for. You'd be the fanciest guy at the homeless ball if you were there. You would. And speaking of homeless, does anyone have a light for this? Anyone have a light for this? That completes the picture, the little cigar. Yeah. What do you call those things? Black and Miles. Yeah, I'm trying to quit the cigarette, so I'm smoking on the black and miles. Yeah, maybe you should have started dumbass. I just feel like those things have the little mouthpiece, like the little flute you get in school. Yeah, you can, they whistle.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:59.464 --> 1:06:59.650]: 
  I know

 SPEAKER_03 [1:06:59.650 --> 1:07:00.173]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:16.002 --> 1:07:16.947]: 
  So I go

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:16.947 --> 1:07:17.419]: 
  Go for it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:18.938 --> 1:07:19.005]: 
  MBC 뉴스 이준범입니다.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:27.713 --> 1:07:29.316]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:27.730 --> 1:07:27.949]:

  you

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:35.492 --> 1:07:36.657]: 
  I just feel like those things have-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:07:41.382 --> 1:10:02.845]: 
  Here, I wasn't here last week. Can we talk about how gay soccer is again? Oh no, oh yeah, so Chris went back to Ireland last weekend. I had to watch my dad watch like four soccer matches and all I could think about was how many people die each year over the supporting different teams. That's like people actually kill each other over that. Well yeah, but it, yeah, there's hooligans and all that shit. And I was like, dad, why do people like, why do you care so much about it? It's like, it's about being a part of something. But why can't you be a part of something that's not fucking shitty? Well, they like it. That's what we're seeing. It's like modern day. I know, but you know why I think they like it though? What? It's because it's really relatable. It's when you're a young little boy, you kick a ball around and then you see these guys, you're like, oh, that takes skill. And that's the only reason. People just want something to talk about to other people. And that's, I know, but it's like your 2015 almost. It is your 2015. But also last week, we had a point where it was like, it's like modern day gladiator fights, you know, except people just don't die. But football is boring. Yeah, it's boring. Yeah, it is. I agree. Roby's kind of fun to watch, though. Roby's way more fun to watch because people get the fucking heads kicked off. Hockey's more fun to watch. Basketball is more fun to watch. But football is soccer. It's like it's like that. The only reason they like stuck to it was because, oh, yeah, when I was a little boy, I kicked it and I remember that and that was kind of hard. Yeah, possibly. I get that. It does take skill. But the fact that there's billions of dollars put into it and billions of people are fucking obsessed with it. It's fucking just a sign of the year. The end. The end. Yeah, let that steam out. I can tell you a soccer story. You gotta go for it. When I was in school, when I was a little lad, I was going to do after school soccer. And I went to the store and my mom was like, we have to buy shin guards. Oh, yeah. And I picked out, instead of the white shin guards, like everybody picked out, I bought because I was kind of like into tennis a little bit at the same time, too. Yeah. So I picked out these these shin guards that were like yellow tennis felt or like highlighter. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So like and then I got home and I'm like, oh my God, these are fucking fruity as shit. I'm not wearing these. I'm not even going to play soccer, mom. Fuck you. Oh, so I didn't I ended up dropping out of soccer and then my friend was like, yeah, all right, well, I'll buy him off you. And I did. And he did. And he ended up playing with them and he got beat up. No, he didn't get beat up. He got like severely picked on the whole season for wearing them. I.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:07:48.554 --> 1:07:49.650]: 
 Thank you guys all for watching the hosted 4 soccer match.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:00.771 --> 1:08:01.024]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:35.212 --> 1:08:35.448]:

  you

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:36.486 --> 1:09:38.038]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:42.578 --> 1:09:43.675]: 
  Shit, I'm not wearing these.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:00.786 --> 1:10:18.032]: 
  I had a Jewish friend who was a stalker. He was called the white man of the employment Like look for the only employment. He was very Jewish. Yeah, no, they were brothers actually if you could believe that of course they were. Well, you used to go to Sacrafact this every day

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:08.852 --> 1:10:12.194]: 
  Because he did his own thing earlier. He was pretty Jewish. On his own to a table.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:17.442 --> 1:10:19.602]: 
  What would be the difference surnames if they were both?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:19.298 --> 1:10:34.604]: 
  I was short of about that. But anyways, he goes to soccer practice and he was like, I brought a different board, has a nice Jewish star on it so I can celebrate my Jewishness all day. And they beat him. And there's one other kid called Natsimik Fatsi. He was a Nazi, if you could believe that. Natsimik Fatsi. Natsimik Fatsi.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:28.917 --> 1:10:29.339]: 
  E ele bursts.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:33.119 --> 1:10:36.004]: 
  Nazi McFonsie

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:36.004 --> 1:10:56.946]: 
  No, he was really muscular, he was an Aryan, he was an Aryan Bella, he fucking gouged the eyes out of the Jewish guy and put them all over his own eyes and said, now I see what you see and the world looks even worse because now I see what it's like to be a Jew. Holy shit. I thought you were gonna say it. I was horrible, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I thought he was gonna say it, now I see what you see. Boy's will be boy's.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:38.350 --> 1:10:39.717]: 
  That's an annoying.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:51.141 --> 1:10:51.614]: 
  Até a próxima!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:54.229 --> 1:11:38.982]: 
  I just like typical kid stuff though. Boys with boys. Boys with boys. But um, I got a soccer story, kinda. You know what it means? Nali's living a flat that overlooks Wakesport Towns, so every Saturday night we saw everyone coming home from the nightclubs. And one night there was, there was that big fucking idiot who was like, I support Liverpool and he had a Liverpool tattoo on his arm and he was with this like pretty hot girl. And she was like, can we go home? He's like, no. We're waiting here for a bit. And he was waiting for people to come down to town so he could be like, Oh, how do you support? And it was like, Liverpool. He was like, oh, okay. And then they walked by and then one guy was like, Manchester, you fucking idiot. And he was like, ooh, and they started fighting each other just because it's the two different teams that they supported. I nearly got beaten up in Wakesport because I accidentally kicked the water bottle that they conveniently placed in my pad. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:06.075 --> 1:11:06.261]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:14.462]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:32.316 --> 1:11:33.615]: 
  I nearly got beaten up in Wexford

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:40.332 --> 1:13:17.802]: 
  Yeah, people put water bottles in the street. If you kick it, they chase you and kill you. Yeah, so I was walking to Chris, Chris warned me never to go to Aber Kababra, which is a Kabab shop. That's not the real name. Someone got like, Stabber's the real name. That is not the real name. It is Aber Kababra. That's the real name, man. It's a big friendship. Yeah, but Kabab, Kababs are like tacos. Yeah, they're like tacos in Ireland. And it's like Aber Kababra. Speak language of the gods. Yeah, so I went there. On Aber Kababra. I didn't listen to Chris's advice. And when I was coming home, there was like a group of... Hooligans. Yeah. And then I walked by, I was walking and I kicked and then they go, Oi, you kicked my bottle. And I don't know why they talk like that, but I then they started running after me. And then I ran into this place called Burger Mac, which is a McDonald's ripoff. And I waited in there until they left, but I almost got my head like smashed in for kicking a water ball. It seems like in your country, or even England, people chase each other a lot. No, I chase. Here, the conflicts are quick and like the fighters stab each other, but there they just chase each other around the city. People go out of their way to like try and beat you up, right? Because I was in Uncle Sam's during Christmas getting some chips. And I was like, hey, can I have two battered sausages, please? And then everyone looks at me because I don't sound Irish anymore kind of. And there was an actual small traveler kid, which he's a gypsy pretty much. They're looking the cause, trouble constantly. Because you know movie snatch, it's so... He heard my like slightly American accent. He's like, where are you from? And I was like, Waxford, and I walked away and I was fucking shitting my pants. Because if those little guys stare at on you, there's nothing you can do.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:43.994 --> 1:11:44.567]: 
  So I

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:49.984 --> 1:11:52.937]: 
  It's not through the... People, someone got like stabbed or something. Oh no.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:52.937 --> 1:11:53.005]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:53.005 --> 1:11:56.987]: 
  That is not the real name. It is. That's the real name, man. It's a big friendship.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:58.725 --> 1:12:00.109]: 
  Cababs.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:01.949 --> 1:12:01.999]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:01.999 --> 1:12:04.159]:

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:21.936 --> 1:13:29.007]: 
  Yes, Zach was getting fucking picked on by an Irish traveler. But he wasn't though, he was. Irish travelers will fucking kill you and not think about it. But he wasn't like...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:29.007 --> 1:13:35.942]: 
  like I didn't know he was acting like a casual cause Americans are good people, they're nice. Like if you're on the side of the street here, so we're gonna go to the next one.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:39.739 --> 1:13:50.995]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:45.848 --> 1:13:46.219]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:50.995 --> 1:14:28.103]: 
  They're like, dude, who talked to this guy? So I was like, why? Because they'll fucking, it's discrimination to be like, oh, don't talk to them. But you pretty much shouldn't. Yeah, like the colloquial term. They'll fucking kill you. The colloquial term for them is knackers. And once I was with my friends, a group of them came over and they go, I hate knackers. Do you hate knackers? They're trying to use reverse, trying to get us to go, yeah, we hate knackers. But it was so obvious that that's what they were. So I was like, no, no, I love them. And then they go, ah! Our house has been broken into, by travelers, like at least three times.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:01.154 --> 1:14:03.263]: 
  Yeah, like the colloquial term.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:04.174 --> 1:14:04.545]:

  It was banned for a whole week. But did they realize the marketing potential? I always feel like it was fine.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:28.472 --> 1:16:28.945]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:28.945 --> 1:16:30.801]: 
  I can't realize the marketing potential.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:30.008 --> 1:16:30.447]: 
  I feel like it was...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:31.881 --> 1:16:37.652]: 
  It was a marketing play they really did back out because they didn't want it They got threats basically

 SPEAKER_03 [1:16:37.298 --> 1:16:39.610]: 
  Yeah, but they did realize the marketing potential.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:39.171 --> 1:16:43.947]: 
  It was a lot of the movie theaters too. The movie theaters said we're not gonna show this.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:43.947 --> 1:16:56.215]: 
  I have a question. They released the ending of the movie on... That was leaked! Who was? Yeah, who did that? I didn't think the whole... It's like nobody had the full movie, then all of a sudden somebody released the ending. Well, someone hacked Sony, so...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:48.655 --> 1:16:49.229]: 
  That was leaked.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:16:56.164 --> 1:16:59.843]: 
  I think somebody, whoever, I think whoever hacked Sony to begin with, did I think?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:16:59.843 --> 1:17:18.524]: 
  But if it was the Koreans, why would they do why would they release I have no idea I'm someone yeah, there was a thing that said That it had to have been from inside Sony's building because there's no way you can just hack a network like that Yeah, but Sony's always getting hacked like PSN is always down the actual movie itself. Yeah, I was fucking okay. That's about it

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:02.712 --> 1:17:03.437]: 
  I have no idea.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:14.879 --> 1:17:14.895]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:15.992 --> 1:17:16.515]: 
  Ja, het was...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:18.321 --> 1:17:27.501]: 
  I mean, I wish we got a few good laughs. I think the biggest thing to point out is James Franco is so over the top and stupid ignorant. His character is hilarious sometimes.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:25.409 --> 1:17:26.792]: 
  His character is hilarious.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:27.501 --> 1:17:30.167]: 
  His character is always on 10.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:30.167 --> 1:17:36.951]: 
  So when he's funny he really hits the wrong ball, but when he's not funny it just f**ks up. It just feels, it's palpably uncomfortable. It's so funny.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:36.057 --> 1:17:40.883]: 
  So forced sometimes badly written the whole movie was badly written

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:41.035 --> 1:17:49.270]: 
  I would say there are some very convenient parts and parts that have dead ends. The two poison strips go nowhere. That doesn't go anywhere.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:47.684 --> 1:17:55.446]: 
  go nowhere that doesn't go anywhere they could have taken out the entire rice and part of the movie pretty much the poison strip the poison strips yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:52.560 --> 1:17:53.455]: 
  Vine.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:17:55.446 --> 1:18:03.799]: 
  was there were that was to I think that was kind of a red herring to trick you like I said to verge it was it was it was oh no that way how are they gonna do it definitely yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:59.783 --> 1:18:01.589]: 
  It was, it was.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:02.854 --> 1:18:07.444]: 
  Definitely, yeah, but the two ships come anyways and in those go in

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:07.090 --> 1:18:08.845]: 
  And it's like it just really dead ends

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:08.845 --> 1:18:15.392]: 
  What Jeff said though was the most important thing though, it's like, when they just write someone to be impossibly stupid, it's just lazy.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:15.392 --> 1:18]: 
  it was

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18 --> 1:18:28.454]: 
  funny a couple times he has one line where he's like oh it's 2014 women are smart now that's it that's funny that's so angry that's why you never that terribly was that you deliver that like horribly podium

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:21.450 --> 1:18:23.678]: 
  Yeah, that was funny. That's so ignorant, it's funny.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:26.969 --> 1:18:34.748]: 
  I'm probably it. There's another part where he said, Koichi, why in North Korea? But they don't like his ignorance was funny sometimes. Like it definitely landed sometimes.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:18:34.799 --> 1:18:59.436]: 
  I'm just I don't know when you know in there and FBI headquarters, and she's like we need to take him out To dinner. Yeah, there are a couple parts like that one. Yeah that character, that's the male character The only part where they're like uses bag and he's like no I want my bag. It's like fuck you She was so horribly written that character. I'll give you something with my hands Yeah, let's like go outside your hotel window and there's like no like it's felt really yeah badly written. It felt convenient

 SPEAKER_00 [1:18:41.937 --> 1:18:42.325]: 
  Ya dök

 SPEAKER_00 [1:18:43.574 --> 1:18:43.995]: 
  Stop it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:18:43.995 --> 1:18:45.936]: 
  Yeah that character that's the male character

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:59.065 --> 1:19:06.557]: 
  convenient in the wrong kind of ways but I think yeah that's you a chick character was

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:05.427 --> 1:19:08.329]: 
  I don't even know how to write like girl characters like it's a little bit

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:07.755 --> 1:19:12.750]: 
  No, but they wrote the Asian love it. She was totally... She was really funny. Very good answer.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:09.797 --> 1:19:13.746]: 
  She was great. She was great. She was very funny. Very good after. She was very funny.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:13.493 --> 1:19:17.442]: 
  But the C.I.A. trick was too... I think what they needed was a leader straight man.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:17.205 --> 1:19:20.445]: 
  Yeah, she was literally just serving a purchase.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:19.889 --> 1:19:22.960]: 
  They need like a stone face kind of person to be like

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:22.437 --> 1:19:27.955]: 
  I know bullshit kind of person. She's the hard ass who's so the Meltz for James. She was the hard ass.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:27.044 --> 1:19:40.139]: 
  She wasn't a hard-ass though, she was goofy. She was like a goofy kind of character. Like that black sidekick guy she had, well he was funny because he was so stone-faced all the time. They needed a character like that in her position.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:29.507 --> 1:19:29.946]: 
  She was like...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:38.130 --> 1:19:38.502]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:38.147 --> 1:19:38.451]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:41.286 --> 1:19:49.504]: 
  So yeah, I don't know, I thought the guy who played Kim Jogun was funny, very likable character. He was a cool actor too.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:46.095 --> 1:19:46.399]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:48.053 --> 1:20:31.472]: 
  He was a cool actor. He he he acted the part. Well, he just didn't really look like Yeah, I was saying they should have gotten side of do it like that gang He's got some ugly disgusting little monster He didn't look anything like a you look handsome. He just had like this beautiful smile. Yeah. Yeah. Kim Jong has these really long disgusting teeth Yeah, like like fish teeth, I thought the fucking Katy Perry references were stupid, too I thought it was fine. It was fine. It's just so quirky and fun It played you the fact that he was a fruity faggot I'm kind of sick of those Seth Rogen movies where it's like we'll put in gang style we'll put in like just these would see

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:52.845 --> 1:19:54.381]: 
  No, that was a problem, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:57.452 --> 1:19:57.469]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:59.427 --> 1:20:04.793]: 
  That the Korean He didn't look anything like him. Yeah, he looked handsome

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:09.670 --> 1:20:10.952]: 
  It was.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:10.952 --> 1:20:12.707]: 
  He's like, he's a good beauty.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:14.310 --> 1:20:15.188]: 
  Who knows?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:29.987 --> 1:20:35.826]: 
  But see, I just read that song. No, but that song is like four years old, so it's past, it's been so long that it's not popular anymore.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:35.826 --> 1:20:37.716]: 
  No, it's not.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:37.716 --> 1:20:40.450]: 
  It's not a fresh out the press meme though, it's kind of old-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:40.450 --> 1:21:08.243]: 
  song no but like they didn't like this is the end to it like gang of style and fucking back this is the end this is the end I faulted dude backstreet boys I know I know but it was still like yeah but what if I don't like the backstreet boys now this whole ending is ruined for me that ending was shit anyway and props props to Rogan for this is the name against the throat again seems like showing the audience again he's never worked out a day in his entire life but who cares

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:44.382 --> 1:20:46.002]: 
  This is the end. This is the end.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:52.988 --> 1:20:54.034]: 
  Handing with shit anyway.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:58.439 --> 1:20:59.670]: 
  These all Neo Football teams he known for a while.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:59.670 --> 1:21:01.004]: 
  Showing you. He's like,

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:06.184 --> 1:21:06.690]: 
  Yeah, but I

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:08.007 --> 1:21:12.563]: 
  I did think the Dead Sea was really sweet. Yeah, it was sweet. That was really well put together. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:10.184 --> 1:21:15.584]: 
  Those really will put together. Yeah, Zach was saying was supposed to be even more gory, but uh, yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:15.229 --> 1:21:30.923]: 
  Yeah, they had leaked emails too, where Seth Rogen was like, yeah, we took, we took, we made the hair melting less bad, we made his face, embers less bad, we made his face, his face melt less. Wow. Because apparently it was too, you know, Sony was like, hey, stop that. Hey, come on now. Stop.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:21:25.135 --> 1:21:25.557]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:28.442 --> 1:21:38.500]: 
  Stop it. Come on now. Stop it. Come on now. Stop it kids. Yeah, but I just wish it was kind of slightly more grounded in reality. My biggest issue was like this

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:29.489 --> 1:21:29.944]: 
  I know.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:32.661 --> 1:21:33.623]: 
  Yeah, but uh

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:38.500 --> 1:22:04.217]: 
  This is probably from a kind of a donkey-faggy position, but the whole nuclear thing was kind of far-fetched. The ending is like, Kim Jong-un is going to launch the nukes because James Franco pissed them off. It's like, what? I think it would have created a better sense of urgency if they're going to go that way, where it's like Seth Rogen and James Franco have to save the world from nukes. It would have been better if maybe Kim Jong-un was planning to invade South Korea or something. You know? Like, there was a-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:03.424 --> 1:22:10.495]: 
  America isn't just gonna look at these fucking Koreans with their nukes sitting outside and do nothing. Yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:09.179 --> 1:22:29.175]: 
  Yeah, yeah, but it was like yeah, they have like they like four nukes like your 20 megaton bombs or whatever We still have they don't have it by the way, that's anything too at the beginning of the movie It's like so I think they said North Korea's dead They don't want like a 10 mega 20 megaton bomb on the island or whatever North Korea does I don't think they have one megaton. They have kilo tons right now

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:29.513 --> 1:22:31.302]: 
  They're like dirty bombs, bitch. Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:30.795 --> 1:22:51.923]: 
  Yeah, exactly. They have... I think... I'm not gonna give a specific number, but they don't have Megaton bombs right now. Especially not a 20 Megaton bomb. So yeah, but it was like North Korea's gonna launch the Luke's. It was like... Maybe if they would've... If James Franco would've found a plan for Kim Jong-un to invade the South Korea or something. That's a little bit grounded.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:22:51.923 --> 1:23:08.427]: 
  It's still a little bit forgivable though since it is like a over-the-top. It's a comedy, but it just felt weird It was like I always like movies like even if it's comedy it could be more grounded Yeah, exactly on the dead was way cooler because of that. Yeah, you're right actually yeah But I know I'm just saying like that like the average viewer doesn't know that that's an unplausible

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:54.825 --> 1:22:54.960]: 
  It's

 SPEAKER_03 [1:23:00.192 --> 1:23:00.951]: 
  Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:23:07.347 --> 1:23:07.667]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:09.929 --> 1:23:13.017]: 
  The average viewer is a poor.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:12.612 --> 1:23:26.432]: 
  But for comedy, I gotta say for comedy, I don't hate Seth Rogen. I think Seth Rogen meets some really funny stuff. I think he meets some good movies. Do you like the Green Hornet? No. I never saw that one. I like this is the end. I thought Pile of Express was always... I thought they were fine. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:16.290 --> 1:23:17.843]: 
  I like the road

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:20.273 --> 1:23:21.235]: 
  Do you like the green hornet?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:26.078 --> 1:23:27.428]: 
  Pineapple express is really good

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:27.360 --> 1:23:29.993]: 
  They're good movies. They're not better than horrible. They're not amazing.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:29.993 --> 1:23:41.130]: 
  They're what they are they're like more Seth Rogen or Paul Rudd Rogan, I think I think Paul Rudd's charming. Who's more charming?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:34.920 --> 1:23:37.789]: 
  Seth Rogen. I'm actually sure that's the whole up for it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:42.160 --> 1:23:43.949]: 
 這些字是用來的是通知

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:43.290 --> 1:23:48.167]: 
  If you met Seth Rogen, you'd be like, oh, man, Seth Rogen.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:46.193 --> 1:23:46.632]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:23:48.167 --> 1:24:05.194]: 
  I'd be like sweet dude, you're cool. Thanks man. And I'd be like, I might be able to meet him. These guys had a pitch with his manager. Oh yeah, she was cool with that. It was Oyo's for Point Grey Studios. Zach and Chris. She was my favorite mate. She was my favorite Hollywood meeting agent.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:49.737 --> 1:23:49.855]: 
  it

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:52.487 --> 1:23:53.500]: 
  I might be able to meet him.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:23:57.111 --> 1:23:58.005]: 
  Oh yeah, she was cool.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:58.005 --> 1:23:58.664]: 
  Oh, you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:01.819 --> 1:24:03.439]: 
  She was my favorite mate.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:04.620 --> 1:24:07.776]: 
  Yeah, she honestly was. She was the coolest. She was like, oh, he's really good shit. It was a go.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:07.776 --> 1:24:27.655]: 
  I have a side little story about Seth Rogen. It's sort of related. This goes back to when Tom and I went to see Greg Cistero from the room. Right. Yeah, basically, for those who are familiar with the movie The Room, that cult movie,

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:09.717 --> 1:24:10.949]: 
  Sort of, sort of.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:10.949 --> 1:24:11.775]: 
  was it

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:20.095 --> 1:24:20.432]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:20.432 --> 1:24:20.500]: 
  Thank you very much.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:24:20.500 --> 1:24:21.580]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:21.580 --> 1:24:22.542]: 
  I love this place.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:27.655 --> 1:24:29.055]: 
  Toby was all original.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:24:28.988 --> 1:25:34.514]: 
  Yeah, yeah, Tommy was a Greg from the room. He was having a little thing in the city where, you know, it's basically showing clips behind the scenes clips of the movie. He was doing a live reading of some of the scripts from them from the old script, previous scripts of the movie. Really milking that movie. He plays Mark and all fairness. It was interesting. The whole thing was interesting. A lot of funny behind the scenes footage of like Tommy was out doing these weird like jeans commercials and before he was known for this movie. But anyway, he was Facebooking Tom for the longest time. Like those two are going back and forth because Tom and I made a game based on the room, which has gotten like a few million views. And I did the music. Chris Chris did the music, which was fucking great, by the way. The Pokemon version of the of the room theme, which somehow worked perfectly. I don't know how. But, uh, yeah. So, you know, him, you know, I think Greg had like a total crush on Tom. So he he's he bit Greg was basically, hey, Tommy, you're going to come to the show. And Tom's like, all right. And he brought me along and.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:44.007 --> 1:24:45.829]: 
  We're really milking that movie.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:25:09.674 --> 1:25:09.944]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:25:09.944 --> 1:25:10.939]: 
  Auf eine neue horsepower, die wir해� Engineers haben.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:25:10.939 --> 1:25:11.479]: 
  Yeah, Chris.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:25:13.521 --> 1:25:14.027]: 
  way.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:25:19.208 --> 1:25:20.069]: 
  That's sweet.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:25:35.796 --> 1:27:51.758]: 
  you know, after the whole show, they're talking and signing, you know, and this is not to get too off track. I'll get back on track in a moment, but we both bought the book and we went up to get it signed. And Tom got his sign in and all went smoothly. And I'm like, I'm sitting down and just like, I know something fucked up is going to happen here. And I go up and I'm like, hey, Greg, and you know, I give my book and open it up. And the book is pre signed by the book is pre signed by by Greg like, hey, like some generic message and it says his signature and something, the other writer signature. And I guess there were a pile of these books they were just going to give out to people. But I pulled the book, they could pull the book from the wrong pile for me for. So your years are already signed. Yeah, it was not supposed to be signed because like everybody at the show is supposed to get their signed personal. You were. Yeah, exactly. You know, it's weird about that. What? One time I was with Zach picking up his girlfriend from the airport in Philly. And I saw that book there, the disaster artist. Yeah. And I bought it at the airport and it was also signed. So I guess he signed a I guess he signed a million and just put them all over the city. So yeah, so I guess because, you know, he was totally ignoring me. He's like, I'm just the artist of the game. Fuck me. But, you know, he's talking to Tom and, you know, he's like his terrible man crush on Tom. He's like, you know, Tom. And he told Tom this incompetence. You know, the show. And he's like, you know, I have a deal with, you know, the what's his name? James Franco and Seth Rogen. They're gonna they're gonna write a movie based on this book, Tom. And then Tom told me this outside where he didn't knew me, knew this was not public knowledge at the time. And I'm like, oh, shit. He's like, and Tom's like, yeah, you know, he, you know, he was going to. And he said he's going to invite me to the premiere of the movie. Well, I'm like, what about me, motherfucker? I made the game to you. You did all the iron. Yeah, I spent just as much time as fucking Tom on this movie, on this game. Motherfuckers, like fucking Greg. Fucking Greg. Fuck you, Greg. He's a very handsome man. He is very handsome. So, you know, I feel a little dejected. I'm like, God damn it. And yeah, maybe maybe if I sucked his dick on Facebook like everybody else. But.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:26:29.408 --> 1:26:29.762]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:36.175 --> 1:26:36.698]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:26:39.499 --> 1:26:41.389]: 
  So I guess he's signed it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:26:59.834 --> 1:27:01.184]: 
  You know what I'm saying? Yeah, this shit.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:27:06.634 --> 1:27:07.478]: 
  James Franco.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:27:41.717 --> 1:27:43.641]: 
  Pewdiepie is very, very handsome

 SPEAKER_01 [1:27:52.821 --> 1:28:17.324]: 
  Um, so yeah, so I guess, you know, Tom's like, well, you know, I'll ask Greg to send you a ticket too. Yeah, that fucking happens. I'm like, oh yeah, thanks. Thanks, Tom. That's great. Fuck all you guys. I don't need it. I don't need your fucking ticket to your fucking movie premiere. You cunt's fine. Whatever.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:28:17.459 --> 1:28:24.360]: 
  Jeff would you be surprised if you logged in at Hubs Facebook and you saw pictures on between them of Greg's stuff

 SPEAKER_01 [1:28:23.584 --> 1:29:38.610]: 
  Oh, I took pictures of them together. They looked like they were in love. No, none of this is Tom's fault, by the way. This is just Greg being all Hollywood, I guess. Well, he's made it. So, yeah, I don't know. So, assuming now that these two are hot shit because of this room, I guess, for the interview, I guess they're just going to go ahead and make the movie now, based on this... I think they're in top condition, which would be interesting. James Franco's playing Tommy. He actually has this dumb kind of snap. The eyes. But he wrote about the game in the book, and I'm assuming the game is not going to be in the movie at all, but... Yeah, so let's see. He mentioned it in the book, right? He just said this game is fucking gay. I hope he understands. Everybody who's every actor from the room played the game. Really? And they meant talked about it on their Facebook pages. Yeah. Denny talked about it. I think... Lisa. I don't know if Lisa did, because I think we pretty much drew her as this disgusting monster. This topless monster in the game the whole time. And Tommy, I think, had Tommy's blessing, I guess. So that went pretty well.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:28:54.195 --> 1:28:57.098]: 
  He actually has this dumb kind of skin.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:29:06.784 --> 1:29:10.345]: 
  Yeah, so I'll see. He mentioned it in the book, right? So, if I... What you mentioned about it in the book.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:29:10.142 --> 1:29:10.497]: 
  Tchau, tchau.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:29:12.201 --> 1:29:13.855]: 
  Everybody everybody who's

 SPEAKER_03 [1:29:27.372 --> 1:29:29.042]: 
  Disgusting monster.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:29:38.205 --> 1:29:44.432]: 
  Isn't he really weird about that? Does he like pull reviews of YouTube and stuff of his movie? Yeah. I heard he was really weird about like, uh...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:29:42.492 --> 1:29:43.167]: 
  The hoodie was really weird.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:29:44.027 --> 1:30:16.495]: 
  We were super nervous. It's after we were gonna spend like three weeks on this and after a few months passed, we were like, what if he fucking tells us to take it down? So we made sure to promote the sale of the DVD as much as possible. And you had to change the name. You just called it the room when you first uploaded it. Then you changed it to the tribute. Yeah, the room tribute. But that was fun to make. I could talk more about that maybe at a later podcast or something. It's gone off for two hours now. But for now, we're all going to go to sleep.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:29:58.506 --> 1:29:59.924]: 
  as much as possible.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:30:01.257 --> 1:30:02.168]: 
  You just called it the room.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:30:10.622 --> 1:30:11.601]: 
  Yeah, podcast or something.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:30:17.794 --> 1:30:26.502]: 
  That was a trumpet. He's crazy. He's a freak. This has been Sleepycast. Annihil. This is... Absurd. Absurd.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:30:26.502 --> 1:30:28.004]: 
  Okay! I'm Jeff.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:30:28.004 --> 1:30:34.450]: 
  Don't hold on!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:30:30.771 --> 1:30:33.944]: 
  I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.
