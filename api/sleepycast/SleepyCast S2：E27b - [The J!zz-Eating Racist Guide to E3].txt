 SPEAKER_02 [0:01:56.310 --> 0:01:56.952]: 
  IALL Y

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:16.155 --> 0:02:20.948]: 
  You get a program don't ruin this I just want to make sure

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:22.045 --> 0:02:32.744]: 
  She sniffs her and just like... She does the thing with us! Yes she does! Yes she does! Alright I believe it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:25.994 --> 0:02:26.669]: 
  What?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:33.992 --> 0:08:13.365]: 
  And then the gameplay was just like, if this is gameplay, it just feels too much like it's just on-rails, scripted events stuff. And I know, you know, Naughty Dog. You're upsetting everyone already. I don't fuck you. Everybody knows this by now, right? Like when you see quote-unquote gameplay video. It just, it feels very like, just the way like characters move. The difference, the difference between it. We watched that Ghosts game by Sucker Punch. Yes. And there's like, disjointed- Ghost stuff took a shit. Neema? Yeah, yeah. That felt real. Yeah, because there's like disjointed movement and awkward dialogue. It felt like gameplay. It felt like the horse thing. Yeah, it's just like this like, almost like a mannequin turning and talking very loudly to his horse. But it's so fucking weird because you don't see his mouth move. It's like his, it's just his face is there. It's like an old PlayStation 2 game. I guess it's like a thing where like they normally, like they don't show any UI now in gameplay footage. Yeah, that's what it is. It's like it makes it more cinematic, but it also makes it hard to believe that what you're seeing is actual gameplay. Yeah, they kinda had like gameplay things like they had like, oh, she selected an arrow and shot an arrow. But then as she was moving, it felt way too cinematic and almost like the gameplay disappeared. You're saying for Last of Us. Last of Us 2, yeah. Yeah, they showed like some stuff that really felt like it wasn't gameplay because it was just too perfectly set up in cinematic. Oh, I'm gonna go over here and just observe this murder scene and then I'm gonna walk over here. Yeah, but a lot of games I do feel like especially in the beginning, like the beginning of God of War, if you were to watch somebody play the first 10 minutes of that, you would have felt like this whole entire thing was scripted. Because you do like personally move the character maybe a few steps and then a scripted event happens. That's what it is. Then you push the fucking punch button 10 times and then there's another fucking scripted event that happens. It's just kind of disjointed because like there's a point where she picks up an arrow and you clearly see an arrow like a thing. Yeah. But there's another time where she's just walking by and she fucking yanks an arrow out of this dude's jugular and there was no impromptu thing. Yeah. It just happened. Yeah. And then that immediately went to like an attack scene. It just, some stuff might have been gameplay, but you know they have to like sell this to you. So based on the trailer that you saw, because I didn't see it, what do you think? Ign gives it a... Is it girlfriend hot? 10 out of 10. 10 out of 10. Right. I didn't see it. She made it out with a black chick. 10 out of 10. Done. There's a spliced edits that people have kindly done already where it's just like a seamless kiss. Yeah. You can start to finish. It does seem like video games are the point where it's like... I'm gonna wait for Shad to make Ellie sniffing the ass. Do you think it'll ever be like MTD's like video game best kiss award? Do you think the mocap actors they just made out on stage? I think, you know, they had to have. They got into it. Yeah they did. There was some heavy breathing. And that was PlayStation. And then after they revealed some indie shit. They're gonna have ball suits on them. Exactly. The people with pumballs over there. The people who came up next. So was Death Stranding last? Death Stranding was second to last. Okay. Did you see everything the whole weekend so far? Yeah. I didn't see anything. No. I missed Microsoft. Did they do at least like an apology for seeing thieves? They fucking Shanghai'd a bunch of trailers from PS4 and put them on their thing. Not saying that it's not that, but it just feels kind of weird when things like Dark Souls and Double Me Cry. People say that Double Me Cry was announced on the platform. Wait, didn't they do the From Software game? They did the From Software Shadows Die Twice or Cerrico, Sakura or whatever. They were the ones. That was the Microsoft game. Yeah, they secured that trailer. What a piss in the face of PlayStation, right? I know. But at the same time. At the same time, there were like so many fucking Samurai games that were announced on the PlayStation. Not only that, but like games where some dude lost his hand. Devil May Cry. It was like, let's tell the story of a young man who loses his hand in battle and gets an augmented hand and then fights with the sword. With the sword? With the white hair? I thought that was the DMC guy. Everybody thought that. It looked like my old person who used to do sanity with, what the fuck's his name? Dex. Dex, yeah. But white hair Dex. Yeah, white hair Dex. I was saying the day. Dex, that's where you saw the CD release. I'm looking for a Devil May Cry 5, but it could have easily been a trailer to DMC 2 and a Devil May Cry 5. But it was Devil May Cry 5. The only thing, you know, there's this little disconnect there. People are convinced themselves it's good because I mean I guess they're just holding that up because it's like the same creator as 3 and 4. Yeah. Well they clearly look good. They got old Dante. No, I'm not going to be cynical about it. Is that old Dante? Yeah, yeah, on the motorcycle. Oh, on the motorcycle? Yeah. Sure, but I'm just saying like you're still playing like an edgelord cringed tween who's fucking, like they gave him white hair I guess to make him more like. You're playing like a Blink 182 member, but it's still going to be cool because it's by Capcom. I don't know. It's been a Devil May Cry guy. I hope Stamper plays. I want to hear what Stamper has to say about it. He'll say three words, chicken pot pie, black and bones sheet. And then he'll be like, Devil May Cry is worthless. And I want to be like, what are you talking about? Even I'm talking about DMC, Devil May Cry 5 was awesome. That's my Stamper review. That's pretty good. I think when we go in October to like, we should probably record something with Stamper. I like how, I like how confident you said we, because that sounds like a commitment that you just made for Jeff. Well, Jeff, we did it. Yeah, did. When he said we, that sounds like you. Well, it was like, well, it was like Tom was going to go out there and we were all going. I'm going to let you guys off. Jeff, I'm not even. Jeff's not even here. I don't even know what you're talking about. Jeff, let's be honest. You told Stamper, what's your problem with going to LA? Because it sucks. So what? We're there. We're all your friends. Yeah, exactly. Shut the fuck up. The thing is, why go when I could just not go?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:41.924 --> 0:02:47.459]: 
  You know, I'm not a dog. You're upsetting everyone, buddy. I don't fuck you. Everybody knows this by now, right?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:49.349 --> 0:02:51.593]: 
  I don't know what video.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:58.512 --> 0:02:59.811]: 
  Yes. Sucker punch?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:00.672 --> 0:03:01.414]: 
  Good stuff.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:03.692 --> 0:03:05.819]: 
  That felt real.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:08.434 --> 0:03:11.168]: 
  It felt like gameplay. It's like the worst thing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:23.858 --> 0:03:25.039]: 
  I guess it's a good thing we're the

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:28.920 --> 0:03:31.739]: 
  Yeah, that's good. Because it makes it more cinematic, but it also makes it more...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:34.219 --> 0:03:35.281]: 
  is actual.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:45.441 --> 0:03:45.509]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:03:46.808 --> 0:03:47.888]:

I don't understand how beaners an insult because they bring coffee beans. Oh, you're right. OK, OK. Maybe a wet pack, but a beaner. What's up Chuck? There's even beaner needs. Exactly. See, that sounds like something I'm not going to say. Is it just coffee beans? Yeah, mules, coffee beans. Wait, wait, mules and coffee beans? We took a coffee brand. Dude, Carlos walking out the donkey and the bean. Yes. All right, let's discuss horrible words. Wet pack, beans. Who's deserving here of the wrath of Twitter? Like, which one of us? Not me.

Bring on the line. People are probably like, why are you being such a system? I'm like, I don't feel like dealing with this. Listen, this is just, we're just having a topic of discussion. This is topics that people want to hear. Listen, as a Chinaman, I'm curious, where does chink come from? Now, my chink. It's the type of chink. So just chink. I don't think chink chong ping pong. It's the same thing. Yo, but chink is very different. That's like a sound effect. That's an onomatopoeia. Chink is the, I guess. Why don't they just call it manias? The chines you make when you close your eyes. Oh, look at that chink. Well, there's a lot of porcelain that they made. I don't know, porcelain pots, and they just chink it. Or the railroads. When they were doing it, like on the railroad, when they were fucking like, you know, chink, chink, chink. When they were like, how the fuck that word came about. We talked about this for the longest time. I thought like zipper head was like a joke for like the eyes, like zipper head. No, and then yes, it was the chink. And then I found out it was the chink thing. Very dark. That's fucked up. That's fucked up. That's wild to me. Because I had the control. Especially if you call somebody that, right? Like, you're not even just saying like a racial profile at that point. You're literally saying like something about your head getting run over by fucking tank treads. Like, that is, that to me is dark as fuck. Would you like to, would you like me to cover the chink thing from Wikipedia and record? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't actually know. Chink, also chinky.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:35.997 --> 0:15:36.722]:

  We talked about it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:18.494 --> 0:17:24.452]: 
  No, and then yes, it was the same thing. Very dark. That's fucked up.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:23.440 --> 0:17:24.502]:

  like iron IE chicken chicken chicky chicky chick a chick a pooh no you sound like a fucking Pokemon in English language ethnic slur referring to person Chinese ethnicity so okay all right you sound like a race it is from it is it is originated from the Chinese courtesy Qing Qing okay that would be the right word China hold you of Queen no that would be change if it's a cue you that's China's will change yeah Qing dynasty chinchon another possible origin is that Cheng evolved from the Indo-Iranian word for China which is what tongue so naturally don't say okay

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:56.279 --> 0:17:57.021]: 
  No!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:59.063 --> 0:17:59.907]: 
  In English language?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:06.218 --> 0:18:08.445]: 
  You sound like a racist figure to me.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:16.782 --> 0:18:20.342]: 
  That would be the end of the word China. Told you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:22.266 --> 0:18:26.569]: 
  So that would be Qing. If it's a QU, that's Qing dynasty. Qing dynasty.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:31.733 --> 0:18:32.459]: 
  Which is what?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:34.079 --> 0:18:34.517]: 
  Okay

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:37.420 --> 0:19:01.534]: 
  It's too racist. The first word, chink, is from approximately 1880. As far as can be ascertained, it's adjective form chinky, first appeared in print in 1878. Just to let you know, this is Jeff. He's not reading any sort of article. You fucking racist. Yeah, no. He's recalling this. You pulled out his compressed chink memories. This is Jeff's autism. His racist autism. I'm just so old, I remember this article in 1878.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:46.262 --> 0:18:47.376]: 
  Just to let you know, this is...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:49.401 --> 0:18:54.194]: 
  You fucking racist.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:55.307 --> 0:18:59.948]: 
  Jeff's autism is racist autism. I'm just so old I remember this.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:02.142 --> 0:20:17.134]: 
  You're a bull it goes on for a while. That's too long. That's fine. It was funny when you said ching ching So apparently no, but you're right apparently it comes from ching ching. Would you like to know the words? It's comparable to sure since I'm just going down this road and the module not stop now You know what? Your words these are the words this is a wicked p. You can't fucking man. Yeah, I'm here I've already dug two feet into the ground. Let's go full six go okay. Well you see excited compared in degree Offensiveness to terms I can bleep them go in degree of turn offensive that you're not gonna bleep them. I know you're not say I might offensive This to terms such as nigger Diego Jap and pike as well as packy Similar to the controversial Appropriation of the word The word chink has someone oh wait the word you already said the word Why did you beep yourself? You've already said it using a positive manner. Oh really for example Lee? Who Leeham Wang a Taiwanese American musician named his Asian hip-hop fusion John John Ra chinked out

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:04.184 --> 0:19:05.078]: 
  You should discuss that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:07.744 --> 0:19:08.639]: 
  So apparently

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:10.056 --> 0:19:11.895]: 
  it comes from Ching Ching.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:17.363 --> 0:19:22.780]: 
  now you know what and you know what these are your words these are the words this is a

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:24.282 --> 0:19:25.530]: 
  Yeah, I'm just...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:28.315 --> 0:19:28.517]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:35.537 --> 0:19:38.204]: 
  You know what I'm saying? I'm stopping now.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:43.502 --> 0:19:43.958]: 
  I'm not saying it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:49.982 --> 0:19:52.075]: 
  As well as Paki

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:02.335 --> 0:20:03.449]: 
  You already said the word.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:03.449 --> 0:20:08.258]: 
  Why didn't you beep yourself? You've already said it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:17.860 --> 0:23:10.424]: 
  In order to neutralize the term. Okay. He took back the word. He did. They did the same thing with the zipper head stuff. The zipper head. Eventually, Wang hopes the term will become quote cool. No. Alright, I'm doing this. I think it already is. As soon as it was like, no, we'll appropriate it. I'd reappropriate it and make it cool. Let's go back to shooting babies in the head. I don't know why I'm saying that. Whoa, babies. Yeah. Well, we're just talking about controversial words. We're just making a topic of discussion. Why? Okay, so what's your deal with Reena? He's very unfitting for the whole. His head, he feels like his fucking head is super imposed on a fucking weird mannequin. His head was never meant to be scanned and put it to like a virtual space. Well, you're just saying because he's emo hair, just like, spread over his head. He's got this indescript expression on his face. You can, it's just kind of this squinty. I like his squinty face. He just looks like a guy that has the fist really mad. Yeah, he does. I just don't know what else he's... He's up to the jet. And he's got that really sporadic goatee. Like he's a teenager trying to grow a beard. Yeah, yeah. It's also when he emotes. He's a man in a lawless world. When he emotes, he's like, I'm fucked. Yeah, no. That was actually my favorite part of the whole trailer. He's like, what's your status? My status is fucked. That was good. I like that. But it's just like, yes, it's like, he's in care. He's like giving up. He's not dare to criticize anything about this. You guys are shitting on this, but the fucking MSP Invert Man kicks Spider-Man in the head with no audio over it. That's true. Fuck! So sorry, does anyone actually know comic books? Because we're talking about the fabulous six, right? And that's going to be Scorpio, Voltro, Rhino, fucking Electro. What are the other O's? Indivisible O, Mysterio. No, who was that dude? Who was the dude who was Invert-O? Mr. Inverted, that's his fucking... Who was it? I've never seen that guy in my life. Mysterio has his fucking fishbowl on his head. I understand he does, but they clearly... It looks like he looks like a negative of a photograph. He looked like Darkiplier. But he does look... Is it Seahoe or Darkiplier? I'm sorry, get with the times. Are you in good friends with those guys? I like... Yes, I'm friends with Markiplier. He's good. Did he talk to you now? Did he talk to me now? Yeah, we've talked. Alright. He's a good guy. He said once he went up to him. I met him at a maker party, and I saw him, and I walked up in it. And I said, are you Markiplier? And he said yes. And I said, are you Chinese? And he said no. And then I said... That's awkward, man. And then I said... You're gonna break the ice. No, you're hoping to make a bond, like bond with him. Like, Chinese brothers? Yeah, I was trying to find a Chinese brother. You were Chinese, I'm Chinese. Yeah. Then I walked away. I was like, you know what? This clearly isn't working out how I expected. Well, you probably stuck to him, because everyone else who came out to him, like, pissed off. Okay, that's when they like, pissed themselves in the air. You were probably the first person to actually make things awkward.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:18.434 --> 0:20:19.311]: 
  That's neat.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:22.214 --> 0:20:22.770]: 
  Que bê

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:28.879 --> 0:20:30.449]: 
  No, I don't have any ideas.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:35.072 --> 0:20:37.485]: 
  reappropriate it and make it cool.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:39.291 --> 0:20]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:44.624 --> 0:20:46.767]: 
  We're just making a topic of discussion.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:09.008 --> 0:21:15.623]: 
  He just looks like a guy that has the pistol in his face. Yeah, he does. I just don't know what else he's...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:20.331 --> 0:21:21.175]: 
  It's also many emotes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:21.175 --> 0:21:21.732]: 
  He's a man.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:24.685 --> 0:21:24.769]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:31.232 --> 0:21:32.430]: 
  That was good, I like that.

  No, no, no, that's not fair. Take that out. Take a shot of your brother. Here's my answer.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:46.440 --> 0:26:48.955]: 
  So what happened? Take a photo. Exactly what happened.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:51.402 --> 0:27:05.492]: 
  I was gonna make it easy on you. Get ready for the answer. I would drop Tom. No. No, no, no. I would drop Tom, pull my brother up, and I'd be like, I'd be so angry. I would then jump to my own death.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:56.937 --> 0:26:58.371]: 
  No! No, no, no.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:07.332 --> 0:27:08.108]: 
  Oh god.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:09.002 --> 0:27:31.665]:

All right Well, here's the situation is the one who's dropping like cinder blocks on cars like the good son was and Johnny's little So no, no, is that is that your brother? Which one is it?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:13.525 --> 0:27:13.542]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:17.052 --> 0:27:19.364]: 
  Well here's the situation, is Tom the one who's...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:22.840 --> 0:27:22.992]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:22.992 --> 0:27:24.240]: 
  No, no.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:25.776 --> 0:27:27.649]: 
  I'm gonna go to 10 for an asset.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:32.678 --> 0:27:47.309]: 
  I mean, you know, I don't know who'll be more offended by this conversation. Tommy, your brother, your brother might be like, yeah, no, just got it. Look, can you just, you just figure this out? Yeah. Pick up yourself. You got like 15 seconds before I lose.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:33.505 --> 0:27:36.120]: 
  I don't know who will be more offended by this

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:38.871 --> 0:27:40.778]: 
  Yeah, no, just got it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:42.297 --> 0:27:44.811]: 
  Ya rang all sp please.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:48.270 --> 0:28:25.952]: 
  To be fair, in the Goodson situation, the kids were like, like, 12. This is like full grown men. Dude, one is harder than the other. Tom does a lot of good for this world, and the fact that I feel like just the fact that he has a family and two kids, I feel like that automatically puts him above. I feel like I just have to kill anyone else. And even if he was dangling, he'd be like, Woooo, he'd be kind of scared. He'd be like, I don't know, I'd be scared. I think they both would be scared, I think. I'd be scared. Dude, you know what Tom would say, Tom would look down and he'd be like, You think I'd smash you a thousand pieces if I hit the ground? You think it'd drop on like flat concrete? It's like jigs, rocks. He would hit, he'd be like, you think I'll spray shit out of my ass?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:52.270 --> 0:27:52.894]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:53.839 --> 0:27:57.045]: 
  Dude, it's a little harder than a hundred-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:02.125 --> 0:28:02.564]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:03.542 --> 0:28:04.504]: 
  Tom's a good person.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:04.504 --> 0:28:05.264]: 
  And even if

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:09.364 --> 0:28:12.300]: 
  He's like, I don't know that job. Both will scare you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:18.224 --> 0:28:20.957]: 
  You don't even get to drop on like flat.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:22.037 --> 0:28:22.746]: 
  Rocks

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:26.999 --> 0:38:06.081]: 
  You say something totally vulgar and fucking random. He probably would. He'd be like, Jeff, we don't have to put the fart button in, please. You'd be like, Jeff, you don't fucking need it. Jeff, will you please finish Nightmare Cops even after I go down? No. Would you not find somebody else to fucking limit that guy? I mean, it would be hard because Tom also cares a lot. I don't think anyone could just take his files and... And he also brings his own style and... In the code, yeah. And just in general, like how he is, he helps write it. We make the game together. On a side note, I have to admit, when we were playing, even though it's still being tweaked, it does feel so fucking seamless. We have it to test the combat, and also it might end up being like a dedicated feature, but we do it to see how broken characters are and to like test things. Right now, I wasn't telling anyone it's like a big thing in the game. It's just right now, it's like a side... No, it's like for testing. We need to see how characters fighting. I personally thought it was super fun to play against. It is fun, but it really helps with seeing like balance and show. Nice. You know, and you were mentioning like an ability during the game to be able to like turn on like a friendly fire mode where you could like actually battle each other. There was another game that did that. Was that Battletoads? There was another game I remember that you could literally push a certain thing of buttons and all of a sudden you can start like hitting the people around you. Really? Yes, I absolutely remember that. Somebody listening to this will know what I'm talking about. Tom's games kind of do both. I mean like yeah, Cows are Crashes at the end of every stage does that. I know what you're talking about. I know exactly what you're talking about, but I don't know what you're even doing. I'm so glad anyone even remembers that game. SNES had so many fucking fun games that like a lot of people A, never played or B, don't even remember. Or can't play anymore. I don't know what collection of games that I think I played a lot that nobody ever heard of. Like one of my favorite games is Stupid Ass. I was really into like Fighter Jets as a kid because I don't know, I watched Top Gun Ope. Yeah, let's forget the volleyball in the locker room scenes. Like I love the dogfights. Yeah. I love the dogfights. So I like model F-14s and shit and I love this game called Captain Skyhawk and it's like a garbage game, but it was just like this little third person, you just fly this little F-14 over this stupid ass fake polygonal landscape. Did it look like Flight Simulator, like third person shit? No. I mean Top Gun, the actual Top Gun Nintendo game did and it was terrible and incredibly hard and impossible to play. Yeah. Like the hardest thing in the game was landing on the aircraft character. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, after the level or something. It was just so hard. It was so hard. Because you'd always be too low or whatever you were writing that. I fucking, oh my god, dude, on the F, sorry, that was just an NES game. That was the original NES. I remember that. Oh yeah. Landing was the hardest part of that whole fucking game. It's funny, my dad like who never plays video games, he played it one time and he actually fucking landed the thing. I was like what the fuck, I couldn't do it. Yeah. I absolutely remember that. NES and SNES were games that like, I had like the main games but the things that I had a lot of really random games for was the Sega Genesis. I was the only kid, I was the stupid Genesis kid in the class. Everyone else had a Super Nintendo. Yeah. So I got to trade, we traded systems so I'd always get my Genesis out and I'd get a Super Nintendo with like 10 games I've never played before at a single time. Also Sega had the more edgy games like Splatterhouse. Yeah, it had more content. And fucking like, yeah, no, they had like the creed, like the fucking bloodier games and shit in Nintendo was always like, it was like the cheat for Mortal Kombat was literally like more blood. Yeah, okay. That was literally the fucking code to get blood in Mortal Kombat. I remember that code. It was so simple and it's like because they knew that like kids would play it and they wanted to be that future. I mean Sega is like, they were good with like archaic games. Yeah, it was very funny. No, they also had Alter Beast. They also had, what else is there? Oh, two pieces fucking, no, they had Alter Beast. I'm just saying that they had like play. It's better as a memory than the actual game. It's like, it's fun to watch them transform with this like terrible compressed audio, but it's so fucking sluggish and awkward. Like, all my guys, he's like, yeah. What was he talking about? Golden Axe. Yeah. Golden Axe was also, that was also an arcade cabinet game. Golden Axe was awesome. Which would just suck up all your fucking money because it was way too OP for us. It's like you go through the game and then you get to the last level and it loses its fucking mind. No, no. Like Smash TV did that and the fucking X-Men game. Like a lot of those, if you're an adept player, you can get up to like the other levels and then they're just like, fuck you. You ever played X-Men game for Genesis? It was like the weird like ripped version of the arcade version. Do you remember what it did at the end of the game? No, I don't. The most fucked up thing ever. You had to reset like the evil computer or something in the game. What? And no, no. They had this. I didn't understand it. It was like a level for code to try and like figure it out and it's still fucked up. What is this? It's, you have to reset your fucking Sega Genesis. It says reset the computer. You literally have to press reset on the fucking Genesis to advance to the final stage. I never understood that. I was so confused. What in there? I used levels to like codes to get past it. No other game has done this. This is like some original like Metal Gear Solid fucking Kijima shit. It was wild. It freaked you out the first time. It's like, I'm on stage. I'm going to lose all my progress. I hit this fucking button, but it's telling me to hit the button and you do it and it fucking just lands you right into the next area. But that is literally the nightmare that you play. When you played those games on like a Nintendo or a Sega, the worst nightmare was somebody, your cat walked across your fucking console or your friend bumped into it and they fucking pushed the reset button. That was literally the worst nightmare. That's like friends running around and like jumping around near the end. And then they're telling you to fucking do that. Yeah. 64 console. That shit all, oh God. That was like the game you too also had like finicky, shaking shit. Big decisions. Because when you're a kid, you don't like memory cards, for me at least, like a memory card was like permanent. Like I had one memory card to use for every game. Yeah, no. And I would just delete the games that I was done with. So I would spend all this time with like one memory card. And before that, I didn't even have a memory card. I was playing like fucking games that just. You guys know how I lost my PS2 memory card? Oh. Dude, did you try to sub these? Did you try to sub these? Do you try to sub these? Do you sub dog pee on your fucking console or let them do so? The office and stole it. Oh yeah, some fucking dude up the street just came in. That's why there's like barred doors now. Crackhead came in and stole our PS2 and walked out. Wait, I thought they stole a bunch more than just that. They stole the developer. We had, this is that story where everybody just let the dude in here. Like he was filling a box full of like toys and games, consoles. Tom and, Tom, didn't Stamper like give him a thumbs up or was like, Hey, what's up, dude? Tom and Stamper went here early and this dude walked in. I don't know how or why he knew what was in here or if he was just guessing or what the fuck was he was on. But this is when the game room was closer to the door than it was now. So. So that's why it got moved over here. He walked in and he started like rummaging through the game shit in the game room. Stamper walked in and said, Hey man, and he didn't know who he was and the dude like gave him a thumbs up or something. Stamper walked back to his desk and got out and I am and he's like, Hey, Tom, who is the guy in the game room? And Tom's like, What guy? And by the time they went back, he was gone. There was a three, at the time like the 360 was new and there was a 360 in there and a PS2 dev kit. Oh shit. That's right. Your dev kit, which had like fucking shit you guys were developing on. It was most, a lot of dev kits don't play regular games, but this one did. But you guys were doing what castle crashes on that or? We what? Alien hunt? It was for a cast crash before it was ported to the 360. But we had like a stamp when I played all these games on it. We were playing like the street fair anniversary collection on it and it had my memory card of like a six years of games and the dude just took off with it. I fucking kill myself. Can you imagine if you wanted to go to the auditorium and take all the burnout shit that we have in there? I just, I roll up to the office and Tom's standing there in the rain looking around like a lost office. What happened? Do you think FromSoft's game is a response to Neo or do you think it's been in production for a long ass game? I think they thought about it for a while. I think it was like the next actual evolution. Yeah, I don't think it was like them going like, oh, Neo exists. We're going to do our game. They did medieval then they did like. But I always thought like as soon as I saw that trade like the 10 second trailer, my response wasn't, oh, they're trying to make a better Neo. But in my mind, I was like, they're making a Neo and they're making it better. Yeah. And I get it that there are other like FromSoft IPs that they could reference like ancient Japanese like lore based. Yeah. Seeing what happened. What's the name again? It's Seikryo. Cerico. Cerico. Sekario. Shadows die twice. It's like the only thing. It's the case where you just need a better name. It should just be called Shadows Die Twice. I mean, honestly, I feel like if we knew what that actually meant in Japanese probably means something that's really memorable. It's like Seriko or something like that. Yeah. And I'm sure it means. I'm sure. You know, can we look, you know. That's probably means Dark Souls. I just, I struggle with games. Shadows don't die or Shadows die twice. Japanese games that insist on naming it something that. Is it Shadows Don't Die or Shadows Die Twice? I don't know. Shadows die twice. I feel like if your entire English speaking country has, doesn't even know how to pronounce your game. I feel like you're kind of hurting on the marketing side. No, you say that, but within a year of it being out and people playing it, we're all going to say the words like it means make perfect fucking sense.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:44.110 --> 0:28:48.312]: 
  I mean it would be hard because Tom also carries a lot of Tom's arms.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:05.339 --> 0:29:05.440]: 
  We

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:05.440 --> 0:29:05.659]: 
  we have

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:06.807 --> 0:29:07.279]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:12.679 --> 0:29:14.502]: 
  Right now, I wouldn't tell anyone.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:16.476 --> 0:29:17.438]: 
  Just right now.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:17.438 --> 0:29:20.121]: 
  Just like for testing, we need to see how characters play.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:21.623 --> 0:29:22.095]: 
  It is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:33.621 --> 0:29:35.612]: 
  Yeah, they're just battling each other.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:44.843 --> 0:29:46.800]: 
  Yes, I absolutely remember that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:48.944 --> 0:29:49.500]: 
  I don't know what I'm talking about.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:49.500 --> 0:29:50.091]: 
  figure

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:56.892 --> 0:29:57.449]: 
  I'm so

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:05.903 --> 0:30:07.439]: 
  I don't play anymore.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:30.405 --> 0:30:31.469]: 
  but it was just like a little...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:37.240 --> 0:30:37.814]: 
  Did it look like it?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:40.041 --> 0:30:40.244]: 
  Now.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:47.972 --> 0:30:48.597]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:51.617 --> 0:30:52.950]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:52.950 --> 0:30:53.457]: 
  the level with

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:03.160 --> 0:31:03.548]: 
  That was easy.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:04.155 --> 0:31:05.438]: 
  Yes, I remember that. Oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:36.546 --> 0:41:38.301]: 
  I literally know I was just lying to myself.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:40.259 --> 0:41:46.064]: 
  Listen, for all of you know, there's a story there that we don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:49.405 --> 0:41:52.240]: 
  You play cowboy?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:50.451 --> 0:41:50.991]: 
  Bye, boy.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:05.183 --> 0:42:16.692]: 
  We're not fake internet celebrities. Yes! I'm just gonna say that. I love Koreans. Yes.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:19.881 --> 0:46:44.346]: 
  Well good, I'm glad we got that out of the way. I'm happy to name the video. I love Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Malaysians, and New Asians. Jeff lived in Korea. I visited it for two weeks. You loved it. I got a good understanding of the culture. You loved it. It was hot. He was almost murdered by a fan. I mean, sorry, an actual fan. A literal fan. You're talking a fan up again? That almost killed you. Look, I'm not trying to bring it up. I'm just mentioning the fact that you were almost murdered. Well, no, I got into a severe argument. Were they housing you? And then you were telling them? I never heard this. I stayed in a hotel. I never heard this, as you got an argument. Fan death. What's fan death? Fan death. Oh, I was thinking it was like a type of anime. The story of the sleepy cabin game. That running a fan at night in your room in Korea will possibly kill you. Yeah, it'll cut your head off for you. It'll split around in a thousand and one. There's two possible. Either it'll drop the temperature so quickly, it'll freeze, or it'll suck the hair out. The actual one, when it's somewhere outside, it frees the death. I had a bad nightmare as a kid that my fan, the electrical socket would burst into flames, and the fire would go up the cord. And then go into the fan, and it says, it's blowing oxygen on me. It was you to pillar a fire like Sephiroth on me. That says a whole lot about you and a lot less about fans. It's so real, I'm like, thank you. You wanna know something real? The manufacturer's actually put a switch on it to make it auto turn off. I've had a fan that actually sparked in like fucking, I don't know. I've had a fan that used to oscillate stuff in my room as a kid, and I never really thought of that kind of stuff as a kid, but one day my fan kind of exploded at the bottom. There's like yellow and lightning and shit at the bottom, and it just stops. Like Pikachu at the bottom is fucking fast. Yeah, it's something. Here's the logic real fast. They said a lot of, they said fan death kills a lot of elderly people because they have a fan running in the room when they die. I'm just like, maybe they just died because they're old. Yes. Well, that's confirmation bias, right? Because they're the fan. That's like, wow, look at these old people. If you put old people in a room and feed them raspberries, they fucking die. Raspberries kill people. That's just... Korea, it's just like, it's like Canada, it's like a bizarre America. The only two things I fucking hate about it is it's humid as fuck, and they don't believe in air conditioning. They have some fans sometimes, but... You just get like your own little... It's really weird when you walk through a mall or an airport and it's hot, it's fucking humid. Like, that would never fly in America. No, God, no. People would complain about it. No, somebody, yeah, somebody would walk right to the manager and go, excuse me, sir. Be like, I... Turn on the air conditioning, please. By the way, I said this earlier, but this is a hot tip to lonely nerds. This is the place for those. Hot tip to lonely nerds is like, yeah, that's the entire fan. That's us too, but go on. If you want a hot girlfriend, just go over to Korea. I like that advice. Because they're all one of like... They're thirsty. Every dude over there, speaking in English, some nerdy dude, had like a hot Korean girlfriend. Yeah, yeah. Did you try those like can of like cockroaches that they eat like fucking Doritos? You know what I'm talking about? I saw a bunch of weird snacks, no one in Triumph. I stuck to Kimchi and other, like the standard. In China, they had like whole like spicy vats of crawfish. And those... A, yes, delicious. B, they sold it with like Budweiser pictures. They got that in H-Mart. They got a bunch of weird shit. But I fucking loved that shit. But they look like cockroaches. They like fucking pull off. That sounds pretty awesome. If a cockroach was squished and red. They have like little like eyes still attached. They absolutely look like cockroaches. The eyes are like in the snack. You're gonna pull them off? Yes, and then you stick it in your mouth. I took a piece. Did you ever see this stuff? That looks yummy. They're like candy crab snacks. Those like break off in your mouth. What are they? No, those shells and everything. They're so like crystallized with sugar and fucking spices. You can fucking just eat... You're supposed to just eat those by mouthful. That's gross though. I don't want to eat like caramelized crabs. Yeah, you do. No, I don't. No, I don't. Just open your mouth. No, I don't.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:22.615 --> 0:42:22.952]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:48.734 --> 0:46:48.852]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:53.357 --> 0:52:48.002]: 
  You know what? You know what? No, I'm not gonna disagree. Don't say yes. I will say yes. Of all the foods. Of all the foods I've ever eaten. I think any... No, I've never eaten any other animals come but my own. You ate your own calm? I did once. Even I'm afraid to do that. Look! Look! Even chlorine! I've eaten my own boogers and at one point this shit... Look, I washed it farts in my face. But look, you're telling me... Wait, wait, wait. I'm gonna cross here. I don't know whether I want to ask go further or not. Are you telling me that you never booged somewhere when you were a kid? I have never created my own calm. You're not curious at all. I hate the fucking texture of calm. It is disgusting. Look, it came out of you and you weren't even curious? No! I'm like, eww! And I'm like, oh, immediately. Well, I will admit. It came out of my dick and I looked at it and I was like, I wonder what that means. I don't knock people who come but I hate it. I don't do that about my shit because I can smell it and it smells bad. I hate the texture of calm. I guess you're knocking half of humanity because... Okay, talking about... Wine cum? What I want. You're eating cum? No, I'm saying I wouldn't. You know, I'm not going around asking for cum. Would you fucking semen, okay? You started it so innocently. I asked him what was the weirdest foodie ever. And I don't... Wait, wait, which one of you ate cum? I didn't, but look, me, but my own. Look, look, I'm just saying, there's no animal, there's no animal, there's no vegetable, there's no like food thing. No! That girl feeds you with vegetables. I was alone in the dark, staring in a pile of cum on my bed, wondering what the fuck it is. You're laughing up like a dog? I don't judge you, but you made this up. I stuck my finger in it and I smelled it, and then I stuck it on my tongue, and I was like, ew, and then I was done. That's different, everybody. You guys try to make it sound like I fucking, like, just fucking... I said, I said, eat cum. That's a giant walk of just fucking cum and doused my body. That's like, if you pee a little bit and you tip a little tip, and it'll like, see? No, that's not like that actually. It is! It is! Who would do that? It's literally the same thing. Dude, I wouldn't do it to cum, but I'm saying the same fucking thing. Jeff, he's not eating any cum. He's like licking, licking a fucking microbe. Stop it! No, no, no. You compare a fucking bodily fluid. You're saying, looking at dollop of cum, looking at dollop of shit. That's not the same. Hold on, hold on. It comes out of the way. Wait a minute, I'm curious. I'm wet, I'm in the fucking case. No, no, no, no. You cum on like a shirt and then you're done, but like, you can't just... You can pee on the shirt. No, I would. Now I would, but back then I was curious, Jeff. Clinical trial time. You have three fingers. You drop a cum, I drop a piss, and I drop a shit. Piss the other one, though. I would take piss. You take two. I would take piss and cum over shit. What would you two choose? What? Your fingers have three things on them. You've got a drop of piss, a drop of cum, and a little dribble it of shit. I would piss. I would lick the pee. I take piss and cum. What are you gonna do? Cum and shit? You have two to choose. You have to choose two. Yes, yes. Cum and pee. I would totally choose cum and pee over eating shit. What's wrong with you? So, no, I don't like shit. Oh my god, the way you're saying it sounds like you've already got your mind on one shit. No, no, no, no. You are a shit man. I figured you need shit. Fuck off, why would I do that? Fuck, I've never fucking... Why would you belittle me is that? Cum, feces, pee. Eat it without no expression. Oh my god. If I had to do all three with a gun to my head, I'd do it... You would look me in the eye. You would do it just to spite everybody. With a gun to my head, I would not flinch. I'd do all three. But I wouldn't choose... Mick, Mick, Mick, Mick. Only one out of the three. Which one is it? You'd do a cum. A pee. Pee. Someone has to pee in your mouth. Cum in your mouth and cum in your mouth. No, no, okay, that's different. All three of those were very different from their being... I changed the fucking variable. There was a pee droppling. There was a cum droppling. I took away your dollop. I'm not getting a mouthful. I'm not getting a mouthful pack. You know what? No, no, no, no. You know what? Fine. Going with that. If I had to get a mouthful, if I had to open my mouth and let people pee in my fucking mouth, or shit in my mouth, or cum in my mouth, I would absolutely take piss over all of them. I ran to the police station. A doppelganger pee. I'm gonna pee now. Fuck all of you. All right, I ask. I will cyber make getting pissed in your mouth when you're with or when you cum their shit in your mouth. Okay, okay, pussy, pussy discharge. No, no, we're not adding that. It's the shit in the piss. Shut up! Whatever. What pussy discharge dollop of pee cum in feces? You're gonna compare ranted pussy discharge to a dollop of piss. I think we need to add another variable. What are you gonna add, Jeff? What if we just, what if we change just like a huge cup of piss, a huge cup of cum, versus like one drop of shit? That's pretty good. That's pretty good. A swivel of poop. A swivel. A swivel of poop. A swivel of fucking like J-Poop. So you got a big jug of horse cum, and a little picky of... Asparagus driven piss. Asparagus. Ranted pussy juices. Or a dollop of shit. A dollop of shit. I hate this pug. I hate this whole thing. I hate all of you. I'm gonna be brave, I'll say it first. I hate recording this. I will say it first. I got dragged into this after two years! For this! I wouldn't eat the dollop of...
