 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:45.019 --> 0:07:35.211]: 
  You know about this Korean boy? Our good friend Matt Vargas, shout out to him, check out his YouTube. He came to New York with, I mean Chris you can tell the story. That was Focus Travel by the way, Avoid Their Buses. My friend Matt came to New York with us on Halloween and he got very drunk and then he drank wax out of a candle. So for example, if you're in New York on the upper west side there's a great place called Jenkins Pickles. It has really good food, it's a little expensive but it's really fucking good food. Dude they're gravy, they're fucking biscuits and everything. Oh my god dude, they're meatloaf, it's covered in the sky. All the drinks they serve are like out of like pickle jars kind of things. And they also put candles on the tables out of the same jars. And our good friend Matt Vargas was so drunk he, a candle was blown, it wasn't like a lit candle but it was blown out to the house but the wax was just, like so excusable. If they're in the same jars and if it was blown out I can excuse it. And then so he drank it and we were like, but we looked at it, we didn't see it happen. We just saw that the candle was, like the wax got like, Matt, did you see it? He's like, oh yeah, I guess I did. Why are you doing his voice like that? He's got a beautiful booming radio voice. It's like, yeah, I'm on the radio. Did he really? It was just an emphase him, he didn't get third degree. Yeah, I bet I. I drank a candle. Have you ever had wax candy? Yes, I'll like give you a little. It is fucking heinous. I, my mom got me this, like I remember it just because I've never had wax candy before so I had my first time eating wax candy. There were these little fucking red wax lips and I was under the impression that you were supposed to like break them open and eat the center of them. So I like started taking my fork and cutting it. And I'm like, I asked my mom, I'm like, why the fuck is there, why didn't you say that? I'm like, why the heck is there candle wrapped around my cookie? And then she's like, it's not that. And then I bit into it and there was no fucking sugar. There was no flavor. It was like eating a goddamn edible candle and I spit it out. You know, have you ever accidentally eaten chalk? It's about the, you probably a better experience than eating candy. One time Zach was like, here try this nut and I bit into it and I'm like tooth like shattered. That was a pistachio you fucking aim even. Even like a little wall that breaks go. You should have pre-faceted situation with you. You should have broken the shell. Fucking gorillas know to peel the shell. But the pistachio is so strong. Yeah, my tooth hurt. It was funny because I heard it. I heard like a. Oh, that was a Frankenstein monster noise. It's just like like handing you a walnut and being like, here you go. It's like you're like, oh, there's a fucking shell around this bell. It's not your fault though. Like you didn't know you probably thought it was a. It looks soft. It's like white. They did the same thing with a prawn once. Just by through everything. What? A prawn. Did you know that it is common that people could actually. A hot dog cooker? No, a prawn. Did you know that it. A prawn, like a shrimp. You ate the shell of it? Yeah. Oh, I do it all the time. Sometimes you forget. I fucking throw at this. It tastes good, but my bum hurts sometimes. Yeah, I understand. Cause I tell everybody, I in my school, we used to crawl to the tables. We would like, we throw like shrimp tails and eat them off the floor. You didn't tell me this. Like pick his ass and like grab the shrimp tails and eat them. It was a kid in my school used to crawl on the tables and pull down your pants while the teacher was writing on the chalkboard and suck you off. Yeah. There was a kid who used to fucking bounce on the table. Really? Yeah, like look up, you'd look deep in the eye and just suck it on your cock. Like 30 seconds very fast and then you came and then you'd come and then he'd try and like crawl back to a seat and everyone would like go, yeah. And he got back to the seat. Oh really? You should say, now, now, don't fuss around. I would purposely stick my feet out and try to trip him while he was like have a mouthful of foam splat on the ground. All the boys in my class used to try and do the same thing but this kid was the king of it. He was just like, all these kids are like clustered under tables, crawling over each other, sucking each other around. Like guys are looking, trying to check it out. I remember one time, we were all in class with a really serious lesson about the Holocaust and the girl started screaming and she had come drizzled from the ceiling. And revealed was the black jen with his big eyes exposed only like the chest of her cat. What? His BVC dripping coming into some girl's hair. He receded back into the ceiling and crawled through the next classroom. Wait, the editor? Yes, he drizzled kill each other. I like how you referred to his shlong as a BVC.

  When you were a kid, I think it was this before. It makes sense. Well, I think it was this before, but, Chloe, when you were a kid, did you ever, like, roll your dick into itself and pull your ball sack over and spread it? Yes. Like, call it a flying squirrel? No, I would just push it. I would just shove it all in and let it explode out like a flower. You pulled your ball sack skin over your dick and you called that a flying squirrel. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You roll your fucking little chodey to itself. You pull your ball sack over and you stretch it out to expose the veins. You call it a flying squirrel. You fucking, yeah, you sure? Yeah, you sure? Or you just pull it out and make it fly like that. But you pull your balls over your dick and, like, it forms, like, a skin igloo. You show it, you put it in front of a light? Chris, look, you could also just do this. You pull your, like, do that. Yeah, you put it in front of a light and you can see all the sperm swimming around inside of your sack. It's like a little ant colony. It's fucking hot, dude. It's sperm. You can, like, squeeze the center of it and they all get confused and bunch up and explode. You can tap on the glass of your ball skin and fucking scare it. I'm not scaring you.

Cory, I want you to make a video of you tapping on your ball glass and smashing the glass in your sperms. Cory, those are kids? Did it explode and immediately dry up and die? Cory, those are kids? Can I stretch my dick off and put a little piece of cracker in it? They all carry the back to my asshole. Really? Yeah. This podcast is off to a really unbalanced start. It's just been pure retarded shit so far. I stuck like a small little... Here we go with this, Cory. I don't know what it was, but it was like a tiny straw thing? I saw it wiggling like he was trying to go down. I do believe it's... It was going down or out? It was going down. It was being inhaled. What? Why would it come out to go back down? Did you hear what he said? If you put a little crack in your dick hole, they carry it away like ants. Oh, come up and pull it back down. Did you know if you feed your sperm, it makes it more healthy to grow faster? They grow. Really? Yeah, they bring it to their queen and then the queen makes more sperm. They can tank if their queen keeps feeding it. I heard that there's like an evolutionary flying sperm that don't use their wings. They're just stuck in your ball sacs so they'll eventually couple up and grow. They'll eventually couple up and grow. They'll drink it up real quick. That's the flying sperm. Do you think it's like a colony? A colony of sperm? Yeah, they kind of act like ants, but they have their own... Cory, when I was in school, my teacher said, like, let me know the boys will be talking to girls. He's like, you know, I've done my own studies of myself. And whenever I come, if I listen to...

  And you gotta help us. But I wonder what's really there.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:58.440 --> 0:16:03.014]: 
  But I wonder what's for dinner. Hi.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:02.507 --> 0:17:38.239]: 
  What happened? What did this dissolve into? Please sir. I want to cover the house. But I won't cover the house. What if Dr. Eggman orchestrated the Holocaust, Cory? He's a feminist. He's based on, uh, what's his name? The American guy. The fat person in the head died in his bathtub. He's got his dirty ass grin. His dirty shitting grin. He's fucking twisted. He died with that smile when they froze his body and stuck him into the grave. You can still find him. He's still frozen. I caught him so low. At the Capitol, he's the middle of Congress. How do you drag that out of your head? Oh God, Cory. Oh no, you pop it open and smash it with a hatchet. I didn't know you do that. If you smash it open, there's a glowing crystal in his head. Cory, Cory, right now you're crossing a bridge. Cory, you walk to the woods. There's a long bridge, a misty bridge. And out in the water is a fucking fat, disgusting little pink man. The pink man with long breasts. Is he a primate or a man? We don't know. He's a small primate. What's he doing, Cory? Cory, he's a one inch tall primate. What's he do? Cory, you lift him up. He grabs on your fingers with slicky. He walks like an alien out of the trees and kicks a bucket across the floor. Cory, he's the size of a tiny tree toad. I pick him up and I toss him and he bounces back into the foggy mist. He sticks to the tree like those guys that you throw at walls and they flip down. Cory, you grab him and you kick him up your finger and he's like, do not be afraid. Answer my riddle. Answer my riddle and you will live. Cory, this is ready. I hold him into the air and a big white owl comes down and takes him away. You can see his small feet has brained through his translucent skin. It's beating, Cory. It's beating brilliantly. Seriously. This is his riddle. You ready? Yeah. If you're trapped in a room with a beanbag and you're hungry, what do you do? You use the beanbag. You cut it open and eat the peanuts inside the beanbag.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:11.991 --> 0:16:13.155]: 
  seven is he's based on

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:14.927 --> 0:16:15.450]: 
  The fact

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:21.019 --> 0:16:21.593]: 
  He does.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:29.187 --> 0:16:29.845]: 
  Who's beside me now?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:34.350 --> 0:16:35.987]: 
  Smash it with a hatchet. Learn how you do that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:39.497 --> 0:16:40.274]: 
  Cory, right there.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:48.914 --> 0:16:49.960]: 
  Veins.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:51.445 --> 0:16:51.951]: 
  It was long.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:52.491 --> 0:16:53.284]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:55.900 --> 0:16:57.554]: 
  He's a small private figure court.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:19.778 --> 0:17:21.094]: 
  I hold them into the air and it

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:25.566 --> 0:17:26.730]: 
  It's beautiful.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:27.726 --> 0:17:28.147]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:33.194 --> 0:17:33.210]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:39.269 --> 0:39:13.007]: 
  Why did you say peanuts not beans? Because peanuts are inside bean bags. Okay. What I was saying, okay, I was explaining bad humor. Like people that like try to understand like what makes bad humor good. It comes to a certain professionalism and people think like, oh, when you make something bad, but you are clearly capable of making something good and you can show that at other points, then that becomes like, it's clever, it's brilliant. But then you get something that's like, you know, the person made a movie or he made a thing and it was bad the whole time. There's no change in quality. It's the exact same from start to finish. There's no differentiating. So you still think like, oh, it's, um, it's bad. There's no use. It doesn't change tone. It's like you need to find that fine line where you can clearly are capable of making something better. But you choose deliberately to make things bad for delivery. Well, it's the capable thing too. Because with a lot of people who do like this, they're like, hey, I'm walking to the store. Like with a lot of sarcastic, like contrarian, like, yeah, my opinion is different. I'm sarcastic. This is, this is gay. You guys is gay. Animations are gay. Everything's gay. It's like, that's, that's a phase you grow out of because whatever that human is comes from a point of insecurity. Like there's no way if you were like, okay, I'll give you $20,000 to a guy like that, but you have to write real jokes. They wouldn't do it because they couldn't do it because it comes from a place of insecurity. It comes from a place of like, That's like the critic like mentality where it's like, this sucks. It's like you do it. You can never do it. Well, it's those people who just make like the really sarcastic like, yeah, this is, it's like, okay, write, write a real joke, write something that's like. I don't like watching critics that are mean. Like, where they're like, this sucks. It's like, why don't you just be nice about it if you're a critic? I don't like these like, the kind of critics I don't like are the one-sided critics where they always expect that there should be like, okay, so if something does something different, but there has to be like, this is the bare basics of what makes a game. You can't do anything different. You have to have, you know, good story, good, well, you know, like just like the basics of stuff. It's like that. But then they're like, these stories have to have like the build up the purpose. There needs to be a message that's told to you. There needs to be like, it has to be like by the books. This is what makes something good. And they never change their mindset. And these assholes comment on every movie and they're like, yeah, where was the resolution or stuff? And it's like, this like, you know, it's like, what do you expect? It's so weird. There's like a huge abundance of critics because anybody can be a critic. Everybody is a critic. Everybody can see what's wrong. Everybody's a critic at a point. That's not a scale. I'm becoming more like though, I'm becoming like less susceptible to how I used to be because like working on a game, you see like all these people who spend ages on games and you're like, oh man, these people make these games and release it and they probably don't get like half the attention they were hoping for. Chris, you already talked about earlier, like not the specifically dropity, but like in the cartoon world, if we, you know, if we see a cartoon that comes out of cartoon that worked for Adult Swim or Nickelodeon and I don't like it or he doesn't like it or somebody in our circle doesn't like it, is that to say that you can't say anything bad about it? You realize that a lot of... It's gonna bite you. It's gonna bite you in the ass. Not that you're afraid, but just like you're gonna hurt somebody's feelings. Yeah, you're gonna feel, you're gonna be all cool and you're gonna be like, this sucks and then they're gonna be like... This is so sucks. Then they're gonna be like, I worked on that. You're gonna be like, I feel terrible. And it feel bad because it's the same thing you were talking about. You're putting that spot where you understand where they're coming from. Yeah. Because you're working on something. Everybody's in there. Everybody is working on something. Everybody's... Whether it's music, whether it's art, whether it's like working for their fucking college degree, everybody's working on something. You know when someone's like, oh, don't go to college. It's a fucking waste of time. And it's someone you really look up to and then you're like, oh, I've just invested like $25,000 into college and now people are telling me that's a really bad idea and I'm not gonna amount to anything after it. It's like, it's hard to really fight anything because what it really comes down to is personal preference. I know for a fact now I'm gonna be more judgmental towards what I think of gaming. Like when I look at games, I'm like, man, even when a game is fucking horrible, someone had to invest time into it. It may not have been good. It may have been funny. I might have said some things when I was intoxicated and it may have been mean, but deep down, you know these people probably got paid in fucking beans and maybe like cauliflower. Nothing worth investing money in. I think the image was everybody's working on something. I think the important thing to clarify, everybody's working with what they have. Like I said, if you're like, oh, the art of this show sucks. It's like, they're probably paid like shit or they're probably listening to directors notes or producer notes. I guarantee they wanted to do something different way. People who are like, again, I have to go back to games, but you see like a million RPG maker games on, you see them on Steam. There was this one RPG maker game that I felt really bad because it looks like this person put a lot of effort into it. Like they even changed the art. You can tell they made their own art. They tried to change. They could only do what they're capable of, but they tried to their best to do it, but the person removed it because people were insulting their art. And I was like, wow, that's fucked up. It's weird when you see like something come out and you like the one thing, I mean, the main things I will criticize and not really feel bad about it is when something comes out and it's like broken or the person should have known better or just something like that where you see a movie and you just, I always noticed these producer moments where it's like a point in the movie. It's like that was clearly a producer. That's different though, because those are people who don't care. They're making it for profit. They don't give a fuck. The other thing too is what's the reality? Okay, Chris, you're working on a movie. You're getting paid a salary. That's your job. Chris, put this in. No, okay. Fire. Fire. Yeah. So we'll do it. Or like if a game comes out and it's like they throw in a feature or it's like bland now because they threw it in and it's just like, it was the producer. They wanted it to sell. Yeah. And then that completely came to like cripples the game and people are just like fuck. Like because like now they have to do it. It's scary, man. Like the real world, like these businesses, like even people who like are passionate about movies, like when Ryan was making Deadpool, like originally when he was going to play Deadpool, some fucking loony was like, let's stitch up his mouth and make him like this. It's serious because he's fighting Wolverine. It's like a really serious because you know, Deadpool is really whacking and he talks, but let's get rid of that and make it a serious brooding fight between friends. And it's like, wow, it's so tight. It's such a good idea. Let's do that. But then everyone else is like, are you fucking insane? Everyone who likes this character is going to hate it and everybody fucking hated it. And then he came out and made the character people want it and they were like, see, and then that's the case of like the producer ruining it and like people just being like, I don't want to get fired. I think it's also just the thing is the older you get, you're like 16 or something, 18 or a blast. Everybody like this guy is an asshole. Fuck this guy. Okay. Yeah, exactly. Constantly starting arguments. You're like, and then you realize it's completely pointless. Like when I was, yeah, no, I was just gonna agree with what you said. Like, you know, you're wasting your time shitting people. That's what it comes out to making your own stuff. You troll and they're like, I'm a professional troll. It's like you're also a giant faggot and you're wasting your time. I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't say that I criticized shit. That's what we're saying. We all did that. The thing is though, everybody criticized stuff. We're not all pretty angels. We all say shit. We're all like, we'll talk shit. But the second you realize that like these people come back and they talk to you and they're like, that made me upset. And you're like, oh fuck. Yeah. You're not going to be like, I felt hurt when, but if they're like, hey, that's fucked up. Why did you say that to me? And it's just like, oh fuck. No, yeah, girl, of course. These aren't people behind a computer screen. Yeah, no, it's an old story. It's like, oh, somebody, I heard somebody's feelings. It's because I, you know, we still say shit sometimes, but I'm like, wait, we pick our battles now. It's like, if you really want to start it all, give it somebody five, but they don't have to fuck up and do something. I felt really bad because I like, I don't watch Archer. I think Archer is really well written. I think it looks good and I think everything's perfectly fine about it, but I'm just not, I don't like it. I don't, I don't even know why I don't like it. It's probably the voice. Well, that's one, like, that's another thing. I love John Benjamin's voice, but it's, it's been used too much now. It's like listening to Patrick Warburton in 14 years. Exactly. And it's the same old, like, I've been listening to him since I was a little kid, like, would coach McGurk. Yeah, he's hilarious. He's my favorite, right? But anyways, what I'm saying is- It's like Bob's burgers never fit too. I never fucking understood that. I wish it was, like, he can do different voices. Like, anyway- He did that, Jason. Yeah, it was like, I didn't realize it was him. It's totally hilarious. Yeah, exactly. He's the funniest voice. Yeah. I felt bad because I just tweeted one that was like, or I said, I said it somewhere, like, I don't like air chewy, but like, it wasn't that I hate it. It's just that I don't watch it. And then a girl who worked on it was like, I love your stuff. And I was like, oh, and it hit you where it hurts. I worked on it, but it's okay. I don't even hate it. I don't even hate it. I just don't watch it. I'm just not into it. You know, and I totally understand it. And it's the same way with, like, when this guy posted this thing on the subreddit, he posted it. He's like, what do you guys think of this? And I had a one word response. I just said it was awful. But he commented and I felt like he was trying to defend it. And I'm like, oh God, I'm creating a worse problem. And then he made another post where he wanted to explain bad humor. And then he told me that the guy made another channel. I'm like, dude, stop. It's like, I don't want to hurt this guy's feelings that I want it to be any worse than it is, but this, I am not the target target audience for this shit. I'm not going to go to fucking like somebody like, you know, he does what he does, but I'm not going to go to like fucking PewDiePie or Marky Mark and be like, hey, um, this sucks because I don't enjoy it. And it's definitely not for me. I don't want to be that ass. That's another thing I was talking to you about this video years ago, like we were all younger, like I would get mad about stuff that wasn't even talking to me. Like I used to be like, fuck PewDiePie, man. Yeah. PewDiePie's like the nicest guy ever. He's just doing his fucking thing. Like it doesn't, that's what wasted energy. When you were a 17 year old kid and you're like, you're like, okay, 16 to 17 or 18. 16 to like 20 something. Yeah. You know what? I think I grew out of that like a year or two ago where I was like, I think 21, 22 is what you kind of fall into. When I was like 18 or 16 through 22, I was like, fuck everything. So gay. And then you just grow up and you're like, oh, it's not. Oh, we're all adults trying to do our old thing. It's like what, what, he gives up his house and his car and his nice life. Why? Because you don't like him? Because you think it's gay? Yeah. It's like, yeah. Like when you're a kid, you don't realize how much shit you need to save up for or what you're going wrong. You realize how hard life is. Like if your fucking mom can get cancer and you could like imagine if you had enough money to save that, you'd do it. What's the other thing? He's like, what is, he's not hurting you. Pewdiepie is nice. He's a nice guy. There's no reason. You know what I mean? It's like, it's funny because there was so much hate for him back then, even whenever that everyone was jumping on the Pewdiepie hate train, I was just like, I, to myself, I'm like, what? The dude just like makes. He just sticks to himself. He's clearly not for these fucking 30 plus adult guys, which are like, I just don't understand it. And like a retro prey, they made that video. And at the time I'm like, oh man, finally someone said it. And then I, I, like, you know, you think later and you're like, wait, what? There's people who are sitting there like doing the exact same thing he's doing and I've been doing it for years. This also sounds kind of hypocritical because we've like shit on let's play. We totally have. That's what I said. I'm not defending like, oh, I'm not going to fucking defend what I've said, but it's also like you come to the realization that like, it hits you. I'm not nowadays. Like there are people I cannot fucking stand. I mute them and get rid of them permanently. Yeah. We're trying to, we're trying to say that was moral hypocritical pieces. Shit. Yeah, exactly. I'm definitely a hypocrite. I made fun of kids who just painted over Sonic X screenshots and I probably pushed some of them. There's just pure toxic negativity where you're like, fuck this, fuck this, fuck this. I know better. It's the know you don't. I remember being like not as nice as it could be to people online. But it's just the way you are. Like it would not also not say we're fucking saints or anything. Now I did, but you say like, I'm just, I do, I do feel bad. I don't like, like I said, you realize to pick your battles. It's like, if we're back, we'd be like, fuck this, you, fuck this, new ground, you're fucked this guy. If you see my flash progression on fucking new grounds, it goes from me to rain a chance to an actual cartoon. You're 16 year old in a group on new grounds. All you do is just look at fucking cartoons and say how shitty they are. Yeah. Like I don't think I've ever wasted like maybe five minutes of my day looking at a cartoon and being like garbage spam. He's literally like, just think I was the hottest shit. I mean, the only thing that really bothers me now is like if somebody's actively being a dick on like in the community, like they're actively being pieces of shit. Like they have to really do something for me to be like, to feel like I need to say something or they're like covering their tracks, covering their tracks to make it seem like they're not the victim. Yeah, you get a lot of those people who will say some stuff and then lie behind. You know, just kidding. But then they'll say it again. Like I also, I still sweep you while I said I didn't respect before. I still respect like seven four. I don't respect. I don't respect. I just give a shit about a series. But I hate me all the way to accept this perspective on that as weird as that sounds. First time talking talented. No, he did. Dude, look, the guy's a really good singer. He thought it was really funny. Oh, he's a fantastic singer, but he cannot write up. I'll stand by this and say he cannot write a movie. Yeah, no, Ted wanted to. Plus a million ways to really ways is broken the West. Yeah, man, family guy was my favorite cartoon. Then we got had some man, man, like the old season, so some brilliant stuff. It was brilliant. So good. Yes, it was. It's like when Stewie was like not this one joke. He was like he was the one, but he was also kind of like entertaining because you never see that. It was a unique idea at the time. Yeah. But yeah, that's the thing. Like it's like it's kind of something I wanted to talk upon because and also this is something I also want to talk about. Sounds like a Pokemon. What? Yeah, this is something I also want to address like clarity for stuff. Lair. Like people seem to think that you know, you're the thing you did. Genesis or whatever. Yeah. Well, it's like people like would try to compare that to that one guy who was made fun of Tommy. Yeah. If you made fun of Tommy, yeah, they would say it's the same thing. But here's the thing. It's really not because this is a like this is like a fucking like war avatar, like fucking something straight out of League of Legends like looking guy. And the other guy is an actual human being with real feelings and stuff, not just some avatar. I mean, if people like go on YouTube and say, man, whoever Genesis is you must be some faggots like I don't think that's cool. Here's the big difference. Here's the biggest difference of all. The biggest problem in the headboard is H3 and everything and everything. That's not a huge thing, but you think. But between all these people are trying to get black and white. Yeah, exactly. The world is not black and white. Nothing is black and white. But so my point is if you're going to sit there and say it's like saying that episode of all we saw you where they have the implication scene. It's actually that's the same thing as going to some other rape victims. So you were raped. You were raped. Yeah, you can say they're both jokes, but they're different. They both evolved right. You're a fucking hypocrite. No, they're different. This this is like the equivalence of yeah, exactly. It's like anybody can like make an act. There's this guy. His name is like Kyle. He does these like interviews. He's he's big on Saturday Night Live. Is that a call? Yeah, exactly. I don't know his fucking name is weird, but I know his name is Kyle. But he goes to these public things and he like state rules it up. Like he goes in there and he just completely makes it ask himself and he looks like a skittish wreck and he goes up these people. He's like, how do you do? You're hilarious. And then people are baseball. Yeah, people don't understand. They're just like, are you crazy? Get out of my face. Like they think he's actually mental, but he's an actor. And it's like there's people who are completely capable of going online and pretending to be something they're not. You can't just say, oh, because of how he's talking is like that. I could go on fucking second life right now and pretend to be crazy. I don't even I don't even like I don't think it's that. I think it's also like nuance in humanity and like, yeah. But it's like you. Yeah, exactly. It's like, I think I want to sympathize with somebody who legitimately is real. And I can touch with my finger at one point in my life than somebody who is just this on this as a being that I know. Maybe to those like, so for example, Chris, if you if you made a video, if you made that video, you were like you positively like, look at this fucking retarded, so fucking stupid, what an autistic fucking faggot guys, right, guys? Yeah, that's definitely going to let the guy talk. The guy was being funny. I genuinely I would love to fucking hang with him. He was saying funny stuff. It felt more like I just I'm never going to go up to be like, dude, what the fuck? To me, I said I said this, but it felt more like something where it felt like you were role playing like you were in a larking situation where you would go up to a guy who's like, how many words have you won? And he's like too many to count. You just kind of like sat and listened. Yeah. But in the other line, you're like talking to like a cousin's kid. You're like, I don't know what to do. Like you because you want to keep it like as you're interested. So you're trying to keep it going. You're just like, OK, this is like in sometimes and let me let me be frank. It's like Chris definitely edited stuff. He's not going to keep things of him like of hearing horrible stories. And then like, you know, yeah, yeah, he's not going to. He's not going to include the horrible stuff that Genesis said. He's going to keep it professional and not try to fucking like, like I said, the difference you could take the same subject who has disabilities or who is autistic or whatever, and you can you can make different types of videos with that. It's not the subject who matters. Like you didn't sick all of your fans after the guy said, hey, guys, here's this channel. Here's where you can find him. Try and like, that's what I'm saying. I tried to add on. I'm just saying that. They look like the guy got trouble because he linked the guy's channel name was like, Terry, this guy's an idiot. He's so crazy. Look at his fucking the door. Well, the problem is he's going to other videos of his. Those people were like, man, that's me. If you just told people like that, I was like, look at the other fucking second line videos on YouTube. There's people who go on people's second line and they're like, whoa, hey, pork chop. And then they show pictures of the girl. It's like, it's just like it. Like I said, it's a rape joke. You cannot say a good rape joke is the same thing is making a bad rape joke and a victim saying you should be with. They're different. Yeah, they're both rape, but you can make completely. It's comedy. It's context. It's intent. What you said about black and white is like, I find myself in nearly every situation in my day to day life where I'm like, this is a gray area. That's what I'm saying. Like if I say something about a game, like if I was to stream a game and like I said, like it's like, oh, you are just you are saying shit about the game, but you're making a game. So you're a hypocrite and it's like, shit about the game. Yeah. And it's just. It just rolls off the tongue. It's like, it's like an ABGN moment. Just like, shit about the game. Just like stop and say it for some minutes. I heard the railing back. No, it's fine. But it's like now it's like, I feel like I can't say anything. Like if I say anything, I'll be like stepping on someone's feet. But even then, in a sense, like I don't care, but I like to try to explain myself without seeming like, oh, it's just buttery. You shouldn't explain yourself. It's like, you can't even do that because you always look like you're trying to defend yourself. And it's just like, you can't just. What I learned is people, the world, we live in the world. And that's like, oh, it's like this generation, but we live that we live in the world of sound bites. We live in the world of like the first thing you say is what people grab on to. And so it's like, well, I didn't like this movie. And then you go, but well, this part, they go, no, you said you like it. You don't like it. You know, it's a good part. Like you can't elaborate anything now without it's a minefield. Now, if you if you elaborate or like, you know, explain yourself, people assume you're back peddling or like you said, defending yourself. That's why people like Stephen Fry fucking bail from Twitter. And they're just like, this is stupid. Because we live in the world of like 160 characters. Stephen Fry. He's not like nice British dude. He's very anti PC. So people run him off of Twitter and he was like, this is really stupid. He's I think he's who is boring. Yeah, it's not fun. Yeah, it is boring. And it's like, here's another thing I don't understand. I think I might have said this, but I don't understand like people who like after a while, you're kind of into it. But then you get in like this weird thing where it's like, if stuff actually starts bothering you, then you should probably make an effort not to invest time into like looking at you. You should put yourself where you're happy and not surrounded by negative energy. Like there's a guy I'm not I'm not I'm not trying to call him out. I did. I do like his video. I watch his video. It's time to time. It's Zach. Zach O'Reilly over here. No, it's I think his his name's like Sargon, the Argonaut or some. I don't know his fucking name, but he he makes entertaining videos. But but he does these things where he's like this week in stupid, where every week he's bombarded with just gay, stupid feminist shit. Just like the worst human beings on the fucking internet currently. They're just so desensitized. They're just assholes. It would be like it's like here. Here's more toxicity. Do you want it? You want it? And then he takes it and then he does these videos and it's just like, I don't know what goes to his head. Like if he's like contemplating like because there has to be some like mental anguish where he's like, you know, he probably enjoys the topic, but he also probably like another area. It's like if someone like Anita, Sir Keesey and like scams fans or just acts like a kind of right, are you doing a good thing by warning people or are you adding fuel to the fire? That's it. It's like a double edged sword. It's like nobody wins in that case because you don't want Anita to get the attention she's hoping for. It's not even the attention. It's the I'd be attacked. I'm a woman. Yeah. Yeah. So you wanted to you want to explain yourself, but then that just creates more people who also want to explain their self. And it's just it's like it's it's like a tumbling. You get in the scheme of constantly explaining and debating and debating and constantly explaining. Yeah. Just find dialogue is good, but people don't want dialogue. They want like I said, they want like they want something to grab onto. That's short and edible. Yeah. And I think that's pretty much what's dissolving into everything nowadays. Like nowadays I try to avoid most feminist stuff because I don't want to hear it anymore. Yeah. I just always run into it somehow. Yeah. So I feel like completely like my Twitter, I've just followed nothing but Japanese accounts. So like now my feed is just nothing but Japanese like porn and just accounts. Like just I don't even understand it. One sometimes I'll see like you make a post or I'll see Zach make a post because then I'll be like, oh, this is what's going on in the election. And then I'll see you make a post about something and I'll be like, wait, now there's just more Japanese stuff. And it's just like then it's like so I have it like filtering out fucking everything. I set my location to Japan so I only get cookies and like the food network and stuff in Japan. That's really good idea. That's all it is, man. You know what Japanese people post all day, every day forever. Fucking food. Food and porn. That's all they fucking post. They're like, this is what I'm eating tonight. This is what I'm drawing going to bed. This is what I'm eating tomorrow. This is what I'm drawing tonight. I'm going to bed. And it's just like, this is the perfect lifestyle. You didn't show me how to do that. Dude, this is like, well, actually the accounts I follow are probably in question. I have a few accounts, but if you see an account like that just, they post art. Follow that because it's much like it's a much nicer environment to come on Twitter. I don't follow anyone except for my friends. Yeah, I ended up kind of waiting out the people who like, like there's also Japanese people who post like 50 posts a day. You know what, you know, you gotta be muted. You post too much. Let's stop. OK, so we've had a lot of really goofy topics.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:16.950 --> 0:18:17.271]:

  Really is so good.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:29.309 --> 0:30:31.317]: 
  I was going to address. Talk about it as if it's a Pokemon.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:30:48.529 --> 0:30:49.845]: 
  Yeah. Leave a few minutes for the time. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:09.994 --> 0:31:12.070]: 
  Yeah, but here's the...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:31:21.672 --> 0:31:22.583]: 
  Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:23.477 --> 0:31:25.232]: 
  Nothing is like a way.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:30.818 --> 0:31:31.307]:

Yeah, how long does it take you to actually start streaming from a real stream? This is what you do you open up x split you wait fucking two minutes for it to start up because it's a slow piece of shit Yeah, I use OBS. I use OBS. OBS is cool I like x split because it records as an MP4 while you do it. Dude, their fucking database got hacked like a few years ago Oh, well, I don't know. It's like streaming. It's like it always takes me so long And I mean my computer blue screens whenever I'm halfway through a stream anyway, so it's not even get a full stream in Yeah, it takes like two minutes for OBS or x with the start then you got to go on twitch alerts That screen screened into OBS if you haven't saved it I usually have to do it from scratch because it never like remembers what I can't even fucking do that shit I'm like people are telling me I'm like I set up a stream and I'm okay I need to do a thing and then it's like 90 to twitch alerts and I'm like I can't I gotta make sure that everything on one desktop is moved to the other and I gotta make sure that Skype is signed out And I gotta make sure that all the When I was one is closed well, I even that what do you save as a file doesn't go to like fucking Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll file first.

  Yeah, both yeah, and you also got to make sure the the audio is good Yeah, gotta make sure gonna make sure I close out of all the pictures I save off Google so I have to be like exit out of exit because if I accidentally click I usually gotta make sure that my recent save files are all wiped so talk about yeah So like it even if you go to like file it might be like recent files like big dick. It's like oh, oh Jesus Christ There's so much stuff. It's so funny. Hold that you pig. I will say that I like streaming very rarely I don't like doing it all the time. I use it as kind of like a Motivational thing like I feel like when I have an audience watching me I feel like I'm kind of forced to focus on my thing But then I get to that weird position where I kind of zone out. I'm like, okay. I'm no longer need you guys I'd like to do it more but it just sucks the energy out of me

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:22.540 --> 0:41:24.413]: 
  Yeah. Gotta make sure. Gotta make sure.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:29.357 --> 0:41:30.235]: 
  I usually got to make sure

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:32.445 --> 0:41:33.829]: 
  You're sort of talking about, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:40.647 --> 0:41:42.435]: 
  Big, tiny hole, don't you think?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:57.539 --> 0:41:58.180]: 
  I do more.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:59.479 --> 0:42:01.504]: 
  I do, it's a little bit...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:01.504 --> 0:43:13.999]: 
  That's why you guys have some video. You need somebody. You need... I've been doing it by my own and I don't know if I can do that now. Maybe it depends on the game I play. I was thinking of playing a bunch of fucking visual novels. I think it's impressive if you can fucking keep a stream going for more than two hours. Two hours is what I think is the cap. It's your charisma. Like there's that guy, there's only one other streamer I watch. There's two streamers. I watch Northern Lion and I watch Vinny. I watch his streams. But I don't watch him on... I kind of watch his full-size. I can't watch his fucking stream, but he has so much charisma. And he can entertain for fucking hours. And he's so laid back. And it's just like... you can just listen and join out to him. Do you know Elizabeth? Elizabeth. She's like this big streamer. She just does it all day, every day. She just keeps doing it. I don't understand. It's impressive. I mean, I guess when I'm animating, I can stream for like five hours straight when I'm animating. Maybe even longer. I've streamed for like 14 hours before. I can't do it. I just can't. When you're animating, dude, you're just like completely... You get your own. I mean, you have to have somebody in the thing with you. Like, you can do these things with your computer. Consider doing the Lexi to have her kind of in there. Yeah, I was thinking about doing it. It makes it a lot easier. I need somebody out. Like, get put under pressure. I wanted to have you a few times. I'll be on yours if you're on mine. I would do yours. I'll just sit out of it because I didn't get invited. You're always welcome to mine.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:10.853 --> 0:42:11.815]: 
  I think it's a prank.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:15.173 --> 0:42:15.831]: 
  Two hours of like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:24.809 --> 0:42:25.349]: 
  But I don't want to.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:33.246 --> 0:42:33.499]: 
  I know that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:33.499 --> 0:42:33.955]: 
  and he's

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:51.555 --> 0:42:53.597]: 
  I can't do it. I just can't.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:54.812 --> 0:42:55.943]: 
  So it's on.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:55.943 --> 0:42:56.567]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:01.005 --> 0:43:02.811]: 
  Yeah, I was thinking about doing it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:07.992 --> 0:43:09.342]: 
  I would do yours.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:11.586 --> 0:43:12.919]: 
  You're always watching.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:12.447 --> 0:43:13.004]: 
  You're always welcome.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:13.729 --> 0:43:18.269]: 
  Because I have all of you every time you're like, sorry. That's the thing, right? You're always welcome to mine. I'll do it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:15.214 --> 0:44:39.910]: 
  That's the thing right you're always welcome to mind I'll do a stream as long as I hadn't streamed as well that day and nearly every time you asked me I've already streamed that day Chris. I'm always just like You're always welcome to stream with me I'll have to bother you though But I don't want to keep bothering you everything because I might stream randomly They don't bother me there. It's always fun to do you feel like have somebody else in the stream Let us engage with the chat more you know, I have a lot of like moments But how do people feel about other people because there's like this weird thing where some people like I'm kind of the same way or where I'm So used to listening to a certain person that the second someone else comes in. I'm like I kind of can't listen anymore That's why you gotta build up consistency. I'm gonna do it with Nikki for like so much Yeah, people get surprised when I don't do it. Oh, I see it. Yeah, I mean, that's a lot like um with a northern lion Like I watch him and he streams I actually watch it. He's usually else. He's he's streamed for these four guys He seems like it's a boy. Yeah, it's just about consistency keeping an arm. You know, absolutely There's just one guy he always streams with so he always streams with him So every time I hear his voice, I know he's in it. There's some extra people, but I know he's always in it So it's just consistency people like to leave your voices. We should just do more sleepy cabin streams We should I'd be totally down and just sit and by the way sleepy cabin has a twitch It's sleepy.

We have to edit these They're like racist Horrible lesson we did I was fun. We gotta do more. We gotta do more was just unfiltered like just unbridled It's good. I think students are fun because you get like regularity people like oh, it's like a saloon That's what I mean here comes so it's all waterly in I try to stream at least once every weekend Before you say that can I say one thing? Yeah for the last podcast we uploaded we talked about Religion and stuff and we made black jokes. Oh, yeah, and I just wanted to say it's like during the podcast I apologize for making the black jokes and people got mad at me for apologizing Oh, I just wanted to say that you have to or people will use it against you You know look it's just this is a comedy podcast man. No, I know it's like it's not I'm saying it's like no, I know what I'm saying is that there's people who take it out of context Oh, probably just a better idea to do that. I know you shouldn't have to sense yourself I'm not so the thing is though if somebody wants to get mad at you even if you apologize They can still take it out like every for this closure if you're listening everything we said over the last two seasons has been Yes, but if we say something terrible about child molestation or racism, it's not we don't really think that See see see what you're saying right now is what I did Apologize I was just saying that that's what we're doing But people got mad at me for doing that It's weird too because like this may sound like kind of like out of like left field But I was actually watching some really old rooster-teeth stuff. Yeah, really old like I was watching some Jeff and Jack do stuff And Jeff he would like pull up not Jeff Jeff, but I would say G off because I'm retarded. I can't read I see you off Yeah, I can't read it how it's but but he was reading off stuff Like I think he said something about fucking like Hiroshima, but it was so perfect It sounded like something we would fucking say but he was saying like I think he was he was like So something like did you hear that screams? It's like yeah It's like the the Japanese people trapped in the ships in Hiroshima or something. I was like whoa dude But in a way you tried to you go I legitimately like set up and I'm like did I just hear that That's funny cuz it comes in a nowhere. Yeah, why would you jump to that?

It's like there's just some unbridled stuff where it's like people laugh Everyone understood. Okay, you know yes, okay people dying is bad And big disasters are bad, but you also have to understand that we're laughing because it's like a joke It's like we're at the expense of it being bad We know that like the coal mine was a bad thing, but it's also a very easy joke Why I think this would be agree with it. Yeah like holy fuck by that logic like books money getting hit on the head with a Hammer is like really fucked up because the guy's got his head caved in with a hammer Yeah, but it's just like yeah, I can't get it here.

That's a kid. There's 14 of them all around the cauldron. He clapped me to spell. He... he... He circles into 14 smaller bridges. They all scatter around. So they're all looking up at the cauldron dancing. They're trying to find you. They're trying to find me looking at a cauldron dancing. Yes. They're creating a human ladder. Well, luckily for me, if they're all facing a cauldron... Oh, wait. Yeah, if they're all facing a cauldron, no matter where I am behind them, they won't see me. They'll see you. In the reflection. Yes. Okay. They say another dog for our stew. They grow into one log. Okay, okay. I got this. I bark. I bark.

  Luckily for me if they're all facing a call away

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:29.744 --> 0:52:29.811]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:32.174 --> 0:52:32.663]:

  Just looking around licking their lips, curiously.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:18.233 --> 0:54:20.646]: 
  curiously.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:20.359 --> 1:02:11.155]: 
  Um, Zach's gonna go pee. I carry him, I hold a big rock and fall off a cliff. Or you hold me by- Fall to my death. You're like, no Cory, I'm like- That's the sacrifice I need as an escape. I am freak and then my fucking head explodes against the rock as I fall into the ocean. Dead. The goddess of the ocean pulls you into the sea with her god hand. What's that saying? The ending is this. Oh no. Cory, you crawl back into the cauldron, it's a steep- It's a nice- It's too early to splatter my fucking brains out of rock. There's a lot of rocks. There's a lot of rocks at the bottom of the cliff ocean. Yeah, but you forget the ending where you crawl back into the cauldron, it's a nice- It's a nice height of temperature, you say, now that's a dog day. It's the hot tub time machine movie. You go back in time to the- To the hot tub time machine, to the inception of it. You abolish slavery. I abolish- I do the right thing. Cory, you wake up, you John F. Kennedy. I was about- I was about to say, I wake up from the back of JFK's car, that's what I was about to fucking say. You said it. Cory, you wake up, you are in John F. Kennedy's body. Yeah. It's 1963 Dallas, you're about to turn the corner. I was in the middle of singing. Lollipop, lollipop, lollipop. Lollipop, lollipop, lollipop. Hey, have you ever seen the video, the alternate shot of JFK, where he gets shot in the head and that like flap on top of his head flies over and a will of the wisp flies over his head? Did you see the conspiracy theories, where they talk about how the bullet is like, it can like curve and like go through trees? That was the will of the wisp. Is it the continent of the will of the wisp? That's the will of the will of the will of the wisp. The will of the wisp is a fucking Scottish ghoul. I'm JFK, so instead of my head being fucking splattered. When you do Cory, Jackie's like, oh yeah, Johnnie, yeah. She just like licked her thumb and rubbed it on his head and slapped his head back down. I do this, Cory, Cory, she's like Cory. Right then and there I go, the bullet flies past me. No, Cory, she's like- I get out of the car and I'm no longer JFK's body, it's like a looper, I disappear. The floor before it happened, she's like, Jackie, Kelly, slobber, she's like, what, really, what? Well, she said stick it in your fucking ear and slap it on the side of the head. The weird thing about that video is- Fucking backhander, her fucking teeth come out. The weird thing is, it's like he almost even doesn't try and dodge the bullet. No, you know the real story behind that? The real story, though, it's actually really interesting. So he hears a first shot go off and he looks around, and then he gets shot in the throat the first time. Oh, he's like, what was that? He holds his hands up to his throat, but he couldn't bend over because he was wearing a back brace. JFK wore a back brace because his back was so shitty. If he got shot in the throat, it would not- He probably would have lived, because he got shot in the throat, but he didn't get shot in the spine, obviously. He probably could have lived. But blood and fucking particles would have flown all over. He had a chance of living, at least. Yeah, but his fucking head exploded. So, but it's interesting, if he didn't have a back brace, he could have leaned forward. My Irish teacher used to be like, have you ever seen the autopsy of JFK? And he'd be like, if you notice here, the bullet curved here. Did that curve? Yeah, I know. Everyone was like, you're fucking retarded. The biggest misconception is that if you look at the car, like the reason I say curve is because it hit the guy in front of him, the governor. Right in front of JFK, it hit him in the back. But they're all like, wait, it hit drive Kennedy in the throat, but it also hit this guy in the arm and it's no sense. It had to curve him in the air. Wasn't the guy- wasn't he in a moving car? No, that's not even the thing though. The governor was sitting like six inches to the left and also six inches higher than him. He was truly like that. His back was like, he was looking backwards. My- His perfect sense, literally. Yeah, the Irish teacher was also like, one time the Pope got shot and the bullet curved around all his vital organs. This is like, no. Is it the same guy who said that the fucking son like fell in the sky? Yeah, you know, he said the son danced in the sky because- This made the retard, he flipped the heat. He said it danced in the sky in like the thirties when cameras were around. How does he dance in the sky? He danced in the sky and gravity was as effective as- How does the son dance? He used to tell the story like this, used to be like, one time there were many people all at a big gathering and like he was pretty much said- He sounds like a caveman. He had this booming Irish voice, he's like, his name was actually Mr. O'Neill. Did you see his furrow, bro? He had like- Did he hear a bode class and fucks like, eat gazelles? He's the same asshole who made me like, he made me write 25 pages of I must not get my question wrong or whatever. You should have told him like, you should have told him that like dancing, the dancing and the son was a lie. No, he, no, but he said like, Christians knew that the son was going to dance on this day. And, and like nobody believed him. But then, when everybody was looking up in the sky, the son began to dance towards in a way- What does dance mean? Nobody fucking knew the colors. And like he's the brain of a three-year-old and he thinks the son has no gravitational impact on the source. Is he talking about when you look at this son? Why does he- He thought that the son would like, not be caught on camera. I love how he doesn't understand the son move like, I believe I was closer to fucking Earth with like a Vaporate. My fucking dipshit fucking question was like, how come no one caught this on camera? And he's like, because they all believed and they all knew it was true so they didn't have news. Fuck you. That's such a bad cop. Why did God make the son dance on the Earth in 2016? Yeah, how come God didn't fucking make the Earth dance? How come there's no talk of the Earth dancing around God's green earth? I don't know. Why does God walk on the Earth as a real example of the face? If there was a God, it would be way cooler if he just walked around like a big God. Like- I've only said, why did the Bible add material and put it on Earth like a big monument, making material that exists in no one else in the universe? You know what I think got the closest feeling of seeing a God I've ever seen in my life? See me? No. There's this game on Windows 98, I think it's called Planescape. Can you hear that? It's like a Dungeons & Dragons game. I'm really curious where the fuck you're going with it. It's really cool, right? So there's this character in the game called the Lady of Pain, where she like watches over like this one specific dimension or something. But in the game, she just randomly walks around and everyone in the game is like, don't go near her. Like if you even look at her, she'll kill you. And that's what I would feel like a God would do. Because in the game, if you like fuck with her, she just instantly kills you and there's nothing you can do. Whoa. It's cool. She's scary. That's just scary in general. The representation that's scary, you just want to walk and fuck with her. The Lady of Pain, you should look it up. It's like the coolest idea for a character ever. That's a good idea. She like knows how to open portals and shit, so she just locked herself into this dimension and she just lets people live in her town. But nobody like fucks with her. Anyways. How long have you been recording for? We'll go for like 10 more. You talked about the anime. It would be interesting to live in like a thousand, two thousand years ago and they really believed in the Xuzin stuff. Because they really believed that. They have no idea how the world works. Imagine how magical the world felt to live in. Yeah, every little thing. Imagine if there was no science. You really believed that. You feel people really believed like those. Yeah, if like it was raining, you'd be like, oh, the sky is sad. The sky god is sad. Seeing a tornado would just blow your mind. Or like an eclipse. But you would see that. You'd be like, oh, they must be angry with how we've been doing, like what we've been doing. From a human perspective, it must have been so crazy to have those kind of feelings stirred up to really believe. That fucking movie. You saw like a mermaid or something. That fucking movie, Apocalypse. I've found my eyes to be playing tricks on me recently. What do you mean? Like today I saw, like I was walking by a bush and I thought I saw a squirrel run up right next to my face. And I turned around and it was just a bird. It's called schizophrenia. Probably is. You get it in 25. I visualized a squirrel, but it was a bird. That's what schizophrenia is. Oh god, here goes. Luckily Chris, you only get at age 25. That's good. I'm 25. The last night, I didn't talk about it before. I'll keep it quick, but I had these things constantly. I had it like two nights ago. We're all wake up and I'll see something in the room or like wake up at night to be scared of something. Like I woke up and I had this big fucking coil of snake in my chair. I was like, ah, it's good to fuck out of me. That's really weird. You're still dreaming. You're like coming out of your dream while you're awake. Yeah, exactly. And I was walking the hallway to the bathroom. I saw like a little boy standing there and I almost screamed. I was just a little boy you kidding at. Yeah, he actually had to grab him and throw him back in the bathroom. He threw him down the stairs so he slept again. I saw him like peel it up. I opened my window like three days ago and I walked in there and I couldn't find Django. I was like, oh God, I thought he jumped out the window. He was like, what do you think? Like if a caveman saw the aurora borealis, what's he thinking? What's an aurora borealis? The fucking light show in the sky that you see in the North Pole. You see the phenomenon of like the air or siren? The what? You haven't seen this before. I don't believe you when I talk about this. It happened in New York. I was in New York a few months ago. We were at John's office and we were like, oh, I'm sorry.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:27.919 --> 0:54:29.134]: 
  That's the sacrifice I needed.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:46.549 --> 0:54:49.030]: 
  Two airs splattered with fucking brains that are rotten.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:50.768 --> 0:54:51.291]:
