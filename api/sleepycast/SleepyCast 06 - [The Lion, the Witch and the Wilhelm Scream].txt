  How did you write that down? How are you even reading that? I wrote that in like my own symbols. Yeah, it's your real language. How did you know my language? It shows your face with a dick coming in and doing the stand-up walking in and you putting the book away. How are you reading that? I was savant. Okay. Yeah, an idiot savant. No, a cool one with a big dick and a cool, fast car. Count these toothpicks, bitch. A big, fast dick, fast car savant. Big, fast dick car. Okay. Anyways. Let's talk about dead animals. Okay. All right. Remember, obviously, we're gonna sell like assholes, but you know, kids are young. They don't really have a concept of life and death. Did you ever do anything when you were younger where you heard an animal, like maybe an insect? Here we go. You ready? Yeah. I didn't do it, but you wanna hear a sad story? Yeah. One time after school, I was waiting to get picked up and my friend Kevin was standing around and he saw a little caterpillar on the ground and he was like, watch this. And he picked it up and he got a pencil and he poked out the caterpillar's eye with it. And I felt really, really sad. He poked out his eye? It's terrible. Yeah, I know, it wasn't fun. Sorry, I'm after a bum and I had the podcast already, but it did happen. You know what? I'm gonna beep out his name too. Well, he's lucky to care. Kevin, you're a fucking monster. Yeah, it was, no, he's a nice guy now, but that was like the saddest thing I ever saw, the end. I shot a seagull once. I felt really horrible about that. You shot a seagull? Seagull's worthless though. Yeah, we had this, this is, I don't even know if you could do it anymore, but we used to be able to go to Walmart and buy, like, BB guns. Like, BB guns? You could still do that, yeah, you could still, you could buy pellet guns. But like the ones that you put the cartridge, the CO2 cartridge in that like, you could really do damage with it. You could buy shotguns, like shotguns, but you could buy like actual guns at Walmart. We had, man, we got into so much fucking trouble with that gun, there was three times that we got in the, cause it looks real, first of all. The first time we got into trouble with it is cause I was in the car with my friend Polo, and he's sitting in the passenger seat, and there's a minivan in front of us, and there's like these two grade school kids in the back window, like making fun of us, and he's like, man, fuck those bitches. And I was like, dude, they're just kids. And he's like, no, fuck them. And then he pulls the gun out, and then he's like, he's like, point it at them. And then they went ape shit, and you could see him silently going nuts in the car, right? And then I get up, and he's like, ah, that was so funny. And then I get up to the light, and then the van like stopped all the way behind me, right? And then I went over to Polo's house. It turns out that she held back there to get my license plate. And then my dad called my cell phone, and he's like, son, get home right fucking now. And I was like, what? And then me and Polo went back to my dad's house, and there was cops all over the place. Like several? Yeah, and then they interviewed us separately, and they interviewed him first, and they were like, and then he came out, and he was like, don't tell him fucking anything. And I was like, yeah, man, I got you back. And then I went in there, and I was like, it's a fake gun. We got it at Walmart, and we already got rid of it. Actually, that was the last story. That was when I actually disposed of it in a pond, like I was in fucking... Like you just killed somebody? Yeah, I was like, I gotta get rid of this thing. It's a toy gun from fucking Walmart. But as far as the animal story goes, like again, we were sitting in the car. It was always in my car, and it's like, hey, see if you can't shoot that seagull. And I was like, okay, and then I just did it. And it got him right through the neck, and he was like, eh! And then he just, he plopped over like a bag of shit. I felt so fucking horrible. I got out of my car, went over to the seagull, and I picked him up. I picked up his lifeless little body. And it's so weird because their necks in real life are only like two inches long. Well, not when they're dead, but when I picked up his body, his head dangled, and his neck stretched out like a spaghetti noodle. And his neck was like a foot long. And then I ran to the veterinarian. I was like, fixed the bird. And the whole time, his head was like flopping like a slinky. And then I passed it over to the vet, and the vet was like, what do you want me to do with this? I was like, I don't know, can you fix it? And she's like, it's dead. I'll see what I can do. And I know she just took it to the back and threw it in the trash. I threw it in the trash. But I felt so horrible after doing that. It's a trash can. Oh, God. He was like dangling around. That gun was so fucking powerful, though. The third of those stories was, I was with my friend, it's not like it fucking matters. But he was like, give me that. He got the gun and then he pointed it, as we were driving by, he pointed it at the back of an SUV and he shot the window. Is this the same guy? No, this is a different guy. This is Antoine. So he pointed it at the back of the SUV and he cracked off one shot and the window turned to, it just crumbled. I've never seen anything like that before.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:59.599 --> 0:04:00.207]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:18.820 --> 0:04:20.254]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:55.658 --> 0:04:57.413]: 
  I felt really, really sad.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:56.114 --> 0:04:56.940]: 
  looking really, really trivial.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:15.773 --> 0:05:16.161]: 
  Um

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:34.217 --> 0:05:35.112]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:04.414 --> 0:07:04.920]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:18.563 --> 0:08:20.504]: 
  Oh god.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:20.504 --> 0:08:20.892]: 
  That guy.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:49.022 --> 0:08:52.094]: 
  I've never seen anything like that before. This is a movie card, it's a park card.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:51.722 --> 0:10:42.540]: 
  No, just a parked car. It didn't pop a little hole in it. The entire thing exploded into powder. Yeah, the whole back window broke into little chunks, like no bigger than... I want to say like grains of rice is what it looked like, but the whole thing just crumbled into... I guess it's like a preventative measure, so if you wreck your car... Or so it's a piece of glass? Yeah, so if you bust a window and break into a car, like for the most part you could touch the glass because it crumbles. They're not like window shards that cut you. It's not like a window glass or door glass or something. Whenever you see videos online of people like smashing into windows, that's always what happens. It always turns into little individual grains. Yeah, like little pieces of grain. It was so weird. I would love to see a slow motion of like the... Window smashing? Ruin that guy's fucking day. Chris, what about you? Those guns have to be illegal now, dude. I swear you could really do some damage. You could buy real guns at Walmart. You can. Like real guns. See, this was in Virginia. Like in, I don't know, in like Colorado, you used to be able to go in there and get shotguns. I'm pretty sure you could get rifles or something like that now. You could run into, yeah, in the Midwest especially, you could run in there and pick up like a... You'd been 10 minutes, you could walk out of there with a gun. Yeah, kill somebody, yeah, immediately. In Virginia, I think they just sold the... I don't know, they're called like air guns or something like that. Airsoft, right? Is that airsoft? Because airsoft is pellets. Yeah, but these are like metal BBs that are like shot out of... So it's a high-powered BB gun basically. They're like a CO2 cartridge. They're like insanely powerful. Like I still... that sight of that seagull plopping over is burned into my mind. Seagull like conspires. Chris, did you hear these stories? I told you about the caterpillar, but you know... Oh, sorry, sorry. No, but no, but I had another story with the same guy. I used to go over to his house, and but one time he found like a bunch of daddy long leg spiders. They're little tiny ball bodied spiders. Yeah, but yeah. Yeah, but I remember he used to bring me over and be like, watch this. He'd like pick off all their legs and put the little balls on the table all next to each other.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:10.555 --> 0:09:12.158]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:50.007 --> 0:11:50.175]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:52.116 --> 0:11:52.589]: 
  Oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:55.997 --> 0:11:56.689]: 
 它re est boy

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:12.805 --> 0:13:28.050]: 
  Yeah, and they're loud and uh, yeah. They're fucking woodpeckers. There's just no other option. It was causing hundreds of dollars. They peck a wood all day. They're known for pissing people off. Okay, but sorry, another good story is, one time when I was younger, I was at my mom and dad's house, and there was a rat that kept eating out of their bird feeder. And the way our kitchen, like, it overlooks the bird feeder, so it's like a big-ass window bird feeder. And there was always this rat who would always climb up it and start gnawing out of it. And one time my dad, like, took his head out of the window and started, like, shaking his fist at the rat and being like, get off of it! And then the rat would look at him and be like, WAH! And he'd just keep on eating the bird feeder, right? So my mom was like, she called her brother Jimmy, and he came over with a shotgun, like, which was kind of overkill, now that I think of it, but he came over with a shotgun, and we had all my little cousins, me, my mom and dad, and all our uncles and aunts, just looking at the window at this rat eating out of a bird feeder. Well, my uncle Jimmy, like, snuck up on it with the shotgun, and he pulled the trigger, and it was just like a wave of blood erupted onto the windscreen, and everyone screamed. And that was it. I think blasting a fucking rat with his shotgun is a little extreme. No, I know, but it was really... You could have hit it with a pellet gun in the eyes, it's killing. I don't know if it was a shotgun, if it was some kind of rifle, but... You could have thrown a rock at it. It was a big old gun, and it fucking exploded. I remember when I was a kid, I had a BB gun. No, he did a... No, unless I'm saying the kitchen window overlooked like the bird feeder outside.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:16.399 --> 0:12:16.922]: 
  There was just no...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:18.593 --> 0:12:19.437]: 
  They pick a woodle-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:19.437 --> 0:12:19.892]: 
  They're no

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:09.201 --> 0:13:09.505]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:22.448 --> 0:13:22.499]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:22.499 --> 0:13:24.945]: 
  I remember when I was kid, I had a BB gun.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:28.050 --> 0:13:34.497]: 
  I had a baby guy that was a kid with time, I was probably 11 or 12. Yeah. And I love animals, but for some reason I

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:34.497 --> 0:14:04.146]: 
  I just wanted to see what happened. I shot with a BB gun and I thought it would die. It's one of those days where it's not right, but your kid just kind of was he held it you know it react Yeah, and it didn't die. I was like fuck. I felt like I was concerned hopping around Long story short to what 70 or 80 shots me to kill it did not take two or three And I kept it I kept it to go back get more babies and reload it. I was like, well, I'm down Why did you step on it? I'm not gonna step because I did I step on it You know what you're just shooting it with tiny fucking bees. What else are we gonna do kick it into the day?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:43.255 --> 0:13:43.626]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:03.269 --> 0:14:06.306]: 
  Give him a shot, gonna fucking blast this frog in the face.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:06.475 --> 0:16:15.771]: 
  My gosh, it was that still makes me sad to think about it. This is tell me what you guys have you guys ever? Hated animal with your car. What's always hit a monkey? Like something that's true a true story We because not treating it. I didn't hit a chip and zero the way to wall It's sort of screaming I kept driving all right next to the monkey crossing. Yeah. Yeah. It's a huge problem I feel like I have hit an animal with my car before nothing big enough Yeah, I don't know I don't know I've run over dead animals I was in the car with my uncle once and we hit an owl and I still remember the terrified look on the owls face when Because he flew right into the windshield and just exploded. Oh, no, you killed the best glitch the lipstick Just flew straight at the window and last thing I saw was his little owl face crushing in slow motion And then it was feathers and a big smear on the wind. I'll tell you something terrifying I saw where's that kind of grew up in the country Yes, and these dude to pick up truck he hit a deer head on in front of my house at night And we went out there and it was just this pickup truck in the middle of the road this lights on and this deer with it Wasn't even dead it had all four legs were broken and it was flailing around all four broken legs flailing in every direction This is like this is like nightmare. Yeah, this is a nightmarish like silent hill game before that Yeah, that's the first thing I thought oh like that's what you come up on in the fog in silent hill You just see Horrible like single light on this thing in the dark flailing around but it it died But the funniest part was before anybody even had a chance to pull it off the road some other dude and another pickup truck came by And he's just like hey you guys are gonna eat that You guys want that? Well still alive do is dead. It was dead and we're everybody's like no you can have it And he just grabbed it and fit through in the back and drove off cool.

It was a frog it's do okay. Yeah. Yeah, I would never though I'm not brave enough because it does have it does have a liver like a blowfish where it's like you have if you If you do the wrong part inside it poisons like a whole thing So you throw the whole thing off as a poison sack inside. That's what?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:14.335 --> 0:18:14.740]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:24.392 --> 0:18:25.455]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:29.438 --> 0:18:52.827]: 
  Now the P. Yeah, it's funny enough peeing I always hit some guys pee on the peel these dead I heard that if you wear gloves while you're handling a frog it it like Disrespects you and does a little war cry. It's true. Oh, yeah You have to skin their front legs you could eat their back legs with the skin on but you have to skin their front legs because they're like Poison dart frogs. Yeah, they're the little blue front legs. They have those little war packets with swell up with poison

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:33.792 --> 0:18:34.939]: 
  I'm gonna peel these tits.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:34.939 --> 0:18:35.867]: 
  I heard that

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:52.506 --> 0:18:59.948]: 
  When you capture it, you have to put your finger on the rest of the tongue. If you want to skin them, you know what I mean? They get frozen and feel like a cat.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:59.948 --> 0:19:11.440]: 
  Then you could skin them. Twiddle your finger around. Yeah, twi- If you bend your finger down, their mats open. Yeah, you'd see a puppet. Then you put in your wiener. You could if you wanted to. And you could fuck them. I never stick my dick in a froget, though. Me neither. Or biters.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:01.062 --> 0:19:02.969]: 
  Twiddle your finger. Yes, we are.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:14.258 --> 0:19:14.359]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:23.725 --> 0:19:25.497]: 
  Yeah, the fact that they have no teeth makes a lot of sense.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:25.497 --> 0:19:32.955]: 
  easier to fuck their mouths while they scream. Mm-hmm. You gotta be careful not to get poisoned though. Yeah, because he tries to reach up and grab your dick with his little poison. You gotta expect that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:32.382 --> 0:19:34.508]: 
  You gotta expect a way, you gotta say no.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:34.508 --> 0:19:43.452]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:47.282 --> 0:20:02.014]: 
  I used to hit him with badminton. That's what he did. But I destroyed all our badminton rackets hitting them. Wait, what? I like badminton. Badminton is fun. I used to hit the progots with badminton rackets. Yeah. I always destroyed the rackets. That's a really bad way to do it. My dad would come up to me and be like, boy!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:53.965 --> 0:19:55.720]: 
  I mean, Batman is fun. I used to eat frogs at Batman.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:56.445 --> 0:19:56.715]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:58.268 --> 0:19:59.702]: 
  That's a really bi-way cat.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:02.622 --> 0:20:09.439]: 
  Bad man Come all your parents certainly that I don't know more boy

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:03.533 --> 0:20:05.305]:

  No killin' froggots now. Where's that baby at, sit boy?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20 --> 0:20:52.994]: 
  That's if any good pissing the bed stories. You have any good alive animal stories? I saw a live animal. I saw deer once. It was beautiful, majestic, eating parrots. He fucked it. In a field. Baby deer. I don't know. Whenever I see an animal, I just, you know. If you were writing a letter to a deer, how would you start it? Oh, shut up. Oh, shut the fuck up. Don't be mad. What was your question, Zach? You said? Yeah, when I was seven years old, probably eight. You know, I'm not going to make the age lower so I can make myself feel better. I always think it's funny how people remember, like, when I was six years old, blah, blah. I was six. All my memories were hazy until I was eight. You'll do whatever this one. I don't remember shit. You'll do whatever this one. Whatever it's.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:46.412 --> 0:20:47.897]: 
  six my all my

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:52.116 --> 0:21:10.949]: 
  I remember this one when I was seven or eight, I had a birthday party, and I had a bunk bed, and I had a bunch of Pepsi. My friend sucked in the bottom bunk, and the next morning, it turns out, I pissed off my friends on the top bunk, and I'm not joking, it dribbled down, and my friend woke up and said he felt some splash in his face, and he woke up. It was my pee, that is a true story, by the way.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:10.949 --> 0:21:45.458]: 
  I never lived that down. Not your friend anymore. I have something nearly as embarrassing. Did he come back over to your house? Maybe more embarrassing. No. Because of Peter on it, dude. He woke up with P in this face. And he was in a cave. He was never your friend anymore. No, because of Peter on it. Did you apologize? I started to pee on you. He said, I don't want to hear it. Started to paint on you. Your P went through your address. I pissed so much, it soaked through the top layer of the bed. It dripped down onto this guy's face. I'd been at the time, though. He was like, how was he sleeping for your wiener to be lined up with his face? What are you talking about? It would seep through the mattress. It would spread out evenly. And then it would start raining down like a square.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:45.340 --> 0:21:47.500]: 
  Yeah, he felt some touchy-stacy music.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:47.500 --> 0:21:54.064]: 
  He woke up and it was, yeah. Is that a birthday, he said? It was my birthday. You had some cake though, right? Yeah, yeah, I think.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:53.052 --> 0:21:57.338]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, the other guy felt some duty splatter on his face too. He wasn't happy with that.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:56.747 --> 0:22:06.282]: 
  No, but if you had some cake then the guy you peed on would have some like cakey pee. Yeah. Cake pee? Yeah. Pea cake. Pea tastes like birthday cake. So he was like, Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:00.645 --> 0:22:01.320]: 
  Madam

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:05.640 --> 0:22:08.492]: 
  I put a care though as well that I peed inside of a bridge.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:08.492 --> 0:22:50.140]: 
  I was like, thank you. I blew it out. You put a little candle in this pee hole? Yeah. You blew it out. You could have easily played that off and said that's the only thing you wanted for your birthday. You could have leaned down and said, got you. Like it was a prank that you peed on him. And he'd be like, why would I come to pee? I'd be like, cause you don't get it. No, you're not cool enough to get it. I'll tell you my worst birthday memory. I was a little kid. I guess I was like, I wasn't even, I don't know, I was like six or seven. And I got like an television or a pong or something for as a kid. And my parents invited, you know, all these kids that were from school and down the street and the one girl down the street, she was at the party and we played pong and she beat me. And then I threw a temper tantrum and I ran out of room.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:21.689 --> 0:22:23.174]: 
  Oh, you're not cool enough to get it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:47.997 --> 0:22:48.149]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:49.364 --> 0:22:49.718]: 
  Thank you very much.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:52.570 --> 0:23:04.484]: 
  That's more embarrassing. I think so. Did you kiss her? Because I should have fucking beat her at Pong. It's a man's game. That's hilarious. She kicked my ass. Little tiny Jeff. Yeah. Yeah, I was like, I was like.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:55.658 --> 0:22:56.333]: 
  Cause I should have-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:01.598 --> 0:23:01.851]: 
  little

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:02.779 --> 0:23:03.100]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:05.327 --> 0:23:18.304]: 
  I'm gonna have to... I love when you're a kid how trivial your fucking problems are. You go into your room and punch your pillows. Pong! Pong! Fuck her! Anyway... Let's talk about it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:17.747 --> 0:23:24.784]: 
  Let's talk about what would you do in the apocalypse if the world added what would you do?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:24.784 --> 0:23:50.856]: 
  I would run from bad man hide in basement and I would build a thunder down first of all You'd do what? You guys live with thunder downers? Oh from Mad Max? Yeah, it's a big metal cage with weapons on the side and two men enter, one man leaves. That's the rule. Now would you be the guy who looks over it? Oh I'd run it, I'd run the thing. Jeff would see our top and look down. Yeah, I would just, you know, I'd be like the promoter.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:28.058 --> 0:23:32.378]: 
  I would build a sundered down first of all. You'd do what? That's fine, Mel, get your nose.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:40.191 --> 0:23:40.208]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:45.473 --> 0:23:47.532]: 
  We can't just put it, you know. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:50.856 --> 0:23:54.602]: 
  Who, let's suppose you're the leader of the free world, Jeff. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:53.843 --> 0:24:05.267]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:06.499 --> 0:24:19.155]: 
  You really didn't pause on Adam Sandler. He just spilled out of your mouth like sweet sinful molasses. I would give the other guy a few extra chainsaws on his side at the Fender Dome. Jeff was just going by alphabetical order.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:13.739 --> 0:24:14.160]: 
  That's it.

You really believe Rob Schneider is the worst person in the world? I know for a fact there's someone at the right now who's like cutting off a kid's head and fucking with a knife. I'm sorry, did that person start duskigolo too? That's so... Oh my god. Probe Rol. I like Rob Schneider. Fuck Rob Schneider. He's completely harmless. You know, he's only guilty as being the most successful worthless coattail rider in the world. He's basically a coattail rid sandler into his billion dollar success. Yeah, but he always plays like weird, foreign creepy guy, like weird stereotype. It's like, I have a... You know, you know... They make cameos in each other's movies all the time. I wouldn't say they're like coattails.

  I can't imagine seeing Adam Saylor... Why are we talking about Rob Schneider? Is he a friend of yours? Who gives a shit? I like Rob, alright? Oh, really? You don't like Rob at all? You said that if Rob Schneider was at a party, he'd be the one guy you would not talk to. Right now, people are raising an eyebrow at you, Zach, because it's all pro-Hitler this, and I love Hitler that, and fuck Rob Schneider, he's the worst person here. I love Hitler, I think he's a cool guy, there's a difference. Oh, shit. Isn't Rob Schneider Jewish?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:39.184 --> 0:26:40.180]: 
  by Drake Crue infinity!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:44.247 --> 0:26:54.422]: 
  Underage girls get enough credit. They are on the radio. From some questionable people. Not everyone's into them. It was the Interstellar Biblical Z.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:52.718 --> 0:26:56.937]: 
  Scooters teeth are so awful that I want to say hey. I'm going to beat you girls on my ass today.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:55.317 --> 0:27:41.436]: 
  Underage girls, pretty so that. Olives and popping cherries, I guess, right? In a world where underage girls would be plentiful and... Accessible? For everyone, despite your social class? Unbreakable. Well, I got an idea. Let's write a story on the fly. And I don't know, maybe somebody can animate it. Zach, you start with a sentence, I'll continue it, and then we'll do a round robin until the story's over. Go. A man looked to the toilet bowl. And he saw a reflection of his wife.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:29.539 --> 0:36:29.640]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:57.366 --> 0:36:58.277]: 
  That's weird though.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:08.487 --> 0:37:08.689]: 
  Well

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:09.482 --> 0:37:11.946]: 
  All these masked people are so lusted.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:18.240 --> 0:37:19.101]: 
  All the design to do.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:37:36.989 --> 0:37:37.849]: 
  syndrome

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:54.589 --> 0:37:54.758]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:55.804 --> 0:37:59.939]: 
  Yeah, I'd say my penis is short when it's a flaccid.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:37:59.939 --> 0:38:14.502]: 
  Yeah, totally the balls. Well, yeah, that's what we're talking about. My flaccid ball dick. I'm sure plenty of people are running that problem. I'm not a fucking weirdo. Are you sure? You do have long balls, though. That's just the fact.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:11.329 --> 0:38:13.962]: 
  That's just a...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:14.046 --> 0:38:19.109]: 
  One time I was looking at the staffer sit down and he had this huge fucking bulls going down

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:15.497 --> 0:38:25.994]: 
  One time I was looking at the staffer sit down and he had this huge fucking bolt going down to his knees But it might just be your balls Yeah, you saw one on either side of my fucking

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:24.357 --> 0:38:24.947]: 
  life.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:38:27.985 --> 0:39:34.337]: 
  Do your uh, your balls are gonna suck up your asshole like a vacuum? No, like your asshole is like a black hole and he's like Yeah, yeah, it's sucking your balls out. That is a common problem, because when you're like taking a shit in the toilet and you stand up too fast your balls will use centrifugal force. Oh, stop. That'll fall up into your, into your bum. And because you're standing up, there's like an air getting sucked up into it. So if you actually swing forward then swing back, that's the most dangerous thing you can do. What you're supposed to do is you're supposed to spread your legs as far as they go, grab your balls while you stand, stand up, and then put them in front of your legs when you close them. I knew a kid in high school got one ball removed. Really? That was not a fun, that was not a fun, it's not a fun time for a high school kid to know when everybody knows you have one ball. Yeah, that's mean. We had a teacher who had a one nut and everyone made fun of him because he was an asshole. He was my PE teacher. Yeah. How did he even, had people even find out? Had people just find out, I don't know. Chris, let's talk about, you had a spiritual year a couple days ago, didn't you? Yeah. I'm sure. Well, it wasn't so much the dream, it was how I woke up from it. It was, I was having a nuclear dream with nukes going off, because Zach made me watch that fucking nuclear movie. Everybody says nuclear. Nuclear, nuclear. Why does everybody say nuclear? Because,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:38:28.103 --> 0:38:30.938]: 
  Do your balls ever do such a good asshole?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:34.279 --> 0:38:36.186]: 
  Yeah, he had suck of your balls.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:40.894 --> 0:38:41.384]: 
  Of course.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:50.732 --> 0:38:51.492]: 
  What you supposed to do?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:51.492 --> 0:38:52.454]: 
  to spread your legs.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:38:59.760 --> 0:39:00.452]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:04.637 --> 0:39:05.751]: 
  That's me

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:17.445 --> 0:39:20.449]: 
  couple days ago, didn't you? Yeah. I'm sure.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:30.895 --> 0:39:31.941]: 
  Nuclear.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:31.941 --> 0:39:32.650]: 
  That's it for today.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:33.240 --> 0:39:37.999]:

What if everybody heard that nukes were coming and they figured it'd be pointless to get in their car and drive away because I think the roads would be too congested but everybody thought that so we all just sat here and died. I know what I'd do. I'd drive my drive over to the deaf center and just park outside and just go out. I don't know what I'd do because they're deaf so they don't know what's happening. They don't hear the sirens. Yeah they're just relaxing in there and I'm just gonna pretend it was them. Yeah. Just go inside and go out peacefully. Yeah that or just stand aside and like laugh. I wouldn't make fun of them. No, I just. What if somebody runs in and frantically does. What would you last night make you put a deaf people? What could you do? What could you do with a deaf person with impending death coming and they didn't know it was coming. Dude somebody's gonna read a closed caption news program and run in and do frantic sign language and you're all gonna stand up and go. What is a prison limit doing sign language?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:45.554 --> 0:46:21.008]: 
  It'd be like fucking dance signals. Those shapes that you throw when you're dancing. Yeah. It's just these sign language movements you've never seen in your life. They're just like this epic sign language movement. It would be like, this is a small sense of satisfaction. It'd be so blurry. You wouldn't even be able to see it. They need their all their entire arm to like do them for like the atomic bomb. It's so rare. Like there's a little sense of satisfaction because they've never gotten to use like the mushroom cloud sign language before. They're holding their arm. They like expand their arms over the head like a mushroom cloud. But then do they all panic verbally or do they all panic with sign language? Like.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:56.995 --> 0:46:00.134]: 
  small sense of satisfaction. It would be so blurry, you wouldn't even be able to see it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:21.008 --> 0:46:21.362]: 
  Oh!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:22.628 --> 0:46:30.019]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:34.643 --> 0:46:49.949]: 
  Oh yeah, because like it takes so long to explain the point. It's so long of silence, it's like... And the dudes like, it's the one guy doing the nuclear bomb, some of the other guys like put his hands on it and he's like little legs running. That's the direction!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:46:37.208 --> 0:46:38.406]: 
  It's so long.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:39.992 --> 0:46:40.617]:

His first speech would be like, my fellow Americans, he finished, and all the deaf people would be like, yay. They'll probably fix deaf people like in 50 years. Probably won't even be any. You know what's weird, they're already starting to, they've done a few. Oh, the other, what are they called? They're like 3D print year implants. Yeah, but see, I'm like really on the fence about like how to feel like, you know, there's all these uplifting videos with this uplifting music, and it's like, and now she's gonna hear what a crunching apple sounds like for the first time. But then it's like, who's to say that they're hearing it right? Like maybe a crunching apple sounds like, eeerrr to them, because they installed their, I mean, it's not like they're, I don't think they're installing like all new wiring. It's like the basic pieces are in there. I think they're just one little thing missing. Yeah, but yeah, I know that, but like, who's to say that they're hearing it the way it's supposed to be heard? Cause it's still kind of beta technology. Oh man, yeah man. It's also objective.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:46.997 --> 0:54:13.440]: 
  I did zipper you you fucking disgusting. Mine's like Christmas. You said that before. It's true. It's like a descriptive you constantly use for your wiener. It's true. It's pale. The only thing your deck has in common with Christmas is... It snows. Is it... It's cold. It's because it's got dandruff. Nailed it. Christmas is not dandruff. Hey, Snapper, what do you think they don't make in China? Black people? Chinese.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:56.717 --> 0:53:58.928]: 
  The only thing your dick hasn't come

  area

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:20.545 --> 0:54:21.827]: 
  But, yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:25.169 --> 0:54:30.383]: 
  Oh my goodness. That's bad. It's like what we were saying.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:54:26.502 --> 0:55:44.363]: 
  That's bad. It's like a little- Oh yeah, wait, oh wait, we were saying- It's like a riddle. You were gonna talk about the places we liked, like, places we've been, we didn't like, or like, like the least, like, uh, visited. Just do full-on hatred without any filter. Even if it's a place you kinda like, what's the worst place, what's the worst part about it? And then be angry about it. You start, Jeff. Just go, just rail. I've been in South Korea, and I could talk about that a little bit. Do it. First of all, during the summer, it's, I don't know how interesting this is gonna be, but, uh, it's more humid there every single fucking day in the summer than it is the most- The average humid day over there is more humid than the most humid day anywhere in the United States. It's true though, it's something that people wouldn't really expect when you think about, like, um- I don't know if it's- They're closer to the equator. I don't know what it is, but it's- It is un-fucking-bearable. And those people, they've like, evolved. What do you mean, those people? Those Koreans. Those dang dirty Koreans. The damn, damn South Koreans. They've evolved not to sweat. Like, every white person over there, every pasty white person was sweating their balls off. All these dudes, all these other Koreans, they're just standing around watching Breaking Bad on their cell, on their phones, their TV phones. And like, Walter White is like, Oh, sweat!

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:38.314 --> 0:54:38.432]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:38.432 --> 0:54:38.449]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:54:41.234 --> 0:54:41.909]: 
  even if it clicks.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:25.733 --> 0:55:27.539]: 
  Koreans. Damn, damn.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:43.064 --> 0:55:47.940]: 
  like Walter White is like Oh, so it's almost two Yeah Just the Pikmin No, no, it was one

 SPEAKER_03 [0:55:46.709 --> 0:56:47.745]: 
  No, no, it was well. It was subtitled but it was kind of funny seeing them watch that over there But do you mean does that mean that when they come over like to somewhere that's not human at all? Do they just like do they break in and rashes or whatever? I don't know. What do you mean? Hey, but those filthy chinks Okay, those damn slants But they didn't they don't bother air conditioning their stores see everything as hot as fuck when people talk about like vacationing abroad to you know like Korea or Japan the one thing you never hear anybody talk about is the weather ever so like you'll never know these things There's actually good knowledge to have that Korea is this weltering hellhole and then as I'm South Korea as I'm spear experiencing this This one like my brother's like Korean girlfriend. I know she's telling me about our fan death And I'm like what is fan death? Have you guys heard of this? Yeah, it's a it's a superstition that they believe if you run a fan in a room at night It can suck like the air out of the room and kill you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:51.265 --> 0:55:51.518]: 
  But

 SPEAKER_00 [0:55:56.715 --> 0:55:59.264]: 
  I don't know. What do you mean, day? Those...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:26.989 --> 0:56:27.293]: 
  3M

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:37.789 --> 0:56]: 
  I think it's... Yeah, it's...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:48.690 --> 0:57:55.971]: 
  No joke. What? Even though a fan is pretty much scientifically proven just to push air around the room. So good air? It does nothing with the oxygen molecules. Do they mean if you have a fan blowing hot air out of your room, like exhaust? Not even in our ass. If there's a ceiling fan running, if there's like a little portable fan on the table, they believe it can kill you. I almost feel like if I live there for long enough, they'll rub off on me. Or possibly it can, or like one of the explanations is it can make a room cool down so fast if the coldness can kill you. I don't know what the explanation is, but it is so crazy that manufacturers over there have bowed to this superstition and they put a timer on their fans over there so they go off at night so they aren't scared that they'll die in their sleep. So it's like a 13 floor sort of thing. Yeah, yeah. They do know that that's stupid and wrong, right? You would think, but they don't. No, I got into a big argument with this because this girl was, she's like very smart and intelligent, but she just believed this one particular thing and I'm getting mad. I'm like, you're kidding me. This is nonsense. She's like, no, this is true.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:53.432 --> 0:56:55.997]: 
  Push air around the room.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:11.117 --> 0:57:11.539]: 
 Ba Ta executive

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:18.492 --> 0:57:18.627]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:36.413 --> 0:57:36.531]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:57.625 --> 0:58:05.624]: 
  That's so weird that people can just... That's just like beyond reason. The only fan death I have to worry about is becoming too popular. Am I right, Zach?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:02.114 --> 0:58:02.704]: 
  You're the only fan that's...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:06.957 --> 0:58:06.990]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:07.311 --> 0:58:07.750]: 
  Yes!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:58:07.750 --> 0:59:00.484]: 
  Did you fall asleep? His story wasn't that fucking boring. But no, it'll be so cool. Anyway, I don't know what to say besides like Korea, South Korea is very much just like, it's as much a bizarro America as like Canada is. There are like three sides of the same coin kind of there all. South Korea is almost like the world of, what's that maybe, Blade Runner, where everything's like more advanced a little, but it's also dirtier. It's dirtier and more advanced at the same time. It's gritty. Yeah, like I couldn't figure out how to open the door to McDonald's because it was like automated somehow. There was some special sensor you had to push and I couldn't even fucking find it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. All the toilets I'd find, all the American toilets had like 30 buttons on them. I didn't know what they meant either. They had a slanty eye scanner on everything. You have to push your eyes back with the tips of your fingers. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:11.462 --> 0:58:12.610]: 
  Make it work in Borell.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:48.030 --> 0:58:48.891]: 
  No, no, no, no, no, no.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:58:57.075 --> 0:58:57.447]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:57.278 --> 0:58:57.413]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:59:02.391 --> 1:02:34.476]: 
  Weird it's a little weird over there. I I didn't like certain aspects, but it was cool another aspects I guess I guess I want to be unfair What do you hate Chris the worst place I've ever been was Dublin was where I hail from in my country Do you want to guess where it was Dublin? No waxford Dublin? Okay, but uh, yeah, I hate Dublin because every time I go there something horrible happens Like what like the first time I was like there was like 15 with my friends and I was walking in the street And we were walking by some shop with a hash leaf on the front of it And I was like are they a ladder show the hash leaf on the front and some guys just like smashed me in my face He split my lip open and kept walking and another time I was there I went into McDonald's I was eating food and this old lady came in and she shoved her hand in my food She was like this is where I sit and I was like great I left and then just every time I go there something horrible happens It's fine. I don't have to live there. It's just I did have to live there when I was in college So it was a little plenty of fucking bullshit. What what do you not like about America? Let me think I You know what everything that's bad here is bad at Leno elsewhere, right? I guess the police here are crazier, but not really in this area in Ireland. Can the cops carry guns? No Which is this pretty cool except that they're all kind of pussies like that's where all the videos come from Where all the kids are like what are you gonna do faggot and they really can't do anything? Yeah, like in Ireland like we've I've had situations in Ireland where like people have been getting hassled on the street You call the police they show up, but they did just they just pretty much be like look You can see to stop that now or we'll have to come back and then they're like, okay And then they can just continue and run away But usually the police in Ireland are good enough that they'll usually catch what when people want something bad going on Even if they've already like gotten away. They wear those like stupid British police hats or do they have like more American? Well like Bobby hats Bobby hats. They don't have Bobby hats. They've got like the flat top ones Okay, yeah, you have to get get used to the way we handle cops around here So protocol in America for dealing with cops is to hate cops and go online and talk about how much you hate cops And then go around and harass and film them and upload those videos And then continue talking about how bad cops are even though you're fucking with them all day You know they're 13 and they've never even had a run-in with a cop with they're like Fuck the cops here has been really great The cop in our area they've been like really like amazing I've never had a fucking problem with a single cop my entire life I have I have I've met a lot of fucking horrible police officers But it's not to say like because there's a ton of great cops But it is the one profession where that old saying that one Apple spoils the whole bunch It it applies to police officers more than anyone else because you know They'd be like 50 cops on the force But if one of them is going out doing crooked shit and all of a sudden you fucking hate cops regardless of the other guys They're just out there trying to do a good job, which is fucked up, but it happens It just seems like these guys I not sound too sympathetic But they deal with assholes all day long and I'm like I'm not interested in contributing to that I'm just I figured if I'm if I'm respectful to them They won't give me any shit back and that's for the most part Worked out I do see cops fucking with kids and stuff and there are some times we really raise an eyebrow out there At their actions, but I just fucking hate these video these YouTube videos of these little dickheads carrying around their AK-47 down the highway Yeah, like they walk in front of a police car just to get the cop to notice them. Yeah, I'm gonna prank cops today

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:26.978 --> 0:59:27.940]: 
  Like.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:48.274 --> 0:59:49.574]: 
  This is where I sit!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:00:27.627 --> 1:00:28.892]: 
  Yeah, like in Ireland like

 SPEAKER_01 [1:01:16.058 --> 1:01:16.446]: 
  the cost.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:11.931 --> 1:02:13.619]: 
  For the most part it's true. So far it's worked out.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:34.476 --> 1:02:36.467]: 
  I see my right, my right!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:36.467 --> 1:02:44.449]: 
  No, it's not even about pranking, there's people going to like, Chile or that Chile, what's it called? Oh, Chipotle. Yeah, they go in there with like AK-47s, they're like, IT'S A REC-

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:41.648 --> 1:02:42.610]: 
  Yeah, they go in there with like

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:43.825 --> 1:02:47.217]: 
  It's alright!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:02:45.225 --> 1:03:25.405]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm like, you're just, you're scaring people who just want to buy a fucking burrito. You cunts. Fucking idiot. It should be shot. Those guys with their cell phones, they're like, I have never rights to film you. I'm just gonna sit here and put my camera in your face. Yeah. And then they get upset, and they almost get upset, and the cop reacts calmly. They're just like, well, it's within your right, sir, but, you know, if you could just listen to what I'm saying. You're getting in my way for something I'm trying to do. What are these fucking cunts that, uh, when a cop is trying to deal with somebody else for another situation, like disorderly conduct or whatever, some asshole runs up to them with the phone, and he's like, what do you do? What are you arresting them for, huh? Huh? Like getting in the cops.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:51.689 --> 1:02:53.325]: 
  That should be shot.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:55.165 --> 1:02:55.182]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [1:02:58.692 --> 1:02:59.012]: 
  What should I do?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:06.488 --> 1:03:08.226]: 
  You just listen to what I'm saying.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:07.821 --> 1:03:08.007]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:26.620 --> 1:03:54.582]: 
  Getting all up in the cops grill about it, and cops like, sir, he's back away. I'm trying to deal with this situation. I have my rights. I have my rights, man. Yeah. Hey, so it's a monumental day, and it's a better word for this. But it's the first time that anyone's ever fallen asleep during a sleepy cast. Zach has officially fallen asleep. So we're going to make up lies about him as he sits there, like the piece of shit he is.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:34.872 --> 1:03:35.429]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:55.695 --> 1:04:06.884]: 
  Oh, I also hate uh... I hate Jackson... Jews, Arabs, Japs! What? He woke up! I hate Jacksonville, Florida, the grand majority of Florida to be honest, and I hate Los Angeles.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:05.618 --> 1:04:07.997]: 
  I hear you're talking to us. That's what I see when I'm really...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:04:07.997 --> 1:05:55.525]: 
  What are you guys talking about? The places we hate. Oh. You're a sleepy snake. Everything I said still stands. Okay. Why do you hate a Florida snapper? Lots of reasons, but also because it's just kind of a grim shit hole. Yeah, it seems really... It seems like... It seems flat, kind of boring, really humid, and... It's kind of like scary. There's like a lot of drugs and shit. That kind of stuff going on. Yeah, the areas I was in, they weren't the... I was in West Palm and... But I hated the fact that it rained every fucking 20 minutes and... It just had a really bad time down. You know, like... I'm sure that, you know, there's a lot of good, you know, swains from Florida and... You know, there's a lot of good people in Florida, but... You can't really put your finger on why, but every now and again you'll go to a place you've never been to before. And it's not like you're carrying a bad attitude with you, but the second you get off the plane... You just know that you're not gonna have a good time there. There's just a vibe about it. That's what I... Yeah, like that's how I feel about it with Dublin. It's like the second I step off a train, I'm in Dublin City. I feel fucking scared. It's just a sense of dread and like... It's just you're good pretty much, right? Yeah, it's just your gut. Like, you can go to some place you've never been, but like... You get off in some... In fucking Montana and see how you feel there. Dublin's full of scary people, like... One time I was with a girl at the time and I was visiting her in her... Like, flat. Was that Jack the Ripper? Or no, that was UK, right? That was UK. Yeah. No, no, Dublin. Yeah, no, but one time I was like leaving the flat, right? And I went outside and this like... It was like, out of hostile too. This like, group of like, eight-year-old kids run up to me. And they were all like, wearing shitty clothes. And one of them had cellotape wrapped around its face so I couldn't see his face. And they were all wearing hoodies and they were like, You got any gear, mate? Or whatever. And I was just like, No, sorry. I was like, dressed in a tracksuit and I had a backpack. So I looked kinda scummy, but... They kept following me then the street and then one of them grabbed my backpack and I turned around and was like...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:04:59.669 --> 1:04:59.753]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:05:56.520 --> 1:08:48.729]: 
  The hell fucking ran. It was fucking scary though. Sweet dude. Not really. Do those stories actually happen when like a woman walks up and throws you a baby and you catch the baby and then all All her kids run up and steal all the shit out of your pockets while you're holding the baby? No, it didn't happen in Ireland. That's sweet dude. The kid was a shithead that was like, Gany kid! No. You gotta establish your ground. You have to lean down and be like, Do you have any gear? Faggot! And he's like, No, just as sweet! And he gives you a little tootsie roll. I was trying to play it nicely at first. It was like, no, sorry. I don't do that. And I kept walking and then when they grabbed my bag, I was terrified. I thought they were gonna steal my shit. They just talking about like loot or like? They were talking about drugs. Oh. That's what gear means. Really? Yeah. Oh. That doesn't seem right. They're kids. I know. That's why it was scary. I was asking for like your camera. I was like, these guys probably have like, I thought they probably had like their big brothers waiting around or some shit. Yeah. Like Chris just pulls a big cog out of his pocket. He's like, here you go. They're like, hey! They're like, hey! And your backpack. Hey! Now you were talking about the bathroom and the bloody toilet paper. You're probably even joking about that, right? Yeah. But you know what I heard you can do? You get black toilet paper, right? And you wipe your ass with it and you see brown on black. Why? I don't know. I don't look at my toilet paper. You know what else? You know what else that reminded me of? One time they came out with green ketchup and they just called it a green just cause. Yeah. They had purple ketchup too. I know. But did you ever try eating something with green ketchup? Mm-mm. I felt sick like after two seconds. It tasted the exact same, but just looking at it made me want to kill myself. Yeah. There's a lot of theory behind color when it comes to food. You know, they say that if you eat a lot of your meals off of blue plates. Yeah. You fill up faster. Yeah. Because blue is an off-putting color when it comes to eating. If you put blue food coloring in something delicious like macaroni and cheese, you'll eat like a quarter of it because blue is is an incredibly rare occurring color in nature. Yeah. Not much food comes in blue. I mean, you could argue the blueberries do, but truthfully, they're more dark purple violet. Yeah. Like just, I don't know. It's just eating it and looking at the color is just gross. But if you were blind, you'd be like, and it tastes the exact same. You know, they had purple ketchup. This is to make ketchup fun for kids. But when you're a kid, you like ketchup. It's not like they- When I was a kid, I was like six when that happened. It was like green ketchup and I just didn't want to eat it anymore. Anyways. All right. So, Zach's asleep. I'm so tired. You look like a little, like a baby mouse, like a little pinky. I'm so tired. You're a pinky mouse. Oh yeah. We're going to talk about the Wilhelm scream. Oh, so here's something we were talking about at dinner to wrap this whole fucking thing up. The Wilhelm scream. To open that can of worms up. You know, we should edit it there. Right here. Let's have- Yeah, this fucking thing.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:40.649 --> 1:06:40.716]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:44.175 --> 1:06:45.002]: 
  I was like, these guys...

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:45.002 --> 1:06:45.981]: 
  That's what we have for you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:51.364 --> 1:06:52.950]: 
  He's like, here you go.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:52.950 --> 1:06:55.752]: 
  They're like, hey!

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:27.240 --> 1:07:27.443]: 
  it is

 SPEAKER_02 [1:07:54.882 --> 1:07:55.084]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:07:54.966 --> 1:07:55.050]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:07.150 --> 1:08:07.926]: 
  Oh

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:28.294 --> 1:08:29.459]: 
  Really I

 SPEAKER_01 [1:08:48.948 --> 1:08:50.468]: 
  I hate it

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:49.979 --> 1:08:50.451]: 
  I hate it.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:51.734 --> 1:11:00.507]: 
  That fucking piece of shit jokes aside. It's not even like a nagging thing It's it's a fucking travesty and it shouldn't be used anymore Wait wait so there's some people out there who literally have no fucking idea you're talking about right? They just heard it. No, I know but that's still the problem like what the fuck are these guys talking about right? Alright so the history of the Wilhelm Scream is it's a it's a sound effect of a man screaming That's it must be like 70 years old at this point. Yeah, you can see like I think it originated from an old black and white Western movie where it dude fell up a horse and he was like It began it began to become like an inside joke with sound engineers or guys editing sound where they would throw it into random movies or TV shows Yeah chances are it's in every single one of your favorite movies. There are there are Montages are compiled clips on YouTube above and being in there's like it goes like a hundred clips long You'll see you hear it in comedies and fucking Batman and God of War in Zana Jones Star Wars Lord of the Rings Game of Thrones Yeah from the beginning of that scream all the way up to the fucking new Hobbit movies not to say I don't know They're in the new Hobbit movies. I'm pretty sure But the reason we're talking about this is is because it's now a problem because it Sucks you out of the movie instantly the second you hear it because you know what it is. It's overdone at this point So basically the whole thing is sound designers think they ran on this big joke whenever they use it They think they're being original and hilarious But truth is it's in every single movie ever and at this point it just needs to die because it just sucks at the immersion and Kills the moment. I was what I was watching Game of Thrones, right? Yeah, it's a really great show and I was so into it It seems so fucking flawless. Yeah up onto this one point when they played the fucking Willem scream I was sucked out. It made me so angry. This was so into it was the first time in so long I'd been like really into it Something you know, no totally pull it once you're aware of it It ruins every it ruins any gamer movie you're watching you like when I bought God of War 3 within the first 30 seconds of the first cinematic Camera epically pan down to hell and there are all these goblins running around of course a goblin falls off a bridge

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:07.529 --> 1:09:08.170]: 
  It's alright.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:15.948 --> 1:09:16.202]: 
  손 수준

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:32.183 --> 1:09:32.942]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:32.942 --> 1:09:33.938]: 
  The chances are it's in...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:48.484 --> 1:09:51.453]: 
  Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:56.044 --> 1:09:57.529]: 
  Not to say I don't know if they're in the new one.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:56.382 --> 1:09:56.804]: 
  I don't know

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:58.272 --> 1:10:00.600]: 
  I'm pretty sure they learned everything.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:42.484 --> 1:10:43.092]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:00.507 --> 1:11:06.936]: 
  So too did the might of the olympians. He played the fucking role on screen.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:04.827 --> 1:11:35.505]: 
  And they play the fucking role on the screen. Dude, like, I just wanted to turn the fucking game off. I'm actually being reserved with how much I hate that fucking thing. I swear to God, every time I hear that scream, I want to turn whatever I'm looking at off. It's like, like, imagine that you're playing any game, like a Resident Evil game, but for one second of that game, a picture of Shaquille O'Neal's face just shows up on the screen and then goes away. It's never subtle. It's always punctuated. It always punctuates in the scene. And you just say, oh my god, if I see that fucking picture of Shaquille O'Neal one more time, I'm gonna fucking...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:06.936 --> 1:11:06.970]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:30.814 --> 1:11:31.540]: 
  Yeah!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:36.197 --> 1:13:18.122]: 
  And it's the same exact thing because it totally destroys the immersion and it's a bad quality sound to begin with. It's like, it's how nobody screams. It has like background noise. Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean. It's like, it's got fuzz behind it and they try to like tweak it to make it fit in well, but it doesn't, it never works right. But another thing that that's related to was the fact we were saying that when movies rely on using sound libraries, they never really edit the sounds to make it suit. So, like, especially if you're a content creator like me, Stanford, Jeff, or Zach, we have sound libraries saved for a computer that we've heard all these sound effects a million times. So every time you... Yeah, we have plenty of collection. This is what you're supposed to do when you use a sound effect. You're supposed to bring it to an audio editing, just like piece of software, and you change it ever so slightly so the person doesn't realize it's that sound. You can do this in a variety of ways. You can change it up, slow it down, pitch it up. Change the pitch or add more sounds on top of it so it blends in more. Pitch it down. If it's an explosion, then layer two explosions and put them both at 50% volume. But what we're trying to really get here to in the long run is that sound designers or sound engineers in Hollywood are fucking hacks. They just use the sounds, throw them in, and then they're done and they get paid 20 grand. Yeah, if you're a sound designer and you're just pulling shit off a CD, a pre-prepared Sony sound effect CD for movies and shit, then you're not a sound designer. You're a guy with a fucking CD. The editor could do that. Yeah, would you like to mention the latest sound that is bothering you? Oh, the door. Oh my god, there is this one sound that bothers me more than fucking anything and you've heard it a million times. It's the sound of this rusty gate opening and they use it on everything if somebody opens an oven. It's like this. I could probably probably probably have it. Yeah, you have it. I have it all over the place. This is it. This is it. Yeah, right here.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:58.692 --> 1:11:58.742]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:58.742 --> 1:11:59.029]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:23.852 --> 1:12:24.595]: 
  Change the page.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:41.807 --> 1:12:41.875]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:41.875 --> 1:12:41.892]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:12.807 --> 1:13:15.996]: 
  Probably have it. Yeah, you have it. I have it all over the place. I

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:13.262 --> 1:13:13.752]: 
  I probably have her.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:15.996 --> 1:13:16.907]: 
  This is it!

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:20.772 --> 1:16:14.061]: 
  They use it on any door regardless of whether it's fucking rusty or not every prison door kids spreading his asshole Yeah, anything it's fucking ridiculous. I hate there's a handful of sounds like that Then I'm so sick and tired of hearing but that one stands above and beyond every other fucking sound It was in that new shit shit show sleepy hollow For example in the first episode they used it twice back-to-back fucking what was it gonna say there? I swear like the same audio guys doing all these brand new shows they don't yeah They're when I hear when I hear that rusty door sound I shut off whatever I'm watching okay regardless of what it is Yeah, I could mention how it's not sound related, but it's the same same vein You could say where once you start creating media with the existing Fonts that's what I wanted to say. He's talking about fonts Yeah, once you once you start being aware of font libraries as a graphic designer Everywhere you look every store everything you see you start seeing the same fonts and everything just looks so much lazier to you Yeah, every piece of signage is looks what incredibly ladies what I hate is when somebody uses a Like a grunge font when like the letters are torn up Yeah, but then they use the a the same time and it's like the same a So they didn't trash like the second a in a different way But when I do see when I do see that they actually put the effort in to like make the second a look better or whatever Then I I immediately get a hundred percent more respect for them. Yeah, that's true. Yeah People hopefully people understand that what we're talking about People just need to not be lazy. That's it It's like if there's a font of like somebody like a really rough like painting with like a paintbrush these letters And they use the exact same letter twice in a row. It's like then they're just hacking shit out on the computer He ruins the illusion that it was painted or stamped or whatever Which was the whole point of the font to begin with yeah You know what the like the best way to do anything like that is is to like even though it might look a little worse You might as well just create your own font or create your own sound effects Yeah, because then people will never call you in anything even if the sound effect is like slightly worse No one's gonna give a shit like unwashed masses won't notice but everybody in your field will know Don't be lazy or be lazy But don't call yourself a fucking engineer or a designer if you're fucking if everything you do takes you Seconds these guys probably just have no passion about what they're working on anyway. I guarantee you that I bet they're underpaid Anyway, it's time to wrap up this shit show Time to wrap up this shitty podcast this podcast full of retards.
