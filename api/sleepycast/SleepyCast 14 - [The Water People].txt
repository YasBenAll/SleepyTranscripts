 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:00.497 --> 0:00:23.093]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense. A world enveloped by a seemingly unending ocean of forests. Buried deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little cabin. And in that cabin...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:00:23.009 --> 0:04:10.939]: 
  Welcome to Sleepycast! I am... Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chory Spaskin! Woah! This is cool! And my... to my right is... K-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-koryish! And to my left is... Nile White? Whoa, you're in 90s and I'm... Nah, nah, no, no, no! Holy shit, Cory! You- you- that's like a talent! How do you do that? You like the guy who's like, you know that song that's like, uh... Now to the left! It's like, now to the right! Well it's like when you... It's like when you're a kid, and you're like, You see a giant dinosaur, you just... Pew! What? It's- it's- it's- Wait, this is not what I saw. You make fucking sound effects and you're a kid to like, instrument like giant things? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, giant things? Can we actually talk about it? You just brought up a good idea for a topic. When did you guys stop playing with toys? Oh, shit. Actually when I started really getting into playing with toys was a toy story. Really? Yeah. Because they had like adventures and I'm like, Oh, that's... How could they have like a bunch of toys from the 50s? And I have a bunch of like shitty toys that got a McDonald's. I- Oh yeah. Wait, what? I used to play with my little matchbox cars, and then I played with like, my teenage movie Ninja Turtles. Uh, but Chris... Matchbox? Yeah. I don't recall. Chris, you have a wide selection of toys with you at the age of 24. They're not toys. Yeah, they're like, Oh, they're figurines. What- what age does the line blur between toys and figurines? Yeah, they're an action figure. They're not toys, they're fucking statues. But if you gave them to a five-year-old, they'd be toys. No, they wouldn't. They would take it at fucking- I would not give them to a five-year-old, because they would break. They'd fucking smash it on the wooden floor. I will be the first to admit that I fucking think toys are cool, right? Yeah, toys are cool. No, but I'm just saying, hypothetically, like, if a mom bought the same figurines that you have for a five-year-old, She wouldn't though, because they're like a hundred dollars. They'd choke on the hair pieces and fucking die. Well, some of them are, but um, the reason I brought up- There's no way you know. The reason I brought up the topic is because I remember the day I stopped playing with it, and it was a sad day, because I used to play with toys like crazy. Well, why did you put your foot down and be like, I'm not playing with toys anymore, I'm a grown man? I was fucking like, 13 or 14. I fucking got home from the dentist, and I was really pissed off because my mouth hurt, and I went in, I picked up my toy, and I was like, my mouth like sagged down and I couldn't do it right, and I got really like embarrassed, and I never played with toys again. I actually stopped playing with toys, and then I started to smash my toys. I went through a phase where I started to get toys just to break them. I would never smash a toy. You go through weird phases, I can, you know, I'm one of those people, and I went through weird phases where I had toys, and then you know like, fucking stretch Armstrong's that are full of like poisonous like wood and shit? You used to put plasters on it when they cut, and it don't work. Yeah, I used to like, I was like, oh, fucking, you can't rip them. I would like jump on, I would like hang from like the side of my fucking like stairs, like I'm like climbing a mountain, and they fucking rip and I fall on my back. Oh shit, they're made out of fucking crap, dude, what? You guys have severe cases of the odds, as they say. Listen, as the Jocks have brought it out of the woodwork, the new term is odds. Yeah, the Jocks, the Jocks, they call you fucking kisses? I don't know if they coined it. No, they're good. Is this real? No, they pull your pants. The Jocks, yeah, they say it. The Jocks, when they got a hold of you, you know the odds. They'd empty your pockets, give you a wedgie, and give you a swirly, and then call you an odds. And a girly. Yeah. Fucking odds. So you're calling me an odds because I like toys? Yeah, I like the odds because both of you have the... You said when I stopped playing with toys, well, I stopped playing with toys around like when I started to get into video games. Right. I've always been into video games at the same time. I had a second genesis. It was around... I had action figures. I stopped playing with actual fucking toys, and I started collecting Marvel action figures and Dragon Ball Z action figures, and I create stories with them that way. But all my fucking shitty McDonald's toys and stuff, I got a good will. You got McDonald's toys and good will?

Oh, you're a furious that I didn't get to play with dragon ball with his anger Cuz I didn't even like dragon ball with his anger I fucking I got a dragon ball was third 21 dude, and then I bought a million statues I'm like I missed out on the coolest battles of my I bought a childhood I bought a fucking like yeah, I was so obsessed with Dragon Mosea at one point I would just say if it was Dragon Mosea related I would fucking have it It doesn't matter if it was like the I these like fucking glow-in-the-dark gold Goku figurines that were like the shittiest plastic on earth and Looking at them alone would fucking smash them and I bought them and they were like $18 I first saw Dragon Ball Z for the first time when I was like 21 I think I was all I could think about was how I used to imagine my toys fighting in the exact same way to Goku Yeah, I was like how the fuck did I miss this? Yeah, like all the kids were doing the energy ball thing where they're like with their hands No, but I used to literally have like the connects men and I'd like make him fly through the sky and fucking smash the shit out of each Other in my mind and then when I saw Dragon Ball for the first time I was like this is how I used to think when I was younger and the same with file fantasy advent children I was like whoa, this is just how I used to imagine myself playing with toys I used to I keep in a phase where I stopped kind of playing with toys and I started making my own characters And I fucking shit you not my original like Dragon Ball. Yeah my OC official Fucking I think I was like 12 or like 13 year old Dragon Ball Z characters Yeller and redder guess what color their hair was Yeah, red was red and yellow was yellow. His name was fucking yellow and redder And then After we got we we got rid of those fucking characters because they were gay that we made gay Then we made Spence and Tekken and Tekken it was the same concept Did you just see the Tekken game and say no Tekken the game I've heard the name Tekken I didn't know it was a fighting game. I just I thought the name was cool and Spencer is a cool name Spence So it's like Spence and Tekken dude like the name of fucking Degrassi High school shit and then we got rid of the name and then I made another character called

  Bye.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:49.127 --> 0:14:46.992]: 
  And like, like, it won't stop. Like, they like, pretty much shame you. They're like, yeah, you're the poostream now. It's so weird. And did you feel ashamed? Dude, I was like, I was just, I was totally confused. The sound that was playing was like, ahhhh, ahhhh. It was like, it was like screaming. It was an ISIS dude. I just remember kind of like Second Life to a point where I, I did it, but then like, my computer was already really shitty back then, because I think I had like a gigabyte of fucking RAM. And Second Life was a horror with memory. And it was like, you come in, I have like the lowest quality settings anyways, and it's still like a fucking Microsoft like, slide show. Yeah. And so it's still like an unbearable mess. And yeah, I still tried to experience it and still try, because it was like, it was like fun. I like the simulators, but do people actually pay like tons of fucking money to own a house? Yeah, I know. And they freak out when you go on their property. They pay rent. Like, yeah, they pay rent. That was no truth. That's why it's so funny.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:01.109 --> 0:14:02.307]: 
  I was totally confused.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:43.600 --> 0:14:49.371]: 
  They pay rent like yeah, they pay rent that was another that's why it's so fun to go on the property and piss them off Yeah, when I was

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:47.970 --> 0:23:10.002]: 
  You pissed them off. When I was on Second Life a few months ago and I accidentally went into a room where it was like these five walls and each wall was like, by this house. And I was like, where the fuck am I? And I just pressed T or Y or whatever and it was like, is anyone here? And then someone was like, yes, I'm the real estate agent. And I was like, do you do talking? And she was like, yes. And she came over and she was just like, would you like to buy a house? And I was just like, yes. She was like, how much are you willing to spend? And I was like, nothing. And she was like, well, you can't do that. You've got to spend real money. Like they pretty much make you spend like, what is it, like 50? It's almost like real rent almost. That's right. I heard it was actual real rent, like 400 a month or some shit. Yeah. And it was real rent. I couldn't believe it. I was like, are you fucking kidding me? I swear to fucking God. She has an actual job from doing that. I know. I was doing the same thing. Like I was like, you know, I want to buy my own server and have like land and stuff because I want to enjoy the Second Life experience. And buying like fucking Second Life cash each is like the most bullshit stuff ever. There's like old fat dying ladies with diabetes who do this for like, that's all that they can do. That's their only like bit of life that they're like, wow, I'm fulfilled now. But I don't understand how like people pay real rent, have time to play Second Life all the fucking time. Well, it's like that. And paying, it's like that. It's like dying corpse ladies on social welfare. You know, it's like that makes sense. You know, there was that fucking like game on Steam, I think, where people were paying like upwards like 50 grand to own an actual fucking spaceship. Oh, that's Eve. Yeah. And then people would come in and fucking demolish it and like destroy their $50,000 or stuff. It's so mean. But why would you, I mean, like realistically, why the fuck would you actually spend 50? So you get the best spaceship in the world. Yeah, but it's like, if griefing is an actual probability, what the fuck is wrong with you? You're in space, anything can fucking happen. I almost feel like though that's half the fucking thrill. It's like I spent all my money on this. This is real. This is real work. That could have, that could have went to a fucking house. That could have went to your own goddamn yacht. No, you bought a fucking fake spaceship for the experience. Yeah, I bought a few polygons. To have some fucking Minecraft reddit asshole come in and fucking right faggot all over your shit and destroy your building in two seconds. I feel like those people that, they don't spend like 50 grand at once. They must be like microtransactions over a month. No, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like it's like $100 for like a fucking code game. Dude, you kind of deserve it, but also you can't blame them because like when you know, play like Daisy, when you spend like an hour getting your shit, then there's an actual real feel of losing it. And you're like, I can't lose this. You have motivation to stay alive. I can only imagine how those guys feel. They probably kill themselves in drones. Like they all line up on a fucking wall. On a cliff. On a cliff and they're like lemmings, they just walk off. They fucking like read off their marineros. I was saying that there was one of those ships recently that got blown up and the people who blew it up didn't even do it for any reason. They just did it because they saw a ship and were like, fuck that ship. Exactly. Anyone can come in and just be an asshole and just grief. It's funny. It's a terrible game concept. You don't want that. That's bullshit. Yeah, but the owners of the game are like rolling in dosh. There's a lot of SoundCloud files of like, I don't think they're called Gills in that game, but there are like Skype conversations of people talking to each other after these ships explode and shit and they're fucking screaming at each other. I mean, you would have to be. You're fucking furious. You basically invested like a good 12 years of your life into a fucking ship. These guys are like at each other's throats. That was your fault, you fucking idiot. I think that game actually nearly is 10 years old. Is it? Yeah, and these people were around from the start. I wouldn't doubt it that there would be some fucking heads getting knocked over. After if you knew where someone lived that grieved your house after destroying your official internet spaceship, you better fucking take your life and leave country. They already have nothing left. If they risk their life on fucking 50 grand, do you really think they give a shit about their own life? No, man, they're bathing in their own filth. No doubt about it. Yeah, I mean, I don't mean to talk shit about anyone that spent like 20 grand for something, but it's just like, come on. I do, you're fucking stupid. That's fucking insane. It's silly. No, well, whatever makes them happy. That's what... Well, like there are people who say... Yeah, happy until you get an opportunity where you get fucked. You can say that about anything. It's like, oh, yeah, well, I spent like in my lifetime, like $4 billion on beer and I didn't even realize it. Yeah, but that's all... People spend money on shit that makes them happy. Yeah, but it's like marginal, but if you spent like 50 grand... Because this game came out not too long ago. Yeah. So it's... It would have to be recent. You would have had to invest within the last few years. That's true. You would have had to like, oh, I was going to college at one point, but I'm just going to blow it on this fucking remake of a Star Trek ship and then some asshole comes in and blows it up. Corey, here's a good topic. Okay. So you went back to Missouri or Missouri as you like to call it? Yeah, Missouri, yeah. Do you have any stories? Corey's from Ferguson, Missouri. Yeah, it's weird. I actually was there because it's in St. Louis. Oh, really? Yeah. St. Louis? But there was nothing happening because it was fucking like zero below outside. But yeah, I went back to Missouri to see my old folks and it's so weird to come back because it's been like two years since I've seen my family and it's just like you remember, like you know, like restaurants you go to that you thought were good restaurants, but then you go back there from like being in Philly and you go back and you're just like, now this is a fucking stink, shit hole. And you don't enjoy it. You feel out of place as fuck. And then there's all these like crazy water people around you. Wait, wait, what was that? Water people? Wait, wait, wait. Then it's a term my family made. But you just expected everybody else to know what that means. Everyone knows what I'm talking about. Oh. Okay. Sounds like creepy swamp monsters. Or I listen, people, studio audience, water people. Water people is a term that my family made. My mom believes that the crazy, amoeba water people in our area were created because they drank the water of the place that we live in. The water is tanked. The crazy amoeba water people. This is what my mom, we haven't drank, we only use the water to bathe and to wash it in, but we don't drink it because like it fucking like festers in your body and changes you into water people. And basically what a water person is, is it's, it's, you know, you know that picture of that guy who's like chin is in his mouth and he's like, looks like Popeye. Yeah. That old guy. Yeah. That old fuck that's eating his mouth. Yeah. That's what the water people look like. They're like these gross like redneck old people that can't talk. They're like, right now, right now. So it's kind of like the guy from King of the Hill. Oh, that guy. But there's all variants of them. So there's like, there's children water people and fucking animal water people. Like just all animal water people. Can you like see a water person and be like, yeah, that's a water. Yeah, you can pick him out. You can pick out a normal guy over there and a water. How does how though? Because they walk weird. They sound weird. They look weird. Like tell me and they fucking try to get bargains on everything. They walk into a fucking antique store. They'll go to a China that's worth like $5,000. They'll be like, I'll give you five. Wait, wait, so, so the amoebas in the water, they go, they go into the, they go into the amoebas, the amoeba people. The amoebas go into their brain and they, wait, wait, they go into the part of their brain where they, the fucking amoebas is not a virus. The part of their brain. They are the amoeba people. They're amoebas. Amoebas. They're morphing. Oh, you're very out. Oh, so they are the amoebas. They're the personification of an amoeba. That's even weirder. They're fucking water people. Are you saying that like an amoeba like infected their brain and like, no, no. He's saying that a little amoeba grew up to be a, you know, I fucking say that. I'm saying they drink, they drink, they drink, they drink water and became water people. That's what I just said. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. But it's not, it's not an infectious amoeba that this isn't the fucking powder puff girls. But, but what is it? It changes them to bargain. What are you talking about? Let Corey talk. I'm talking about how you can pinpoint. It's going to be more or non-specific. Tell me all the things you would see in an amoeba person that will make you say, that's an amoeba person. The official water person, he'll try to find fucking bargains on everything. Okay, okay, but that's what he does. What does he look like? The shirt on your back. He looks like the old guy who's eating his mouth. Okay, what is their skin like, for example? It's fucking pasty white and full of nonsense. Okay, full of nonsense. What are their hair like? This fallout, they're losing hair. Yeah, like variations of them. What are the fingernails like? Long and gray.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:54.036 --> 0:15:54.863]: 
  I don't understand

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:59.453 --> 0:16:00.921]: 
  What's like that? It's like that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:03.638 --> 0:16:05.342]: 
  Oh yeah. It's money. That makes sense.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:12.413 --> 0:16:13.510]: 
  Oh, that's Eve, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:15.889 --> 0:16:16.935]: 
  and like destroy their...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:16.935 --> 0:16:18.674]: 
  $50,000 for stuff

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:19.332 --> 0:16:19.720]: 
  Why we

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:23.500 --> 0:16:24.985]: 
  so you can get the best spaceship in the world.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:35.194 --> 0:16:35.667]: 
  I guess

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:47.817 --> 0:16:48.374]: 
  Polygon

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:59.545 --> 0:17:04.641]: 
  Microtransactions over on time.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:12.723 --> 0:17:12.791]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:13.888 --> 0:17:15.036]: 
  I have motivation to stay alive.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:27.237 --> 0:17:28.452]: 
  Now we're saying that there was one

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:34.965 --> 0:17:37.952]: 
  Exactly, anyone can come in and just be an asshole and just...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:47.807 --> 0:17:49.529]: 
  There's like, there's a lot of sound...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:00.835 --> 0:18:01.459]: 
  Oh my god.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:03.957 --> 0:18:05.459]: 
  I mean you would have to be-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:16.039 --> 0:18:16.292]: 
  I think that's it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:34.281 --> 0:18:36.357]: 
  They already have nothing left.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:51.561 --> 0:18:53.316]: 
  I do, you're fucking stupid.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:54.970 --> 0:18:55.560]: 
  No, well whatever.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:57.720 --> 0:18:59.172]: 
  Well, like there are people who say

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:08.774 --> 0:19:10.967]: 
  Yeah, but that's what makes them happy.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:19.894 --> 0:19:19.911]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:37.815 --> 0:19:38.676]: 
  Yeah, it's weird.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:43.165 --> 0:19:45.122]: 
  Really? Yeah. St. Louis?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:08.612 --> 0:20:08.950]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:08.950 --> 0:20:09.439]: 
  at all.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:42.430 --> 0:20:43.004]: 
  that we live in.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:43.004 --> 0:20:43.425]: 
  What are you talking about?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:06.713 --> 0:21:09.244]: 
  Yeah, that old guy is like this.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:10.476 --> 0:21:11.691]: 
  Yeah, he's like, our air.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:22.187 --> 0:21:22.879]: 
  Oh, okay.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:29.072 --> 0:21:30.743]: 
  All animal water people.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:36.599 --> 0:21:37.105]: 
  How though?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:42.994 --> 0:21:43.399]: 
  and walking.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:49.289 --> 0:21:49.795]: 
  Wait, wait.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:51.921 --> 0:21:53.828]: 
  I think Neva's a Neva people

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:54.705 --> 0:21:56.427]: 
  Wait, no! I'm being sent to people!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:13.082 --> 0:22:14.196]: 
  I can water people.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:20.119 --> 0:22:24.557]: 
  No, I fucking say that. I'm saying they drinked it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:28.557 --> 0:22:30.042]: 
  That's what I'm saying!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:35.324 --> 0:22:36.960]: 
  But what is it if it changes into

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:37.922 --> 0:22:42.006]: 
  I'm talking about how you can pinpoint... It's going to be more nonsense.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:52.064 --> 0:22:53.127]: 
  The shirt on your back!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:00.670 --> 0:23:01.429]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:01.429 --> 0:23:01.514]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:11.031 --> 0:27:01.645]: 
  What are their eyes like? Like fucking yellow. Little teeth? Yellow. Their ears. Brown. Wait, Cor, you're making this up. You're a liar. No, I'm not. You're a deep-fret liar. No, I don't. Listen, the water people are like fucking vampires. They change form. They change form into different forms. The fucking water people can look like a human being, but change before your very eyes. They come in all shades of force. There's levels of water people. Like what? It depends how long you've been drinking water. There's level fucking three water people in the level one water people. So you're saying if I go to Missouri and I drink your water, I will turn into a water person. It takes about a year and a half to become a water person. What will happen to me? You'll become stupider. It kills your brain cells faster than beer. It kills your brain cells. It kills your brain faster than beer. There's some chemicals in our water that literally, it's like some shit straight out of Stephen King. If I was a water person, would you still be my friend? Yes. And what percentage of Missouri's? I would find you the best bargains that you would be happy with, Chris. You go into the store and I'd get a shirt off someone's back. So when someone's in the store and they're like, oh, here's a fucking water person again, then they come up and they're like, oh, yeah, five bucks or whatever. Is that what happens? No, everyone's a water person except for like the people who are. Are your parents water people? No, we don't drink the water. We buy water bottles. But how did your parents have the like foresight to see that? Because my mom and my dad, they're like, what do you call those people who like worry about the apocalypse? Conspiracy theorists. Well, yeah, that, but like, they're like worried about the apocalypse. I don't know the truth. There's that fucking truth. They're the guys who like live in like the mountains. Basically my family has prepared for the Y2K. Okay, that makes sense. Cause that happened 15 years ago. Yeah, like they fucking have like Chile and all this stuff backed up for years. Like we have big beans that can last us a lifetime in the fucking basement and upstairs in the attic. So much food and Tupperware and shit in case some, cause my parents are like that. That's how they are. I think more likely that there's something in your baked beans that made you guys like this instead of the water in the water. I'm really fine. I'm not, I ain't no filthy fucking water person. Are you sure, Corey? Look, look into my eyes, my face. Corey, your eyes are dead. I can't be able to. Seriously. Well, wait. So if I became a water person, what would be the first signs? You, you would. Your ears would start browning. English would be a thing of the past. That's what I'd be like. I'd lose to this. You would. You would have Sim English. Sim talk? Sim talk. Oh, that's a Dibo. Yeah. But it would be more broken, and you would be more. Broken. Maybe more broken and broken and broken and broken broken and broken. Broke. Whoa. Yeah, Corey actually hit PTSD there. It was like, holy fuck backwards. I'm telling you. It seems, it seems like a fucking fabled Zack story, but this is not what you think. This is truly true of all true things. There are water people of Missouri. There are water people of Missouri in our area, and like, it's scary because they come in all shapes and sizes. Where do they sleep? They're just families. They live in fucking like dirty houses and stuff. Broken houses. They go to the same bar that's been there for 40 years, and it's just fucking scary. Wait, but this only happened in the last year and a half, right? No. No, it's been happening. We haven't drank the water in 14 years. Oh shit. I'm 100% serious. Do animals meet the water? Even when we shower, we like spit it out. We don't drink the water. Well, why would you drink the water when you shower? Like if it goes in your mouth, we spit it out immediately. We don't even attempt to drink it. If you like, if we're brushing our teeth, we spit it out immediately. If like, the only time we just wash dishes with it, we only use water to clean because we're like, my parents and stuff are terrified of that. Me myself, I don't like drinking fucking faucet water because especially when we used to open the water, yellow shit used to come out. Ew. So yellow because I'm ox.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:39.989 --> 0:23:40.275]: 
  Bye!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:45.743 --> 0:23:46.806]: 
  people in your favorite

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:49.692 --> 0:23:50.164]: 
  You will

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:56.492 --> 0:23:58.146]: 
  Stupider!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:10.954 --> 0:24:11.916]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:12.945 --> 0:24:13.199]: 
  I would

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:20.202 --> 0:24:20.759]: 
  So when it's

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:24.015 --> 0:24:25.922]: 
  All right, five bucks or whatever

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:53.564 --> 0:24:56.432]: 
  Okay, that makes sense, because that happened 15 years ago.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:15.265 --> 0:25:15.332]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:17.307 --> 0:25:18.606]: 
  Are you sure, person?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:41.067 --> 0:25:42.147]: 
  That's it for you guys!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:44.509 --> 0:25:45.910]: 
  Broken and Hickish

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:47.142 --> 0:25:47.749]: 
  Yes!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:50.854 --> 0:25:52.727]: 
  There was like holy- Where'd you- Back-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:02.708 --> 0:27:30.990]: 
  Go for it. So basically, I went back and I visited like, and it was just, it was worse. Like I swear to God they must have had like a water party because there were so many more water people. It's terrifying too because it's like that's the place I used to live and all my high school friends left and all that was left is just like these crazy like homeless people trying to get bargains on stuff that was already broken. So what if there's like a wet t-shirt contest? Like would their titties go all gray and like fall? You don't want to see water people bodies. Why not?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:24.156 --> 0:27:24.494]: 
  I already bought it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:28.712 --> 0:27:28.999]: 
  You don't want to.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:31.632 --> 0:27:39.715]: 
  Cause they don't have bodies. What do they have? They change before your very eyes. What do they just... You know the truffle shuffle? It's like that constantly.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:33.319 --> 0:27:33.539]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:40.795 --> 0:29:10.553]: 
  They're all doing it or they all have their bodies always fucking travel shovel okay Like even when they're standing still they just go so when they walk from place to place or truffle shuffling like Yeah, no, it's true Okay, that's that's the only thing I don't like about going back is seeing all that doesn't really major thing It is scary, but it's like I wanted to see my family are they are they self aware like do they know their water people? my my I mean my parents are naturally like like worried about stuff like It's funny too because my mom has all these theories even though she doesn't like understand how internet's work But she like I love my mom and everything, but sometimes I think my mom's a little too paranoid and a little fucking Listening to too many water people on her downtime because they're like talking about my mom thinks There's this camp that has like these fucking like plastic coffins There's like thousands of them that are just there They're just bare camps that have coffins and I'm like what are you talking about and then she like told me this story She showed me something once and I'm like mom is insane somebody would fucking find out about this This is the age of technology. There wouldn't be a camp with only plastic things She believes the government's it on everything and it's just like oh my god Why would they only have plastic what like what's what's about about that? What she she's like all those plastic coffins It's like maybe they're carrying stuff inside the plastic coffins. She's like no, they're empty She's like it's just the people in her town She talks about how like she there's like she said something like these people the government like captured like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:53.400 --> 0:27:53.822]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:57.265 --> 0:27:58.800]: 
  That's a pretty major thing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:41.916 --> 0:28:42.524]: 
  Somebody would fuck with me.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:11.430 --> 0:30:36.312]: 
  a few people in town and filled them with something and brought them back to like get sign waves and like read things. This sounds like looney tunes, but I'm telling you, it's fucking true. Oh, it's interesting. It's just insane. What else does she believe in? She believes in everything. Anything the government's ever done. She thinks the government did. Like Chemtrails all that shit. It's like the government did it. The government put stuff. That's my mom. Chemtrails is such a weird conspiracy. It's like I love my mom, but I hate the whole theories of government shit. It's like, yeah, mom, the fucking dollar is going to drop to a penny. You don't have to worry about Y2K anytime soon. Dude, Y2K happened? Okay, what? When 9-11 happened, my mom and dad thought World War 3 was happening. Yeah, me too. I remember. They bought a bunch of like coca noodles and shit. That's what my parents do normally. They say, they tell me, I'll say, Court, you have preparation. Do you have lamp oil? Do you have? Well, that's kind of like sweet in some weird conspiracy way. Yeah, but I'm like, Mom, I'm a fucking 24 year old idiot. Who can barely afford living while I have fucking to waste money on lamp oil. She's like, fair enough. Well, once the water people come to power, you're going to need that. Listen, the fucking water people don't leave misery. They fucking stay there. Oh yeah. Court, if I went on Google and typed in misery water people, would I find the water people? You would find the official water people. I don't know if that's, that might be a colloquial term my family gave them. Maybe it's like a scientific term for it, but they're officially called water people. Wow.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:35.865 --> 0:29:35.916]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:51.458 --> 0:29:51.762]:

What you just said reminded me of toys at least to get what I was doing where it's like yeah push a button in their arms fly out I just be like I don't fucking care All I want is a plastic toy with no stupid electronics. It will break in my bathtub when I'm playing swimming Oh, yeah, or no fucking stupid gimmicks like your arms fly What is a toy with good articulation not too much This is so funny Do you know when you get a fucking like Lego thing when you paid for when you kid pay $40? Yeah, one fucking thing like oh the ball rolls down the hill you're gonna do that once Exactly the kids are like they like roll it down. They're like toys where you do it like freaking out I never I never got those Legos where you do you have to buy it for specific reasons like here's a Star Trek ship I got a fucking Indiana Jones It took me like two days to set up because there's a hundred fucking parts and then oh It's a trap door and Indiana Jones fell into the fucking hole. Yeah, I don't get it right I don't fucking get this listen here now, right? This is very nice and Chris is very passionate I used to get toys all the time when I was younger right which is very like oh white person problem But I can't I don't get why fucking toy creators design toys so poorly for kids one fucking They're like oh yeah, this is a toy where you set up a loop the loop for a car and the car does the loop The loop and drives off right yeah, that's cool once kids aren't that stupid You're great I mean you might experience and start like putting your fucking thing at the edge of a cliff and like watch it fly off It's way more fun to have a toy and you make your own creations with it Like and I can't stand toys. I had a fucking ash catch him right I was I love Pokemon right? I got an ash catch and toy for my mom for Christmas All he does is he stands there with one hand down to his side his both feet on the ground and one hand next to him with Pokeball in it and you can't bend his arms or legs So it's like how am I supposed to play with this fucking shit like what he fucking walks like a fucking statue like Speaking of a disappointing presence like we did last week Cory didn't get to say what his this point Oh, yeah, you assholes you did a fucking Christmas special and let me tell you something This is where we're doing I understand I understand and me and Chris We talked about the worst fucking gifts ever that we got for Christmas I got your motherfuckers beat left and right.

  You're just saying. It has like a...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:16.911 --> 0:33:18.767]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:33.640 --> 0:36:35.614]: 
  He smashed it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:37:00.319 --> 0:40:35.847]: 
  And I looked at him, I was tired and exhausted and hot and sweaty and I had like 40 different ticks on my leg and I was just like I'm like, okay, and then I walked home. He's like maybe someday you can have two giant tractor tires And then you can put a tractor together like And then he told me later that the reason why he did that was cuz he wanted to get closer And I'm like, why didn't you just fucking talk to me? Why did you force me to go on a hike and then ground me because I walked home alone? Wait, so no he I'm very confused He brought you up a hill on a hike to give you a huge tire. Is this true? It was it was yeah, it was like gave you a tire that a tire couldn't move because it's a fucking hundred foot tire Why would he give you that cuz he's weird? Why would know? But what was his logic what like the ad to get to know me better? Why would he give you a giant tire to get to know you better because he's insane? Your dad is a fucking idiot core. I don't know if this is you the way you perceive it or if this is true Yeah, that's good point. Maybe you're just a fucking idiot. I don't know No, how how I don't know how I could perceive something of me hiking. How can I forget something? No, cuz you got an iron. You know, maybe on the other side of the tire There was like a bag of gold or something. Yeah, like maybe your dad was pointing at like I circled Maybe your dad was pointing at a new electric guitar or something. I thought there was a joke I circled around it and I'm like what is this and he told me it was a tire and then he maybe he got you a tire like clothes and You you were like maybe you were supposed to get into tire and roll down the hill and get your real presence It was it was there for like 40 fucking ever. It was just sitting there. It was an old tire. Yeah, it was rusty old and shitty What the hell what's wrong with him? I don't know that was years ago. You should have been like dad I'm tired of this and walked away He would have laughed that would have got a raise no But what happened was eventually just came to a point where he just didn't he didn't give me what I wanted He got me what I wanted for my birthday. Yeah, I got a gamecube a PlayStation 2 and Not a computer. I never got a fucking computer I got a shitty hand me down Mac computer and then I got a computer that was fucking shit And I just went to my mom's house and use that computer and eventually got it This is the last thing I want to say about toys, okay You know what breaks my fucking heart what when I was a little wee beba a baby a little wee child with a fat tit All I ever thought one fact all I ever wanted right was like toys of like cloud stripe I know I'm a faggot right that's obviously gay, but I wanted one. I wanted fucking Mario Yeah, all I want was Mario Sonic look what you want you just master chief that's like all I want was like the autism episode Oh, no, all we needed look all I wanted Corey was toys of these beloved video game characters I mean we never seem to get them and then now you go into a target.

I stand behind I didn't get fucking anything and when I finally did get something I swear it was like a few years after stop playing with toys when they started making that is fucking big That's all it now. I mean cuz it's like I think of it now all kids care about his fucking video games All I ever did when I was younger was play with toys This is a huge part of my life.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:25.613 --> 0:39:26.963]: 
  I thought you were.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:39:27.959 --> 0:39:29.477]: 
  Welcome to the Autism Episode.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:39:39.197 --> 0:39:41.577]: 
  I know

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:01.658 --> 0:40:03.700]: 
  Yeah. They should have it or something. No, they didn't. They did not.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:05.607 --> 0:40:06.552]: 
  They didn't, that's true.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:16.305 --> 0:40:17.149]: 
  I didn't get it

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:23.241 --> 0:40:23.511]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:24.422 --> 0:40:24.962]: 
  That's all it is.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:40:36.910 --> 0:42:53.766]: 
  You know what I could never figure out? What? How to do Transformers? I don't, yeah. I don't like Transformer toys. You aren't the kind of Rubik's Cube children. You're like more like... No, listen you shit. I couldn't figure it out. Every time I get... I could figure it out. I was just... I would have like a shitty like... A shitty Transformers toy. And I couldn't figure this motherfucker out. He had like flaps and like wing and like holsters. And I'm like, what the hell? How do I put it together? But the thing is, like when you're done like transforming them, Like you know the movies is like... Or in the show it's like... And you're like, well that was quick. But when you're actually doing it, it's like... It takes like 10 minutes. It's confusing. And then when you're done... Yeah, you can't really play with it because they're so delicate. It's like if I bend his arm too fast, it's gonna fucking fly off. It's like Bionics. Do you remember Bionicle? They were sweet. Bionicle. They were a huge part of the show. They were. They were... I remember that I used to watch this show. And I had... I got a CD once. I will say one thing. A Bionicle CD game. In my cereal box. In my Honeycomb cereal box. I got those. They were doing tiny discs. In my Honeycomb cereal box. They were small. In my Honeycomb cereal box. And you can watch videos of them. Yes. They were kicking rocks against each other. Or you could play like a fucking terrible computer game with one mini game. No. It was so fun. But the thing is, Bionicle, right... They were so cool, right? Yeah. They were awesome. But then when you see the movie, they like really Americanized the whole culture of Bionicle. Oh, it was awful. It was like they have these little movie mess like... Whoa dude! And they're like surfing on lava. It's like, that's not what I thought it sound like. It's funny to be like a fucking tribal warrior. Yeah, he's like... The wind is in the north. Yeah. And the wind is in the south. And the wind is like, come on man, let's go! Come on Ty! You're like, fuck you! Because it got to relate to like the fucking Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and all those other... Quarrels. And another thing about Bionicle is it ruined like some of my childhood. Bionicles? Not really though. It ruined like month my childhood. Because when I was younger, my mom and dad would only buy me games like every like month or two or three. Did you get allowance? No. Really? Yeah, not until I was like 15. I got an allowance. Yeah. My dad didn't give me allowance. He believed money is earned through working, which is reasonable. I think I used to get 10 euro a week. My mom gave me $20. I never got it. Really? No. My mom gave me $20 a week when I was a kid. But wait, this is the last thing I will say about Bionicle. When I was a kid. Yeah, I never, I didn't do anything. When I was a kid. You got a kid, you got the allowance kid? I got $20 when I was a kid. That's bullshit. Do you know what I used to do? I would go to a fucking candy store and waste it all.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:42.090 --> 0:40:42.580]: 
  You aren't

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:48.317 --> 0:40:48.739]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:40:58.088 --> 0:40:59.219]: 
  How do I put it together?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:08.618 --> 0:41:10.238]: 
  It's confusing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:19.215 --> 0:41:19.452]:

  We're serious.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:41:34.639 --> 0:41:35.820]: 
  And you can watch videos of it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:35.820 --> 0:41:37.677]: 
  or the kicking rocks against each other. Or you can play it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:49.995 --> 0:41:50.552]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:26.505 --> 0:51:57.529]: 
  Okay, next topic. I don't know what we're fucking talking about, to be completely honest. Next topic, um... You know what I don't understand? What? I really don't understand this when you were a kid. It's how you could watch the same movie over and over and over. I was thinking about that recently. You know, like, I watched... Oh yeah. I watched fucking Aladdin, like... I was just thinking of Aladdin when you said that! I know other motherfucker. I watched Aladdin so much. Such a little boy movie. I've seen Aladdin. And then, and I played the game. I played the fucking game so many times for the Sega. Yeah. Holy shit. I played that in Lion King, like, retarded amounts of time. Yeah. I watched fucking Lion King, retarded amounts of time. Yeah, me too. There's just something about old Disney movies you can just walk and watch. And I watched fucking Shrek 1. And you enjoyed them every single time as well. Yeah, I watched Shrek... I could still watch Hunchback all the way through to this day, like, over and over. Just because of how interesting it is, the other way. Yeah. I watched Shrek so much, the fucking CD started to skip, and it was breaking, because we took it out and then put it back in. Laser burn? Yeah, it was fucking ruined. Like, it would skip at one part because we watched Shrek 1 so many times. But fucking, like, I was saying that to Mal recently, that when you were a kid, you can watch a movie over and over and over. But now recently... You can play a game. When I see a movie, yeah, yeah, that's true. When I see a movie now, though, it's... You can only watch it, like, three times before you're sick of it. Yeah, no, I'm the same way. I can't watch a movie. Some movies you can only watch once forever. Like, I only saw Slim Dog Millionaire once, and I still remember, like, nearly all of it to this day. Did you like it? Yeah, it was alright. It really depends on the kind of movie. Like, some movies, like, if it ends with a big twist or whatever, you can only really watch it once. Like, I had a Pokemon anime, like, DVD that had ten episodes. Look, you're...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:39.314 --> 0:50:39.634]: 
  his

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:43.988 --> 0:50:45.439]: 
  I was just thinking of letting you say that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:47.430 --> 0:50:51.379]: 
  So much such a little boy I've seen a lot and I played games

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:02.382 --> 0:51:03.124]: 
  Yeah, me too.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:47.421 --> 0:51:48.957]:

  Whatever.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:52:26.571 --> 0:55:00.505]: 
  Did I ever tell you about that time when I was hanging out with Patty Ross? And it was me, Patty, Sean, and some other dude, and we're all watching the movie, and we're all just watching it. And Patty was staring at the blank space for like five minutes, and he just randomly stood up and he pulled his pants down, and he just stood like looking into the wall for a few seconds. And we were just like, what the fuck are you doing? And then he fucking, it's like he woke up from a trance, and he was like, what? And he pulled up his pants. So we were like, yeah, we were like, what the fuck are you doing, dude? And then he didn't even realize he did it, it was just weird. What a fucking weird. I have a question. Have you guys, did you guys ever play Truth or Dare, and actually like do some crazy shit when you did Truth or Dare? Not really. Like crazy shit. Like crazy shit. Like to a point where you would like, when we did Truth and Dare, we actually did stuff like we were like, we did, we... I broke into someone's house and stole something from their house. I didn't as a dare. Oh, no, no, it's okay now. Oh, yeah, that's right. Yeah, no, it was like... It was just a dare. It was a dare. It's no problem. They dare me to go in and take this person's thing. How old were you, Corey? Like 16. Corey, you were old enough to know about it. No, it was a dare. It was a dare. It was a dare. Like I said, like I said, like dare, like my friend had to put on my sister's clothes, and my sister was wearing like slutty clothes at the time, so he had to look like a fucking skank. And I had to go steal something, and someone else had to eat carrots and salary out of my other friend's ass. What? Please tell me you returned at least the salary. I returned it. You returned it. I returned it. Okay, that's fine, okay? I brought it back to show them... It's still not fine breaking the entering. It's not... I brought it back to show them, and then I made my friend eat like a fucking candle to pay him back for that. Oh my god. A whole candle. Corey, fuck's sake, Corey, you're still... No, I'm saying if you ever played Truth or Dare or done something that was actually like... You didn't just do like Truth or Dare, I do you a peek and nose and eat it. You should actually do something like intense, like crazy. Yeah, I would never do that. I would be too scared. No, I didn't. Corey, you live in fucking Missouri. They could have easily bled your head off. Dude, those were water people. They would kill you. They were water people. Oh, or maybe they just wouldn't notice. They were outside in trance by the fire, and I fucking snuck in when they weren't looking at us. That is actually terrifying. I would never do that. Dude, this is like The Walking Dead. That's fucking scary. You walked into a fucking waterfall. It's very interesting. It makes sense now. You could have been... You fucking idiot. It's like breaking bad. And he walks in with the fucking guy with the shotgun. That's fucking scary, Corey. I would never do that. Corey, you fucking giant balls. Corey. Or you dumb.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:54.381 --> 0:52:56.018]: 
  Have you guys, did you guys ever play?

  Ferguson shit makes sense now

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:01.450 --> 0:55:34.120]: 
  Dude, they didn't know. When I left they were still staring at the fucking fire. I'm trying to like justify it. I'm trying to. It's like you could do that Ireland, but you'd still be a fucking idiot. But this is Missouri, Corey. This is like the place where people are known for fucking being dumbasses and blowing each other off. I know, I'm not. Listen, I wasn't aware at the time water people wasn't a fucking colloquial experience. But you told me that that was around for that day. We're there, but you it's it's

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:22.088 --> 0:55:23.894]: 
  Oh, I know that. Now, let's say that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:55:34.947 --> 0:56:42.430]: 
  They weren't caught a lot of people, they were just dead. Like, fucking heroin addicts or something. Like, what they actually probably are. This was the studying phase when you were studying them from a far away camera. My friend. Making your discoveries. My friend's dad actually had a meth lab upstairs. Oh, fucking hell. In his room. I'm not even joking. They actually got arrested. This is like breaking bad, walking dead, fucking Stephen King. What are the people next? The people next door actually broke into Josh's house while he was gone. That's his name. They broke into his house and they stole his shit. People were always robbing him. There was water people around, but they were like, their brains were still functioning enough to know that they don't need to get bargains yet. It wasn't until they're like cognitively... What? Listen. How do you do this, Corey? How do you perceive reality? How do you do this? I'm not... I'm fucking being serious. I don't get it. I don't understand how there could be water people and no one knows about them except for you. They're like locked away. The government won't talk about it. It's like a spoken... Corey, you just stop talking to your mom. I think once every two years is too much.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:40.077 --> 0:55:41.832]: 
  what they actually probably are.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:55:46.101 --> 0:55:47.198]: 
  Making your discoveries.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:21.657 --> 0:56:22.686]: 
  How do you perceive?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:43.881 --> 0:57:06.156]: 
  Nile, if you open your heart to the water people, you will fucking see them. No, they'll fucking eat it. No, they're not zombies, they're just brain dead. I wanna know more about them. Uh, what do they eat? Food. Brains. Oh really? They eat like, bargain food. Drugs. Like, bomb dollar food. Yeah. Okay. They eat no brand food and they don't have windows. Four doors. What are they doing? What are they doing? They're just doing it. They're just doing it. They're just doing it. They're just doing it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:51.492 --> 0:56:52.538]: 
  I want to know more.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:01.566 --> 0:57:02.005]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:02.005 --> 0:57]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:07.320 --> 0:57:36.244]: 
  Is that why it was so easy to sneak in? Yeah. So, their houses are just boxes? And animals come in and out. I get it now, they're not fucking... You just walked into like... A crack house. Yeah, you walked into a crack house. No, no. No, no. It's variant. It's variant. They're just people... It's lower than Hicks. It's people who don't beat the wives and drink beer. It's people who can't even... Use their brain to realize that. It's like, it's a fucking vegetable that can still move and walk. Kind of.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:57:17.749 --> 0:57:18.272]: 
  Yeah, you are.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:19.184 --> 0:57:19.842]: 
  Oh no.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:31.654 --> 0:57:32.447]: 
  Hva gir det ha med skjølt?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:37.290 --> 0:59:11.588]: 
  Do they have gills? No. Okay. They don't swim. Do you think they're evolving or something? Can they swim? Well, there's more of them. There's definitely more waterbills. I went to fucking- I went to Walmart. And- and another thing too is there's only Walmart. And- and there's people that are pushing carts in the walls and shit. And I fucking went into Walmart. Like, platform nine and three quarters. Like, what the fuck? I went into Walmart. And- and the self-checkout and this, like, stupid bitch kept going back and forth. And it was clearly, like, not working. And it set an assistant. And she just kept fucking going. So it just- I just wanted to buy a fucking- a container of Mentos. And so I fucking turned around and left. And I- I went back after buying it. And the bitch was still doing it. I'm telling you, these people are worse than stupid. Cory. But- but we can't- Like, this seems like people need to know more, but- because- They're water people. Okay. You can't- Obviously. Nonsense, Chris. Like- The term water people is the- is the- Tell me this. What is the percentage of water people compared to the normal people? Yeah, the regular population. It's like, 20 to 80. 80%- 20 to 80? 80% being water people. There's like a small margin of people who are still fit and look good. Those are normal people. You're saying that there's a vast majority? Yeah. What? Yeah. And they all have faces that are eating in? They- they go into places, they have no sense of, like, fucking, like, they- they don't understand perception. They don't understand, like- So you're the minority? Yeah, I walked in, I felt so at a place. Oh, that's weird. And it's like, our family, since our family is all paranoid, we don't drink the water, we don't do any of this stuff. So they're just stupid morons, pretty much. We're- we're like the people who are wearing the fucking, like, silver domes and stuff and hiding from the aliens, and they're the aliens. Are they harmless?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:33.248 --> 0:58:34.109]: 
  Amongst the, but yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:37.703 --> 0:58:38.462]: 
  20 to 80?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:58:47.254 --> 0:58:47.997]: 
  and they all have

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:47.997 --> 0:58:49.009]: 
  faces that are eating.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:55.709 --> 0:58:56.873]: 
  So you're the minority?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:58:59.759 --> 0:58:59.826]: 
  We

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:03.758 --> 0:59:04.011]: 
  So, that's all for this video.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:59:10.778 --> 0:59:11.369]: 
  Are they harmless?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:59:12.567 --> 1:00:08.457]: 
  I don't know. You need more research. They fucking... They... One time I went in the back and they had like gutted an animal. I think I got a possum on their table. This is like a ritual? Not on table. On their... You remember that couch, that bloody couch? Yeah. There was a possum that was gutted on it once. Oh my god. By water people. Probably. Wait, so you mean you just looked over the fence, you saw like a possum with his leg spread and his guts hanging out kind of? No, I was curious to see what my old like clubhouse looked like in the woods and there was just like... Well, if it was in the woods, like a fox may have got... It was water people sign. I would never walk into those woods. What are you talking about? How do you have these fucking... Do you have a lack of fear? That is my woods. It's your woods? That's our woods. And then water people walk into there and fucking gut possums. Why do you water people in gutting possums and fucking in my woods? What the hell? Why would you not be afraid to go in there? Because I fucking hold a kettle to her face like I've been just running for the woods.

  And they're like, AHHHHH! They fucking fly into the sky and disappear. Wait. They fucking seep into the ground like the water in the snow. They're slitting back into their swamp. They carry fucking ladles around with dirty gray water and knock on your fucking door.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:00:17.350 --> 1:00:18.902]: 
  Water in my hand. They're back in their swamp.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:00:24.944 --> 1:00:49.817]: 
  I never say it. They're looking for bargains in all the wrong places. Bottle. Why do you think they look for bargains? Because they're fucking crazy homeless old people that are amoebas that can't talk and their brains don't work so they think they can get a bargain on a fucking broken radio. They're crazy! They're cookie cookie. Cory, I think the water is fucking moving. They're cookie crazy.

Mm-hmm. They were taking drugs They were drinking the water beforehand and were Hicks, but the K2 Turned him in the full fucking Hicks. What's K2? It's like a K2 meter measures. Electric Q-Cory the craziest thing to have my school you want to was There was a guy in my class or in my year Yeah, who people called Gaki and he got he and people were like hey Gaki I dare you to piss yourself people like okay, huh?

  Okay.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:25.937 --> 1:02:27.254]: 
  It was only...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:03:27.210 --> 1:06:31.890]: 
  I don't know. Anyways, I went to Chicago on my vacation. All right. And I want you to tell me about your vacation because I haven't had a vacation. You want me to tell you now or after? I'll tell you after mine. Okay. So I saw my girlfriend in Chicago, and Chicago's a lot like New York, only it's more spacey and a lot more artsy in your face with that kind of crap. There's a lot of like, just unsincere homeless people that are around. Unlike New York, you feel like, oh, some of them might be homeless. These motherfuckers are choreographed on this bullshit. And they have like all this stuff set up. I was walking by and there was this one crazy guy who was like, yo man, I like them shoes. I like them shoes. Man, he started going on his story. And he was getting louder and louder the farther he walked back. And I was like picking a pace because I was fucking terrified. I thought he was gonna turn around and fucking strangle me to death. And it's just people like that. Like there's like a guy who's like talking and holding news. I thought he was like handing out a fucking pamphlet. And so I'm like, I like turn around and look at him. And he, it's like he's cute. He runs up to you and he starts talking about like, oh, we're dying at a homeless shelter. We need food. And I'm just like reaching my pocket. I'm like, fuck man. But Chicago's nice. And so it's like the windy city. It's really weird because some areas are super fucking windy but some are just not. And it was already like really cold. I left before like huge like snowstorm came. But the Greyhound is the worst bus experience of my entire life. Oh, it's a bus? It's a bus and it fucking sucks. I wrote some bus that's smelled like fucking spicy ham and a little dog shit. Cause it was like a bus and it had a bathroom. You started off with like something that sounded weird but also not that bad and you ended with dog shit. But I would have rather wrote on the bus that smells like shit. The only difference is it doesn't have times you can like set up. The Greyhound has this like elaborate nonsense with setting up your ticket to get on a fucking over glorified bus and get in line with, oh, I was on my preboarding pass and my boarding pass and my reboarding pass. All this fucking stupid odds shit that nobody cares about. And we finally get off it 15 hours later. You realize that was the worst experience of my life. And that bus I took at five AM that was there in seven hours was way better. Anyways, that's a completely different story. But yeah, that was my vacation. Irish public transport is worse, I guarantee. Tell me. Yeah, Irish public transport. Tell me, tell me fucking bus. If you're a tourist, it's fucking ridiculous. No, like, am I wrong there now? Am I wrong? No. Dublin Bus is like one of the worst experiences ever. Like one and all every, I don't care. Name a nice Dublin Bus driver. Sorry, you can't. They're all like it. I can't name any bus driver. What about? Yeah, that's true. They're all mean. They're all like pissed off. What about Jamil O'Neill? Jamil O'Neill? Shakil O'Neill? What? Jamil O'Neill. Not the best. Is that Chris' cousin? All you were thinking about was the Sonic voice actor and my name. That's all that happened there, Corey. You're not tricking anyone, but anyway. Corey, who did you say was the voice actor? It was the kid in the sixth sense? Julius White.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:46.125 --> 1:05:46.210]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:47.087 --> 1:05:48.066]: 
  That's poor.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:05:53.213 --> 1:05:53.955]: 
  I might, I might.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:01.060 --> 1:06:01.566]: 
  Like one of the

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:05.937 --> 1:06:07.894]: 
  I can't name any bus drivers

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:07.641 --> 1:06:09.480]: 
  driver. Yeah, that's true.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:06:18.036 --> 1:06:18.458]: 
  Is that Chris?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:06:33.949 --> 1:09:16.675]: 
  What the fuck is wrong with you? No. It's like Haley Joel Osmond. But yeah, Dublin Bus, it is, it's shit. I ain't saying that, people. Okay, this is how Dublin Bus works. You're like, hey, hey there, how do I get to Phoenix Park? People will be like, get to 46A and I'm like, where do you get that? And they're like, oh, across the road, bus, what the fuck? Yeah, they go over at the dock, over at the dock. Yeah, and you're like, excuse me, where? And they're like, okay, bye. And you're like, cool. They give you just the name. It's like, you have to go over to the, someone in the harbor and you're like, oh, what? Okay. And they're like, you don't even understand. And they're like, and then, and then you know what really pisses me off? They're like, yeah, you gotta be standing on this side of the road. It's like, how the fuck am I supposed to know this if unless like all these people, if you have to like hunt down people and be like, tell me, tell me how to do this. I have a question. This always kind of bothered me. Do you ever be in a situation where someone stops you and asks you for directions and you have no fucking idea about it? Yeah, and you feel like an idiot? Yeah, that happens almost constantly. Like I'm just walking on the street with someone and they're like, excuse me, do you know where we get the blah, blah, blah? And I'm just like, dude, I don't even know where the fuck are you. And they just look at it like, yeah, okay, thanks asshole. Yeah. And it's like, you really don't know where the fuck you are. You can't just be like, what's the street? Franklin. I think it's like, yeah, it's down that way. Cause then like, you never know if they'll come back. Yeah. I remember the stupidest I ever felt was when that happened. This really nice lady pulled over and she was like, do you know how I get over blah, blah, blah? And I was just like, oh yeah. And I knew, I knew where she was talking about it. And I was like, you go down this road and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. She was like, okay, bye. And I was like, no, I got it wrong. Fuck. And she was so nice. So I just wasted all of her time. Yeah. She probably fucking, she fell off her main and fucking down. She's dead. She's definitely dead. That happened to me. Yeah, you lie off the cliff, dude. That happened to me once, except it was kind of worse because I, like I realized halfway through that I told them the wrong direction, but I, I felt too embarrassed to correct myself. So I was like, oh yeah, the park is over that way to the left. And then they kind of stopped and they're like, okay. And then I had to keep going and adding more direct, like, and then I'm like, you take another left. And I was like, shit. Yeah, but I don't know anything else. That was a bad story. I would tell you about my Christmas vacation, but I don't think anything really crazy happened, but I'll try and recall. Nothing crazy happened for me. You fucking saw fucking water races of people. They're water people. Corey, that's a, that, that is very interesting. Not true. But what? That nothing interesting happened. We spent an hour and a half. They're different now because here's the thing. Yeah. And you think it's drugs, but what it is, it's they've, they've, their body is accustomed to the water and then they started taking this fucking like insulin, like drugs. And now their body is like, so their heroin and now they're taking methadone. And they were already taking like fucking like, like, um,

 SPEAKER_00 [1:06:54.014 --> 1:06:55.043]: 
  They go like

  No, they appreciate it. Alright, so anyway, he was in line for the bathroom. And don't ask me why there was a big red button exposed on the fucking plane. There shouldn't be a big red button exposed on the plane. But he was like kind of... The fuck are you talking about? I know, there was! He was pressing, like I saw him like kind of fidgeting around him. There's only two! Don't press the big red button. There's only two types of buttons. There's the call button for the person to come get your stuff. There's a button for... No, but this was near the... This is when he was in line for the bathroom. He was in line for the bathroom. This was on the wall, like opposite the door for the bathroom. Why? Is he just like pushing it? No, no, he was putting his hand all around it and stuff and like fidgeting with it. And I was like kind of like sweating because he was like... He's gonna press it, isn't he? And going like... I thought I was... The ejector seat for everything. I don't know. But then he came back to his seat and he was acting so fucking weird. Then he started doing like, he writing stuff on a piece of paper and stuff. And I was like, okay. And then that worried me too, but then I realized I was like... He's writing worried. You fucking racist. No, but I was writing and I was like, okay, if this plan was gonna explode, like, why would he write stuff? Because it would never survive. His will. Yeah, but to his merchants. Yeah, except it would be Ash. To his merchants. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, so I was like, okay. And then it turned out nothing happened. Like I guess, I or Stoy or whatever, but it scared the absolutely living fucking shit out of me. But... No, something did happen. I understand that. That's scary. Yeah, well that was like my only bad experience on a plan. My only bad experience I've ever had on a plane was just sitting next to a kid. That's the worst. No, it really pisses me off. On the planes. The fucking pillows. They're too small. And they're not existing. They're just like... We were saying when you were a kid how you were like... I couldn't fart smelling airplane pillows. Because that's what they do. They sit on them and fart and then they give them back to the people after they're done. Wait a minute. So they do. They wipe their fucking hands of the pillows and save it for the next guest. Get Pink Eye. Stink Eye too. Stink Eye for the Pinky Guy.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:04.497 --> 1:12:06.150]: 
  I know what it was!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:08.665 --> 1:12:10.977]: 
  I was like, no, don't press the big red one.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:16.647 --> 1:12:17.946]: 
  This was near the TV.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:32.172 --> 1:12:33.471]: 
  I thought I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:34.062 --> 1:12:35.479]: 
  I don't know

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:56.303 --> 1:12:58.345]: 
  his will to his virtue.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:59.475 --> 1:13:01.045]: 
  It's true. Yeah, go on.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:21.565 --> 1:13:22.493]: 
  You all really pissed me off.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:22.004 --> 1:13:23.185]: 
  This is my next one.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:26.813 --> 1:13:29.243]: 
  And they're not in the stand just like how we're saying much

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:48.379 --> 1:17:16.752]: 
  It's not anything. I know, sorry. But, yeah, wait. Did you ever watch Queer Eye for the straight guy? I hate that stupid fucking show. No, but what is it? I'll imagine it's just a bunch of guys going in and going, Hello! And they're like, You are wearing a terrible outfit. Oh my god. Let me match you up. There was a time where I just stopped watching MTV. Like, I used to watch MTV. There was like this one show where these like celebrities would come in and like, redo this guy's and like say like, We're gonna give you the best day of your life and they do a bunch of shit. I don't remember what that was called, but that was a show I used to watch really early. That was around the time when like Real World came out. Oh yeah, that's true. Real World came out. So it was like the start of that. Then you tune in now, it's like, I don't watch like these fucking Jersey show and all these terrible shows and shit. Yeah, but they were just, remember Made? MTV Made? No. There was this show called Made. And like, it would just be this fat loser in school and he'd be like, I want to be a wrestler. And then this guy like real, like Hulk Hogan comes in and like, I'm gonna teach you how to be a wrestler. That's what I'm talking about. These celebrities would come and like do something for him. But like, oh, I want to meet like Christian Bale and Christian Bale would come in. Yeah, except no, no, no, but the kid would be like, I want to be a bad man. And then like Christian Bale would come over and be like, So he'd be a bad man. Yeah, exactly. The poor kid will never, ever, ever. You know exactly, it's a joke. It's to make fun of like fucking Tubby Tommy and stuff. That's what a tour is. It's for to laugh at them because it shows them on the treadmill and then the personal trainer's like, run Tubby. And the guy's like, I can't do it anymore. They show it and they try to make drama and stuff. And they try to make genre. And literally it's just to laugh at them. You know what really pissed me off once? What? One time my sister was watching Super Sweet 16. But now it'll make you really pissed off anyways, because of how fucking retired these people are. But there was a part in the show where it was like, the girl was having a Super Sweet 16, right? Yeah. And then it showed these, this bunch of nerds at sight and they're trying to get in. You're like, you fucking nerds, what are you trying to get in there for? But then when the nerd tries getting in, he runs and a bouncer pushes him away. But then what really pissed me off was instead of playing like, it got a sound effect from the Sims of when the Sims to piss their pants. And it plays this like musical like, right, but except they left in the pissing sound effect. What? They just left it in like, you could hear like, water splashing on the floor. Chris, I can hear your autism in my ears. No, I'm like, You're fucking severe. Why wouldn't they at least cut out the end? How did you know that it was a pissed Sim sound? Because I played the Sims constantly when I was younger. I played something when you were the Sims. Like, because when I played the Sims, did you ever do that like fish eye code, a fish eye cheat? We could like see through Sims eyes. Oh, that must have been on the PS2 version. Yeah, yeah. I was always trying to like see through the very Sims. I had the Sims, the Sims living it up, the Sims house party, the Sims nightlife. I didn't have that one. We should talk about something that's not the Sims now. Hey, Corey, remember that time you told us about the Power Rangers kid? The Power Rangers kid. Can you talk about that to end this podcast? Yeah, because I guess people ask about that. I don't know if I left on a high note, kept the cliffhanger rolling, jumped the shark at that moment. I like the story. Basically, we knew this kid next door who always wanted to like hang out with us. And we were like too cool for school. We were playing DBZ and laughing it up. And he would be like, hey, I like the Power Rangers. We were like, yeah, I grew out of that idiot. We were jumping on trampoline, shooting our Kamehameha's being cool, and he'd come over and his Power Rangers tidy-wise all the time. And he would try to jump on us and be like, I'm the Red Ranger. And we would fucking kick him in the forehead and knock his stupid ass into the dog den. The dog would come all over him.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:52.497 --> 1:13:52.952]: 
  we're talking about.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:54.775 --> 1:13:56.682]: 
  I hate that stupid fucking show.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:59.044 --> 1:14:00.259]: 
  And they're all like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:14.670 --> 1:14:15.210]: 
  Oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:14:44.404 --> 1:14:45.940]: 
  I won't teach you how to be arrested!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:45.940 --> 1:14:46.682]: 
  That's what I'm talking about.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:48.589 --> 1:14:49.433]:

  and trampolines.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:17:44.494 --> 1:19:14.235]: 
  What? Well we went over there once and he was, we went over there once, me and my friend Dylan, and he was like doing like a, he pulled a shirt over his head and he fucking pulled his pants down and he did a Power Rangers dance, completely naked with his like fucking eight year old dick hanging out. And you know, and then we were like grossed or gay and then we ran home and, and we had popsicles, but Dylan took the last fucking popsicle I wanted. So I was stuck with, that's what I remember. I forgot about the dick part and I was so mad that, that fucking Dylan took the fucking strawberry popsicle and I had to be stuck with shitty grape and that motherfucker, I completely forgot about it. I remember like he was doing like some like YMCA dance with his fucking shirt over his head and his dick hanging out, but I more remember the popsicle thing. You remember more about the popsicles than you do about the baby dick. Cause that was the last time I had cherry popsicles in a while. I hate cherry.
