  the Sleepycast season finale featuring Stamper, Rice Pirate, Oni, Psychic Pibbles, Spaz Kid, Nile, Johnny Utah, and Tom Fulp. My name is not really Captain Dickhead. I have been living a lie. All my stories, everything I've ever said. It is a lie. One day the truth will be revealed. But not today. I have a doctor's appointment. Because my peepee is coming out like cottage cheese. See you in another life!

  tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable descent.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:00:47.444 --> 0:00:50.498]: 
  A world enveloped by a seemingly unending

 SPEAKER_04 [0:00:50.498 --> 0:01:01.264]: 
  The leading ocean of forests buried deep in that forest, tucked away neatly within a blanket of twilight, lies a quaint little cabin. And in that cabin...

 SPEAKER_06 [0:01:18.308 --> 0:01:29.564]:

 SPEAKER_04 [0:01:29.564 --> 0:01:34.440]: 
  and Sasquatch. Enter the domain of the North American Sasquatch.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:01:34.440 --> 0:01:55.011]: 
  Towering nearly one and a half inches over the typical brownstone Sasquatch. S-wait, Sasquatch? Or Sasquatch? Fine, whatever. Tune in next week as Discovery takes you deep within the vicious web of sex, lies and drugs that is the secret world of the North American Sanct Squatch. Only on Discovery. After Hours.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:08.804 --> 0:05:12.752]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:51.615 --> 0:05:57.994]: 
  Alright, I found new grounds through an ego raptor video

 SPEAKER_06 [0:05:57.994 --> 0:06:08.811]: 
  posted on YouTube that said stop watching Mike Cartiens on YouTube go to Newgrounds because it's better. John Tooby asked who do you hope to have on season 2 of the podcast? Stamper?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:03.107 --> 0:06:04.440]: 
  John Toobeee asks

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:10.954 --> 0:06:18.497]: 
  Ohhh! dieser!步긋! Oh my God.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:06:18.497 --> 0:06:23.695]: 
  The speed of which that fucking answer came out

 SPEAKER_06 [0:06:22.395 --> 0:06:52.450]: 
  answer came out. That was amazing. Amazing. You know I was moving on. Fuck the rest of that question. Moving on. Travis Powell asks, if an investor approached Sleepy Cabin and gave you guys $500,000 check but wanted a 5% stake in the company, would you take it and what would you do with it if you did? Take the money, shut down the company, let's start a new company. Buy a resident.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:26.445 --> 0:06:28.133]: 
  Amazing!

 SPEAKER_04 [0:06:50.492 --> 0:06:59.942]: 
  Let's start a new company. Buy a Resident Evil mansion. Call Kevin Sleepy. It's like flipping houses. Start a new Patreon.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:06:52.281 --> 0:06:57.293]: 
  It's called Kevin Sleepy. It's like flipping houses. You just keep playing.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:06:59.942 --> 0:07:45.049]: 
  one running and just stack them up. Is that what you guys were talking about? I would like to think the real answer would be we'd probably do a couple animated series that would actually make content. It's going to be like tiredhouse.com. I think actually what I would do is I would tell him a series of questions. Catch him off guard to see if he actually was truly a sleepy Kevin fan. Wait, what? No, who cares if he's a fan? He just gave you a $500,000 check. If he knew about sleepy Kevin it's just not something he said a fan out of it. The other question is are you going to take it if somebody wants 5%? I know, I would tell him. I think everybody says yes. This is what I would say. I was going to say Chris you can't spend on the money and you're resident evil. Yeah, it's not fair. You can spend half of it. I would really want to make a cartoon. You can build half of the mansion. I would really see the real in a cartoon. Yeah, I think we would probably do a couple series. $500,000.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:02.119 --> 0:07:03.199]: 
  I love you guys.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:07:09.477 --> 0:07:10.371]: 
  I think actually

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:11.316 --> 0:07:13.594]: 
  I would tell him a series of questions.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:30.030 --> 0:07:33.135]: 
  I know, I would tell him. I think everybody says yes. This is what I would say.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:07:36.004 --> 0:07:38.451]: 
  Yeah, it's not fair. You can spend that. I would really want to...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:37.810 --> 0:07:37.844]: 
  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:38.451 --> 0:07:39.936]: 
  You can build half of the mansion.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:39.936 --> 0:07:41.522]: 
  I would really see all the characters.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:07:43.885 --> 0:07:48.509]: 
  500,000 dollars. It's like a really arbitrary number. Like why would anybody be like, here's...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:44.509 --> 0:07:44.948]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:46.973 --> 0:07:51.175]: 
  Why would anybody be like, here's half a million? And I want 5% of the time.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:07:49.892 --> 0:08:07.898]: 
  I assume he's a creepy rich kid like he's a rich dad or something. I would bring him into a dark room where light is shining on him and I would ask him does my dad fuck me. And then start chopping off his fingers with pliers. If he didn't give me the answer, I'd be like, why the hell? I'd buy a capture card and start let's playing and make triple that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:07:52.002 --> 0:07:53.504]: 
  I would, I would

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:53.504 --> 0:07:53.622]: 
  Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:07:56.609 --> 0:07:56.997]: 
  Does he?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:57.992 --> 0:08:03.443]: 
  Then start chopping off his fingers

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:03.443 --> 0:08:03.494]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [0:08:03.494 --> 0:08:04.540]: 
  That would be the answer.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:08:09.113 --> 0:08:17.449]: 
  What day you'd start so you're basically saying with $500,000 you'd start a Minecraft let's play chess. Yes, all right moving on

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:14.361 --> 0:08:15.002]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:15.002 --> 0:08:22.579]: 
  Alright, alright, moving on! So he would keep all the money and then just start playing. And make more! There you go, that's right.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:17.449 --> 0:08:19.440]: 
  So he would keep all the money and then just

 SPEAKER_06 [0:08:19.440 --> 0:08:38.357]: 
  and make more. That's right. Nathan Brown asks, not that Sleepy Cabin has been going for almost a year. How do you dashing guys feel about the growth and work of Sleepy Cabin? Has working together helped you guys grow as content producers? No.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:37.902 --> 0:08:42.441]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:08:42.441 --> 0:08:43.504]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:12.006 --> 0:09:12.698]: 
  Anyways.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:14.250 --> 0:09:14.993]:

 SPEAKER_06 [0:09:36.104 --> 0:09:44.372]: 
  It's not you spit and no, I really have no meaning anything. It's I haven't made any it has no validity So I think here's what's ironic

 SPEAKER_07 [0:09:37.082 --> 0:09:38.449]: 
  bit into the sink.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:38.449 --> 0:09:39.529]: 
  No meaning to it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:41.115 --> 0:09:41.504]: 
  It has

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:41.504 --> 0:09:45.368]: 
  There's no validity to it. So I think, here's what's ironic is that we've got

 SPEAKER_06 [0:09:45.368 --> 0:10:17.937]: 
  Jeff and Corey who both have been working on a game with Tom Fulp. We have Zach and Chris who both have been working on Hellbenders. We have Nile who's been working on half of the ladies in Philadelphia and outside of the state. And then we've got... Most of Black? Most of Black. Yeah, Stamper and me who have also been working on some other stuff. So while we have Sleepy Cabin, we chose a time to start this when everybody was working on these huge other fucking projects. It was basically like, hey, let's start a podcast while we're all super invested in something. We're all drowning in work. Next, we got Jace Baker.

  Like you did amazing things

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:22.947 --> 0:12:26.558]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:26.440 --> 0:12:28.617]: 
  He was a pedophile, I don't know, anyway, he's moving on.

  I have a lot of sarcasm maybe

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:30.557 --> 0:12:39.822]: 
  We just don't know much people wouldn't even know what to think. Yeah, yeah, yeah. People would just think, yeah, just... I don't think you can include sarcasm in a book because people don't really understand sarcasm. I don't know how else to...

 SPEAKER_07 [0:12:32.751 --> 0:12:35.468]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, it looks like, I don't think you're gonna,

 SPEAKER_06 [0:12:38.759 --> 0:12:51.516]: 
  I don't know how else to speak. It's like the Chinese language is so literal that it's like hard to be sarcastic. If somebody asked me to write a biography, I would fill in the stuff that they didn't really know what stuff I thought. You would write their life like a movie. Well they would tell me stuff.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:12:39.822 --> 0:12:42.944]: 
  It's like the Chinese language, it's so literal that it's like hard to be certain.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:42.944 --> 0:12:43.500]: 
  There's somebody else.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:50.453 --> 0:12:57.507]: 
  Well they would tell me stuff. Oh you would be like the frosting in between layers of cake. Yeah. I was gonna say. You would have something. Just making up bullshit all the way.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:12:52.934 --> 0:12:53.997]: 
  Layers of cake.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:53.997 --> 0:12:54.942]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:12:54.992 --> 0:13:07.007]: 
  Just making a bullshit all the way. I was born and raised on a farm with my father until the spaceship came to pick us up. So you'd lie? Nile, who would you have right your biography? I'd say uh...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:01.928 --> 0:13:03.497]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:17.284 --> 0:13:20.305]: 
  I absolutely would not have to go to fucking go

  over the fucking Irish hills and talk to your parents. Would you do that? Who would fucking yell at me? You wouldn't do that. I would do it if you died, okay? This is nice.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:13:27.780 --> 0:13:42.006]: 
  Chris who Chris who do you have right now? I'd have Cory because he'd make shit up and he'd make everything stupid and it'd be funny It would be funny. It would be funny something about these assholes Cory say weird shit like I came from the land of sand or something and that would be it

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:36.100 --> 0:13:36.370]: 
  something

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:37.011 --> 0:13:38.395]: 
  Do you want to say weird shit?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:42.006 --> 0:13:47.507]: 
  He was bored and letting you say it would just be a fairy tale. Yeah, dude water people and

 SPEAKER_04 [0:13:42.377 --> 0:13:45.887]: 
  It would just be a fairy tale.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:13:46.950 --> 0:13:54.764]:

 SPEAKER_06 [0:16:30.992 --> 0:17:07.999]: 
  either Stamper or Chris write my bios only because Stamper knows a whole lot of fucking shit that's happened in my life in a short amount of time. Does he? Yeah. And Chris would write it. Do you want science fiction for true? Does anybody know anything about you? Yeah, well. You're not mysterious now. I think it's guys. Do you want racist stereotypes? And Chris would write probably the funniest biography only because like there'd be no punctuation and there'd be lots of misspelled words like then he crunks on the grunk or whatever and he just misspell everything just like his scripts that he says to us. I love writing scripts like that. You know what?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:41.792 --> 0:16:42.872]:

  scripts like that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:08.994 --> 0:17:10.497]: 
  That question was like a really

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:10.310 --> 0:17:19.525]: 
  a roundabout way of saying who do you trust the most? No, that's not true. I was thinking that's never a no. That's not true at all. That's exactly what that question means. No, because-

 SPEAKER_07 [0:17:13.348 --> 0:17:16.436]: 
  No, that's not true. I was thinking that, Samper. No.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:16.436 --> 0:17:18.394]: 
  That's exactly what I was asking.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:17:18.394 --> 0:17:23.321]: 
  No, because I believe that a lot of you guys would trust me. No, that question is...

 SPEAKER_07 [0:17:22.461 --> 0:17:32.080]: 
  No, that question is exactly like who would you kill first in reverse? That's exactly what that question means. I wouldn't do this. This isn't even true. I wouldn't try to see.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:17:29.616 --> 0:17:38.999]: 
  I wouldn't do this. It's not true. I would trust you and Stamper. But if I said, look, I need one of you to like put a bullet in me. Yeah. I'm just Stamper. No, yeah. No.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:21:28.364 --> 0:22:27.527]: 
  Okay, I woke up. I went to the post office. I had a package to send to my mom on my way to The post office a guy stopped me in the street and said hey Did you hear the towers got hit and I literally did not process it and just thought the guy was crazy It's New York. You never know and I was like yeah, yeah, okay, whatever I went to post office. I sent my package No one at the post office seemed to have any kind of reaction at all and on my way back There were there were some people that I don't know I guess it's kind of like you know things felt a little weird But like I didn't really really anticipate anything. I got to Pretty much to our building and there was a bunch of people standing outside They're on their phones and everybody was trying to make phone calls and I asked what was going on And they said that the twin towers got hit and I said what what I mean I guess like when they say you're just like what does that mean like got hit? Yeah, what do you mean? Yeah, and then some yeah, I got hit by hacker. Yeah, or something

 SPEAKER_04 [0:22:10.585 --> 0:22:11.091]: 
  And you're on the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:23.072 --> 0:22:29.333]: 
  It got hit like a lot. Yeah, like what do you mean? Yeah, and then somebody's like... Yeah, it got hit by hackers or something. Yeah, or somebody and then somebody said, no, a plane flew into it. I was like, oh, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:26.447 --> 0:22:27.004]: 
  Yeah, or something like that.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:22:29.333 --> 0:22:32.995]: 
  Oh shit, that's fucking crazy in there. Like yeah, you can see it from the roof. And I was like, oh shit.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:32.809 --> 0:22:38.445]: 
  Shit, so I was like okay at that point. It was just like oh the the talent was a yeah

 SPEAKER_06 [0:22:36.994 --> 0:23:43.971]: 
  the Taros got hit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I went up and I was living with two film guys, Adrian and, Adrian Elsie and Ben Baker and they were both film guys. And I went upstairs and Ben was smoking Adrian wasn't there, he did whatever he wanted. Ben was a big pothead back then. He still may be, Ben Baker, Lee. Anyways, I woke him up and I said, hey dude, I heard the Taros got hit and you can see it from the roof which you go up. And he's like, what are you talking about? Anyways, he woke up and he brought his camera up and we went up and all the people in our building which we very rarely saw. It was a converted warehouse textile factory which was then turned into a bunch of lofts. 248 McKibbin Street. Anyone in New York who knows that it's there. Anyways, it's off the Montrose stop and we went up to the roof and there was just everybody. Everybody was up on the roof of the building and they all had their phones out and everyone was trying to make phone calls and no one could get through to anything. But what was really creepy is that you're across the river so you can actually look across into Manhattan. You could just see one of the towers and just smoke coming out of it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:22:38.445 --> 0:22:39.492]: 
  Yeah, so I went up.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:23:44.562 --> 0:23:54.501]: 
  It was pretty creepy iconic image. Yeah, well, it was one of the iconic images It was both of them were still standing at the time. Yeah, and only what was at this point of a career. Yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:53.050 --> 0:23:55.952]: 
  Yeah, yeah, only one was it. Oh, you got there before the second one was it?

 SPEAKER_06 [0:23:55.649 --> 0:24:07.444]: 
  Yeah, so everyone instead the first one hit and then by that time I got home and went upstairs and we saw it and then While we were up there somebody brought up a television because none of our shit was fucking working

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:07.444 --> 0:24:12.220]: 
  No one can make phone calls and all the lines were like

 SPEAKER_06 [0:24:08.052 --> 0:24:08.069]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:10.701 --> 0:24:10.718]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_06 [0:24:10.718 --> 0:24:32.892]: 
  All the lines were like I believe this is what I believe I was telling Stanford this earlier was that the cellular tower was on top of The twin towers I believe that was the case I'm not sure as a one where people still has people had so much, but was it like a huge thing water people had him at that point Yeah, a lot of people had him at that but it wasn't it wasn't as accessible. We all have that flip shit. There was no like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:22.007 --> 0:24:22.834]: 
  I'm not sure.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:30.985 --> 0:24:31.170]: 
  that

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:31.795 --> 0:24:31.997]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:31.997 --> 0:24:33.938]: 
  There was no smart phones.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:24:32.504 --> 0:24:35.625]: 
  like smart. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:33.027 --> 0:24:34.410]: 
  He's like flit knocking.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:24:34.410 --> 0:24:59.099]: 
  I'm just gonna say, well, you know. Yeah, so, but anyways, we were up there and no one could make phone calls and one of the towers was hit. Ben brought up his camera and someone brought up a television and then tenant television and they had the local news going on, which is interesting because like pixel for pixel, what you saw on the horizon versus what you saw, yeah, on the actual television was pretty much relative.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:24:55.234 --> 0:24:55.875]: 
  This is what you see.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:59.099 --> 0:25:05.528]: 
  and then the second one well every every every with basically everything after the first one hit so we saw the first

 SPEAKER_06 [0:25:05.528 --> 0:26:11.678]: 
  shower go down, we also saw the second one hit. And when all that was happening, I just remember everyone trying to call people. And Stepra and I were actually talking about like post-apocalyptic movies where like, how do people feel like the world is ending? And we always see like, you know, people hanging from a lamp post or people shooting themselves or whatever. But the truth is, the way it really fucking hits you is when you're self-enlightened. You try to fucking call someone. Yeah, when you try to call someone or your internet doesn't work. And they're not in your phone. Because like, all of a sudden, you can't contact anybody. You feel isolated. So fucking isolated. Here I was with like, six people. Nobody remembers phone numbers anymore. Oh yeah, even if you had the phone, you couldn't call anybody. But it's like, here you are trying to call like your parents or whatever to let them know you're all right or whatever. And like, you don't have cell service, you don't have internet, you don't have any of this fucking shit. There's no better way to make people feel isolated than take away that. Because it's weird because it takes down your communication from the world down to a block. And you're so used to it. Down to the top of the world.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:30.587 --> 0:25:32.899]: 
  You've already fucking called

 SPEAKER_07 [0:25:34.350 --> 0:25:35.295]: 
  They're not your-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:40.240 --> 0:25:43.480]: 
  Isolated so fucking isolated like here. I would

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:44.239 --> 0:25:48.593]: 
  Even with a payphone, nobody remembers phone numbers anymore.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:50.331 --> 0:25:50.753]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:55.495 --> 0:25:56.524]: 
  And like you don't

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:56.001 --> 0:25:56.069]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:09.906 --> 0:26:13.939]: 
  And you're so used to it. You can't tweet it, you can't Facebook it, you can't call somebody.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:26:13.939 --> 0:26:17.449]: 
  can't text somebody you're literally like yourself who is yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:15.357 --> 0:26:28.334]: 
  literally just like who's yeah who who's next to me if you ask me like the second tower just went down lol yeah no you'd probably take a photo and put on instagram at a filter

 SPEAKER_06 [0:26:18.765 --> 0:26:18.985]: 
  if

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:18.985 --> 0:26:20.504]: 
  And we're all sharing the experience.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:26.309 --> 0:26:29.835]: 
  and then you get like a movie. Oh yeah, no they weren't.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:26:28.334 --> 0:26:45.951]: 
  Oh yeah, no they weren't.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:45.951 --> 0:26:49.005]: 
  thought it was an accident and what what what what what what what

 SPEAKER_06 [0:26:49.005 --> 0:27:58.885]: 
  What point did it dot on you when the second tower got hit everyone? I think everybody knew and not only that but we had like I said We had the TV up there. Yeah, and once the second tower Immediately, I mean how how media was it before you? Um, it was it was fairly clear, but it wasn't exactly Crystallized until hang on yeah So what happened was is that we were looking at a screen that had the twin towers hit and then all of a sudden the Screen on the newest went split screen and they showed the Pentagon as soon as we saw the Pentagon with a plane hitting the side of it Everybody on the roof was like yeah fuck Half the roof cleared out and ran down and got water It's it was like as soon as that fucking happened There was no fucking question and at that point I actually started I have a tape somewhere in my boxes It's called black Tuesday, and it's just a cassette tape where I just popped it into one of our stereos And I press record as the news was playing it was just was you reacting to it? No not me at all Oh, you were close you record. I just recorded like radio stations, okay? So it was like your favorite rock band radio station press record during 9-11 in New York And it was like all of these guys, you know that was exactly what I was

  No, not me at all.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:56.843 --> 0:28:06.951]: 
  Dude, no, that was exactly what everything was. Everything was dedicated to it. Yeah, I know that. I remember I was sleeping on the couch and my dad called me and he said

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:00.269 --> 0:28:01.787]: 
  Everything was dedicated to it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:28:06.495 --> 0:28:14.494]: 
  he said, turn on the TV. I said, okay, what station? He said, it doesn't matter. And I was like, oh my God, even in our back.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:08.504 --> 0:28:08.892]:

 SPEAKER_07 [0:41:49.911 --> 0:41:56.003]:

  No, I didn't. Oh, really? I had no idea this was a thing.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:42:06.550 --> 0:42:20.691]: 
  Oh no, this is a real thing. No, um, and uh, so like it's really hard for me to actually get motivation and stuff because I just can't think of like one thing for more than five seconds. A lot of people have this problem. Yeah, see, that's the thing. You can't beat yourself up ever, but I feel like...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:42:15.224 --> 0:42:17.029]: 
  A lot of people have this problem.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:20.539 --> 0:42:27.947]: 
  Everybody has problems especially when it comes to creative shit. Yeah, so you can't like everybody feels bad about everything they do

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:24.336 --> 0:42:24.859]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:27.947 --> 0:42:29.955]: 
  and it's always like this. And I'll say this too.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:28.825 --> 0:42:28.842]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_06 [0:42:28.842 --> 0:43:03.537]: 
  I'll say this too, maybe if you're not you know, everyone has a weak spot with creativity So maybe you're really good at creating. Oh, that's true. Yeah, maybe maybe you're super good at thinking about this But maybe you're not gonna execute that's so that's so true It's so everyone has a soft spot So maybe you see people who you see all of us who seem like really we were creative creative and fun We all have weak spots whether it's like timing or like getting stuff out on time Yeah, getting stuff done doing If you feel stressed out it's it's easy to get burnt out if you feel stressed out the world actually step away Not weak whatever you're gonna be weak if you fucking burn yourself out you can't wait for two you can't work for two weeks

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:35.440 --> 0:42:36.554]:

  Thank you, bye.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:39.760 --> 0:42:40.671]: 
  That's so true.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:46.155 --> 0:42:46.493]: 
  Un LS

 SPEAKER_01 [0:42:46.493 --> 0:42:48.029]: 
  We all have...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:52.517 --> 0:42:53.817]: 
  No, it is.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:03.486 --> 0:43:27.499]: 
  I'll say this, if you're sitting at home beating yourself up every day because you feel like you're not a good voice actor, day after day, then maybe you shouldn't be a voice actor, maybe you could keep doing it, but maybe you were meant for something else. Yeah, yeah, explore all your ears. It's not to say that you, why pigeonhole yourself, there's no reason to pigeonhole yourself into a specific career. The world has changed and the world constantly changed. By the way, the world is...

 SPEAKER_07 [0:43:16.733 --> 0:43:17.492]: 
  explore all of them.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:17.492 --> 0:43:18.049]: 
  To save it.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:43:27.499 --> 0:43:38.957]: 
  It's it's certainly now is the time where you can change it allows you to yeah None of us none of us are single singularly voice actors or singularly I mean Jeff really your voice actor games are an animated coin you're a fucking it is weird. Oh, yeah

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:31.279 --> 0:43:31.752]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:43:37.877 --> 0:43:47.985]: 
  It is weird. You know, you don't have to point at a star and say, I'm going to be a web designer for the rest of my life and lock yourself into this. I will say it to you though. This is kind of on topic, but.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:43:44.492 --> 0:43:52.947]: 
  That's insane though. This is kind of on topic, but when you get to a certain age, you sort of realize there's certain professions, it's just impossible.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:43:52.947 --> 0:43:55.005]: 
  possible like I can't be a political

 SPEAKER_06 [0:43:53.554 --> 0:43:54.179]: 
  Like

 SPEAKER_06 [0:43:55.005 --> 0:44:08.944]: 
  Lee's officer now. I can't fly fighter jets now. Just saying. You could. That's the thing Jeff, like you could. See I got that feeling when I found out there was like 12 year old golfers that were getting better scores than Tiger Woods and I was like, wow.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:43:58.600 --> 0:44:01.452]: 
  You could. That's the thing Jeff, like you could. See, I got to.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:01.452 --> 0:44:02.430]: 
  That's really what I found.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:08.556 --> 0:44:11.138]: 
  I think it's all you never ever do that

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:08.708 --> 0:44:14.952]: 
  I think it's all you can definitely be a police officer because most of them are douchebags and it's pretty easy to get a job right.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:44:13.433 --> 0:44:19.440]: 
  You'd be the best, you'd be the most in shape without further ado.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:14.952 --> 0:44:19.845]: 
  You be the most in shape without further ado because your eyesight is bad

 SPEAKER_06 [0:44:19.272 --> 0:44:31.506]: 
  Yeah, my eyesight stinks, but I'm just saying things people get into in their early 20s and train hard and you're just like, I don't know, you sort of cross that bridge and you're just like, I fucked up.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:29.582 --> 0:44:39.944]: 
  But this is the transitional generational period where you don't have to train hard for one specific walk of life Yeah, you just got to break your ass

 SPEAKER_06 [0:44:34.544 --> 0:44:34.847]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:44:36.788 --> 0:44:46.170]: 
  I'm just saying. Yeah, you just gotta break your ass for all of it. Some people still do it instead when they're still having a meal with you. You're funny and creative. You can do any number of things. That also opens up the other.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:41.952 --> 0:44:43.133]: 
  You're funny and creative.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:44.669 --> 0:44:49.815]: 
  That also opens up the other door where people think they are. Yeah, it's not working out very well.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:44:48.111 --> 0:45:03.552]: 
  Yeah, and it's not working out very well with too much confidence out there that are worthless You know what and there's people with too much confidence to actually get really successful based on them Just being confident if you're if you're motivated and confident you don't need talent. Yeah, no, that's actually correct

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:52.110 --> 0:44:54.085]: 
  You know what? And there's people with too much...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:58.202 --> 0:44:59.097]: 
  Kampen, echt.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:45:01.645 --> 0:45:01.949]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:45:01.949 --> 0:45:02.775]: 
  No!

 SPEAKER_07 [0:45:03.484 --> 0:45:19.937]: 
  But Jeff like the thing with me is that I vowed never to work in retail or fast food ever again I would rather be homeless and like okay jokes I would rather I would rather not have a job then

 SPEAKER_06 [0:45:12.462 --> 0:45:13.694]: 
  I'm the same way.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:45:17.035 --> 0:45:17.963]: 
  Like wrong.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:45:18.604 --> 0:45:24.578]:

  Me Chris I can't remember who uses exactly

 SPEAKER_07 [0:45:45.267 --> 0:45:53.282]:

  That's less driving. They put that couple of notes. That was, like, that caught a little deep. But at the same time, I thought it was just fucking true, but okay. It was just traffic. Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's true. I'm here. No, no, it's true. It is true. I'm just kidding. I was just, like, slagging, Mick. But the thing that happened was I started this YouTube channel called MasterSpaghetti. I got, like, 60,000, like, subscribers or something. I was, like, nuts at the time. Then this other guy called, he kind of ripped me off. He stole my videos. But my videos were stolen anyway. They were called, like, I just, like, I just stole them, like, cringey videos because I used to look them up at the time. And we called it Crin channel. And, um...

 SPEAKER_06 [0:47:01.980 --> 0:47:06.992]: 
  I thought it was Jimmy fucking true, but okay. Whatever. Wait, wait, wait, it's true.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:47:02.942 --> 0:47:03.499]: 
  It's true, but...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:32.777 --> 0:47:35.072]: 
  What was your definition of a cringey video?

 SPEAKER_07 [0:47:35.072 --> 0:47:40.995]: 
  Just a video where it's like really hard to watch, you need to pause it halfway through to be like, oh my god. What are you talking about?

 SPEAKER_06 [0:47:37.570 --> 0:47:43.999]: 
  You should have been halfway through to be like, oh my god. What are you talking about? The magi is stuff we've ever done. And then after that, um,

 SPEAKER_07 [0:47:42.582 --> 0:47:44.708]: 
  And then after that, um,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:43.999 --> 0:47:46.244]: 
  What's the cringiest thing you saw on the internet?

 SPEAKER_06 [0:47:44.708 --> 0:47:44.725]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_07 [0:47:46.514 --> 0:47:53.500]: 
  Yeah, yeah, then after that redded cringe was made, or cringe and uh... Yeah, the rest of it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:52.015 --> 0:47:52.859]: 
  So why did you...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:53.500 --> 0:47:56.099]: 
  the suffering of other human beings.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:47:56.082 --> 0:47:59.237]: 
  At the time no one else did that and, um, suffering.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:47:57.499 --> 0:48:01.937]: 
  and people suffering, people uploading videos of their own like a lot of

 SPEAKER_06 [0:48:01.937 --> 0:48:07.995]: 
  People just made videos of themselves. I made asses of themselves. It was their choice

 SPEAKER_07 [0:48:05.785 --> 0:48:10.122]: 
  It was there too, I'm so full of it. However, I do feel about it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:07.995 --> 0:48:14.948]: 
  I do feel a bad boat. But the public backlash is their suffering and you contribute to that so it's all human suffering.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:48:14.948 --> 0:48:20.162]: 
  or you're promoting. Yeah, you gotta think of it both ways. I do feel, but no, the promoting thing is not...

 SPEAKER_07 [0:48:17.867 --> 0:48:21.327]: 
  I do feel but not the promoting thing is not something that I know what

 SPEAKER_04 [0:48:20.162 --> 0:48:20.770]: 
  not something that

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:20.770 --> 0:48:26.423]: 
  You know what? I think of it as bully, bully and bully. I didn't do shit, I watched it, that's all I did.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:48:25.950 --> 0:48:34.692]: 
  No, it's bully. It is bully and that's why I didn't want to monetize it Um, but then the guy who ran it with me wanted to monetize it You watch crazy shit The most cringy

 SPEAKER_01 [0:48:30.439 --> 0:48:33.072]: 
  But then the guy who ran it with me wanted to watch.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:48:33.072 --> 0:48:40.800]: 
  The most cringiest thing I ever saw on the internet is any video where I actually show myself as like a like any time I do like my lips

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:40.800 --> 0:48:45.458]: 
  make things or any kind of like update video where it's me. Oh, no, no, absolutely.

  I can't listen to podcasts with me in them so I guess I do

  I'm tired of you talking about me. We're done, we're done with this.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:24.237 --> 0:49:32.505]: 
  You mean like the sunglasses that you normally wear? No, they would be cool. Nice hoodie, bag it! Anyways, this guy called him like a real- Damn dude.

  Anyway.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:49:32.505 --> 0:49:39.492]: 
  over like this chick to look at his house and he bites her and he's like a video clip the whole time. I found that originally. Yeah, he's like so.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:49:35.627 --> 0:49:38.462]: 
  I found that originally yes

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:39.492 --> 0:49:44.436]: 
  He keeps asking your quiz like basically he's dragging it all. Oh my god, I just wanted to

 SPEAKER_07 [0:49:42.327 --> 0:49:45.938]: 
  Draggy hole. Oh my god. I was one of the original fighters of this video.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:49:45.938 --> 0:49:49.954]: 
  No intention, absolutely no intention of actually buying the house or looking at it. Okay, so this guy, this guy-

 SPEAKER_07 [0:49:48.486 --> 0:50:01.379]: 
  Okay, so this guy this guy this guy looks like a 90s serial rapist and He what he does is he goes what he goes what he does is he goes to like realtors that are women And he tries to hit on them and carry on

 SPEAKER_06 [0:50:01.379 --> 0:50:17.393]: 
  Yeah, so essentially like he makes like an Auschwitz joke a little point She does he's got a kind of nervous thing laughing because this guy's a fucking like cam corner So who's filming it? Himself! He's got this! So how do you know what he looks like if he's filming himself? He turns himself into a camera on himself Wow, that is doubly cringy

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:08.466 --> 0:50:11.149]: 
  himself. He's like this.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:50:11.993 --> 0:50:12.060]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:12.060 --> 0:50:16.937]: 
  He's filming himself. He turns the camera on himself. Wow, that is doubly cringy.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:16.937 --> 0:50:18.524]: 
  The reason he recorded this is because he's

 SPEAKER_06 [0:50:18.524 --> 0:50:39.027]: 
  He thought he was picking up the woman and by the way at the very end he likes but have your wife He's like oh yeah, this would be a good place for my wife and I at the very end. He's like I don't like my wife She's like, okay, let's uh she gets super busy we're comfortable. Yeah, I had to pause it probably 30 times I couldn't watch all of it. I actually originally found that video. That's why it's that's probably the worst one look I try to look it up. I don't know what it's called. Oh, it's kind of shocking

 SPEAKER_07 [0:50:33.374 --> 0:50:34.217]: 
  I actually

 SPEAKER_07 [0:50:34.859 --> 0:50:36.040]: 
  video that's quite a

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:35.517 --> 0:50:35.939]: 
  Let's play that.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:50:37.896 --> 0:50:39.600]: 
  This was kind of shocking. Why do you go?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:38.993 --> 0:50:40.444]: 
  Why do you go out of your way to-

 SPEAKER_06 [0:50:40.444 --> 0:51:00.812]: 
  Watch it you I think a lot of it is to do it with a ability Yeah, you feel like you're that guy is yeah like there's videos where I'd be watching it Like where a kid would upload himself to like YouTube at when you're doing he'll make a complete ass of himself It was a the spider. Yeah, you can sit there and be I looked like that kid I could have been that kid. I had the internet years before

 SPEAKER_04 [0:50:43.482 --> 0:50:44.444]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:50:45.389 --> 0:50:46.131]: 
  Yeah, like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:50.147 --> 0:50:50.822]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:52.375 --> 0:50:54.720]: 
  We'll say the Spiders

 SPEAKER_07 [0:50:57.876 --> 0:51:00.002]: 
  See, if I had the internet years before...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:00.002 --> 0:51:08.001]: 
  That is such horseshit. It's not horseshit. People watch cringe videos to say, Look at what that asshole did. I'm so much better than he is. Yeah, that's like definitely a lot of shit.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:00.441 --> 0:51:02.500]: 
  This is such horseshit. It's not horseshit.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:06.364 --> 0:51:08.744]: 
  Oh yeah, that's like definitely a lot of it.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:51:08.001 --> 0:51:19.746]: 
  But he's saying it's the I dodge that bullet. Yeah, there's a lot of seriously I could have easily have been that easily could have been me comedy bombing videos are funny because they're come the comedians are

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:14.042 --> 0:51:15.004]: 
  There's so many things.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:15.004 --> 0:51:16.928]: 
  Things like that easily could have been me.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:51:19.611 --> 0:51:23.442]: 
  are usually assholes and they deserve it and you're like yeah. You watch them implode

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:22.109 --> 0:51:24.640]: 
  You watch them implode?

 SPEAKER_06 [0:51:23.442 --> 0:51:27.239]: 
  A lot of those videos satisfying because they're making asses of themselves

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:27.239 --> 0:51:30.006]: 
  I want to wipe the screen of that man. What?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:30.006 --> 0:51:36.520]: 
  Yeah, this is really hard. I guess that's the cringe part. It's hard for me to watch. Yeah

 SPEAKER_07 [0:51:34.461 --> 0:51:34.950]: 
  노고 altogether!

 SPEAKER_06 [0:51:34.950 --> 0:51:40.958]: 
  I'll say this too like cringe is like an evolved trait for sympathy. Yeah, no it is

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:39.709 --> 0:51:52.821]: 
  No, it is it is the ultimate absolutely that is the biggest crocus shit If you cringe is because you were sympathizing

 SPEAKER_07 [0:51:44.738 --> 0:51:46.442]: 
  No!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:46.442 --> 0:51:47.438]: 
  Reason why you said that?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:51:47.438 --> 0:51:48.872]: 
  No!

 SPEAKER_06 [0:51:50.678 --> 0:52:16.952]: 
  That's all it is. That doesn't do with the fact that you want to watch it. I actually agree with that. No, I will say, listen, this is 100% serious. I feel like the time where I cannot watch something is when someone else is really uncomfortable in the position. Like, if some fucking creepy autistic is bothering someone who clearly isn't interested, that makes me uncomfortable. Because that person's like, get the fuck away from me, but he's just, this idiot doesn't stand his social que.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:51:55.403 --> 0:51:56.939]: 
  That's what I heard.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:55.437 --> 0:51:55.943]: 
  That's a

 SPEAKER_04 [0:51:58.238 --> 0:51:59.402]: 
  I can't argue with that.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:52:15.315 --> 0:52:19.129]: 
  It doesn't see me social cues you guys have no problem watching these videos. I'm saying I don't

 SPEAKER_06 [0:52:19.129 --> 0:52:35.363]: 
  You know what? I don't mind seeing an autistic implode on himself, but I do mind when said autistic is imploding on someone who doesn't want to see it. I don't know what you're talking about. This is another factor.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:27.719 --> 0:52:30.925]: 
  I don't know what you're talking about. Look, this is another factor.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:52:33.591 --> 0:52:37.860]: 
  He's saying the videos were

 SPEAKER_06 [0:52:36.274 --> 0:53:21.449]: 
  Yeah, if someone like creepy like someone like with like toys and stuff What I was like I really think you're pretty and want to give this to you and the person's like get the fuck away from me That makes me uncomfortable. Another thing is I don't laugh at that The first time you watch like Chris Chen that is the first like that you'll cringe the first time right by himself No, I know right, but you'll cringe the first time But then you'll watch the next thing it blows because you upload like 500 videos right so you'll cringe for every video Because it's always new but you'll be in trance, but then the next time you watch you've already seen it So you don't cringe anymore now you're a fan, so you kind of just watch it Sends this to me. I don't know why but he's the same you guilty of that too. He's he's crudgy The white you feel towards Chris J's whatever else feels It's the same feeling that satisfaction you get Satisfaction you get from Chris J's what do people feel it stands further

 SPEAKER_03 [0:52:43.834 --> 0:52:48.390]: 
  Yeah, that makes me uncomfortable. Another thing is, I don't laugh at that stuff. I turn that off.

 SPEAKER_07 [0:52:51.867 --> 0:52:52.002]: 
  right

 SPEAKER_05 [0:52:59.494 --> 0:53:01.705]: 
  But you'll be in trance. But then the next time you watch it, you're gonna be in trance.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53 --> 0:53:00.490]: 
  in Trance.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:53 --> 0:53:05.957]: 
  So you kind of just watch it to watch it. I'm out of Christian.

 SPEAKER_05 [0:53:07.982 --> 0:53:08.370]: 
  Well, he's just...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:10.362 --> 0:53:12.505]: 
  I'm not a fan of this stuff, but Chris- The white you feel towards-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:11.999 --> 0:53:12.809]: 
  You're towards Christian.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:13.534 --> 0:53:14.884]: 
  Chris Chaney involved.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:15.559 --> 0:53:18.158]: 
  It's the same feeling that satisfaction gets...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:19.677 --> 0:53:25.954]: 
  Steads further. I think cringe is one of those definitions is so up in the air speaking of cringe Jesus Christ shit the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:23.524 --> 0:53:28.874]: 
  Speaking of cringe Jesus Christ, shut the fuck up, let's get to our next question

 SPEAKER_07 [0:53:26.832 --> 0:53:30.443]: 
  Next question. Let's get to our cringy answer. Yeah. Whatever.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:28.536 --> 0:53:31.945]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_06 [0:53:30.443 --> 0:53:31.354]: 
  We didn't even answer.

 SPEAKER_06 [0:53:31.945 --> 0:53:42.239]: 
  by saying I do think that some videos go super overboring. Yeah, totally. What's my drink? What are you doing? Yes. This is my drink. That's my drink. Wait, sorry. That was your last statement? No, no, no, no, sorry, sorry, sorry.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:34.949 --> 0:53:38.948]: 
  Yeah, totally drink. What are you doing? Yes, this is my drink like that wait?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:38.948 --> 0:53:39.505]: 
  Sorry, that was...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:39.505 --> 0:53:43.622]: 
  That was your last statement. Sorry, sorry, sorry. So, go and look up anyway. So, like...

 SPEAKER_06 [0:53:43.622 --> 0:54:10.116]: 
  Yeah Chris Chad, on one of you have Chris Chad, on the other end you have people who upload and kill yourself comics or some fat guy who's just doing movie reviews or something. There's a huge rainbow. Yeah, I don't mind seeing someone, okay here's another example, one last example, but I don't mind if somebody's clearly trying. If you see someone who's put their heart into everything and if it's a little cringy you can still have past it because at least in their eyes they're actually like... Like Chris Chad tries, he really means what he's doing. Another thing about Chris Chad is that it's such a...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:50.659 --> 0:53:50.693]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [0:53:50.693 --> 0:53:51.435]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:52.634 --> 0:53:53.444]: 
  Yeah, like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:53.444 --> 0:53:53.916]: 
  I don't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:06.083 --> 0:54:07.619]: 
  like kristia tries

 SPEAKER_07 [0:54:09.323 --> 0:54:19.026]: 
  That is such horseshit. You know you take that video link it to all your friends No, that's not true at all. Yes it is. No it isn't. Another thing. There's a great-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:12.495 --> 0:54:12.951]: 
  All your friends.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:12.951 --> 0:54:14.942]: 
  That's not true!

 SPEAKER_06 [0:54:14.588 --> 0:54:24.527]: 
  true at all yes it is another thing there's a gray area between somebody who is clearly out of their fucking mind and somebody who is actually

 SPEAKER_07 [0:54:24.527 --> 0:54:29.438]: 
  How do you even know who's out of their fucking minds? Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:54:27.919 --> 0:54:28.763]:

  I'm the concept of autism I've been lying for four fucking years You think I can't tell the difference between an autistic who's imploded on himself? He harbored me

 SPEAKER_02 [0:54:38.939 --> 0:54:41.942]:

So when you see something new, like a guy walking into McDonald's and puking all over himself and falling the puke and doing like a snow angel, that would make you laugh because it's new and you never see it before. It's interesting, it's captivating.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:46.716 --> 0:56:46.969]:

 SPEAKER_06 [1:12:16.883 --> 1:12:18.165]: 
  And it goes good on every one.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:17.035 --> 1:12:17.946]: 
  I sort of get this.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:23.717 --> 1:12:29.860]: 
  No, it's not that you're kidding, it's because you're from another country where your tastes are just sweet.

 SPEAKER_07 [1:12:28.341 --> 1:12:33.977]: 
  Yeah, the sweet palate is actually more like thing in Ireland. And you know what the weird thing is?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:32.729 --> 1:12:40.930]: 
  And you know what the weird thing is, is like, for example, today me and Mick went to the store and it was a grocery store that I've been to once, but he hasn't been to so I was like,

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:40.930 --> 1:12:46.937]: 
  Come check out this grocery store because they have a lot of good ingredients for cooking and shit and in the back They had bad

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:46.937 --> 1:12:51.004]: 
  bags of crickets and mealworms. I saw that on Twitter.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:51.004 --> 1:12:55.949]: 
  And then we picked them up and we ate them and it was great and they were like really nice. The crickets were...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:53.907 --> 1:12:54.734]:

Dude, what's really bizarre to me is like growing up, my dad told me like, he would basically ground me if I didn't eat vegetables. So, like, at a young age, I learned to like vegetables. And it was to a point where my dad would actually buy me like tomatoes and then I would like fruit roll-ups for me. I would go so far as to say, I would, I love tomatoes. I used to actually drink tomato juice. You would get...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:15:10.392 --> 1:15:11.944]: 
  Which is weak to me because...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:15:11.522 --> 1:15:12.180]:

Orban just is basically asking would you guys want to expand on the studio bringing on other artists? So yeah, I'm assuming like- Let's say maybe not yet. I'll tell you this, I think a lot of people have assumed a lot of people have asked if we were gonna have a similar to you know, new brands kind of thing was user submitted. I don't think we'll ever have that. But eventually- I don't think that's what it is. I think it's more like a collaborating- No, no, no, no, you should tell me.

  No!

 SPEAKER_01 [1:26:42.992 --> 1:26:49.320]: 
  Well, there's a difference between watching a game for five minutes versus watching something for four hours.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:44.494 --> 1:26:44.916]: 
  between one and two.

 SPEAKER_06 [1:26:49.320 --> 1:26:52.358]: 
  A four hour watch is a game walk.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:26:51.329 --> 1:27:01.707]: 
  It's like watching a chess match. All right, know where this is going. Okay, so Zach, so what? I know it sounds hypocritical, but seriously, Street Fighter matches are over within a minute.

 SPEAKER_07 [1:26:54.923 --> 1:26:56.999]:

  I never said I watched my crept I would watch blood born or dark souls

 SPEAKER_06 [1:27:09.368 --> 1:27:32.318]: 
  Alright, Zach would watch Bloodborne for six hours. Because I want to see the strategy level for level moment to moment. Because it's not just a two-three-minute match, it is a whole fucking game. I just skip ahead and you cut off over. Yeah, there are parts where I'm like, oh, I know what happened to you. I would watch a six-hour Let's Play if someone playing Minecraft if it was like an interesting concept. Zach, watch your game, it's gonna be pleasure.

 SPEAKER_07 [1:27:09.705 --> 1:27:13.013]:

It's like not a big deal. What I

 SPEAKER_01 [1:49:04.437 --> 1:49:07.440]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_06 [1:49:40.836 --> 1:50:36.743]: 
  If you want to crack on a wee because he's not a weeb, you're fucking really nerd. If you want to be like, you're not a nerd because I know the fucking square root of 400, it's like, who cares faggot? I know like more game knowledge than you could ever know. It's like, whatever you call a weeb is a weeb. But in my opinion, like the whole culture of like, weebology? We-bo-log-y. We-ab-ology. We-ab-ology. We-ab-ology. The coin. This guy knows. The basics like, oh my god. Basically, I always found the closet. It's happening. I found the fascinating that like, they still watch- they still read mangas. Mangas. I don't want to get crucified. Thank you. And they still like, do arcades and shit. Like it's still really popular there. And that concept that they still like, do that kind of stuff and that- the different- I've always been fascinated in the different like, just that culture in general. Like I love the Japanese like, fashion and style. They have a really cool fashion in Japan. Like Tokyo has an amazing fashion sense. I love like the styles and shit. And beyond like-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:49:42.945 --> 1:49:43.992]: 
  That's like every year.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:49:43.992 --> 1:49:46.135]: 
  You're not really a nerd.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:49:44.481 --> 1:49:44.498]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:50:35.629 --> 1:50:40.084]: 
  And beyond like- No, it ends up being like what we end up emulating- Yeah, beyond the fact-

 SPEAKER_06 [1:50:38.785 --> 1:51:03.945]: 
  Yeah, beyond the fashion, beyond the games, and beyond the arcades and stuff, I've always been really fascinated with Japanese culture. Over...because American culture, I like Americans, I'm not gonna say I'm not an American, I love American culture. Well, American culture is such a hodgepodge of cultures. When you think about Japanese culture, it's very homogenous. It's a very isolated, very specific, laser- Maybe my-...crystallized, like, endpoint.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:50:51.036 --> 1:50:51.846]: 
  culture.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:51:01.482 --> 1:51:11.100]: 
  My crystallized like American culture is summed up like you buy a crockpot Hope that it works out

 SPEAKER_02 [1:51:03.945 --> 1:51:03.962]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:51:06.949 --> 1:51:08.839]: 
  Yeah, exactly. Shit it.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:51:10.425 --> 1:51:10.493]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_06 [1:51:10.493 --> 1:51:31.620]: 
  Yeah, and Japan has been very faithful to making sure that what they present to the world has been very much like Representative of their school that you like on a train to Japan and you'll pass under a statue of a giant robot It's like that happens there. That idea is awesome to me because in America. We're too busy. We're worried about like the stuff They're like gunman statues again

 SPEAKER_03 [1:51:18.897 --> 1:51:19.943]: 
  Yeah. It's just crazy.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:51:19.943 --> 1:51:20.854]:

 SPEAKER_04 [1:51:30.186 --> 1:51:33.629]: 
  I got like gunman statues and Godzilla statues Yeah the gun you

 SPEAKER_06 [1:51:32.717 --> 1:53:45.945]: 
  Yeah, the gun you wouldn't you wouldn't go through fucking New York and see a giant Gundam statue in her My my favorite story one of my favorite stories as far as like geek culture is concerned is I went to one of the second One of the Sega arcades and there was house of the dead Oh, that's a cool dude. There was this one guy. Sorry specifically one guy long hair And he was playing house of the dead and he did it with like it looked like he wasn't even looking at his name Long hair. Yeah, long hair. No, that would be a Chinese name But he was like he was at the the Sega arcade and he played house of the dead And he looked like he wasn't even looking at the screen But he was playing two players with both guns And he did this thing where he was just like almost like doing a dance while he was playing and you know what? He was like No, it looked like a gun caught a thing and he was doing headshot headshot headshot headshot head that now just be fair I didn't even know in house of the dead that you could do like a straight-up headshot kill I knew that that helped but I didn't know that like if you only did headshots in house of the dead That would actually like you know what that absolutely fascinates me. Yeah concept of that No, I never think around and watched it It was very normal People who get together and do DDR sessions and like these fucking Japanese like arcades there It's like an evil tournament. Everyone's lined up and fuck sharing these that's exactly what I mean back then watching somebody in Like a crowd playing a video game felt a little awkward Yeah, but now that we have like twi- I mean this isn't you know before the 2000s So now watching people play video games in a fucking huge room is normal and celebrated But when I was doing it it felt a little awkward so it is kind of interesting how things have fucking changed Yeah, so next question we've got and we're getting close fellers This is from Super slums if you could run your own convention What would be the first thing you do?

  Not only your fucking ear-sorting or just- Let's paint the L's purple too. You know what I would do if I ran a convention? I would create a map where if there was a thing you needed to see or wanted to see you'd actually be able to find it. Wow, that's a good idea. Because I know, right? Because I feel like we've gone to some conventions where people like almost hide the rooms that people are supposed to go to in these very like fucking Sisyphean mazes. Do they have these fucking like Metroidvania bullshit? No, I know. It's like six fucking rooms about what you're supposed to go on. And then it's a big surprise that people don't fucking figure it out. Yeah, it's like, oh I didn't know this is that room 42. So anyways, yeah, if I ran a convention, number one, make a fucking map that people can actually follow. They don't have to download the app and fucking have a degree in fucking physics.

  He's just it!

 SPEAKER_06 [1:59:09.490 --> 1:59:20.999]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:59:15.092 --> 1:59:15.278]:

 SPEAKER_04 [1:59:15.278 --> 1:59:16.797]:

  People are weird if you understand human nature as dad's not that fucking strange.

 SPEAKER_06 [1:59:25.335 --> 1:59:56.065]: 
  Really what it comes down to is my dad was just sort of a child. If you want to know the honest truth, my dad's father died when he was 13. So he didn't really know how to be a father when he was 13. And not to mention his mom. He had you with her. Yeah, no. His mom gave him everything he ever wanted. If his room was dirty, she would clean it up. He had no idea of the constant. What did he do when he had you, Corey? The constant of responsibility. He was like, I don't know, like he was 40 something. Oh. Maybe 30. Oh, so he grew up.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:59:39.325 --> 1:59:42.075]: 
  His mom. Yeah, no.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:59:48.842 --> 1:59:51.441]: 
  What age is he when he had you, Corey?

 SPEAKER_07 [1:59:48.876 --> 1:59:48.960]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:59:51.492 --> 1:59:51.745]: 
  Like.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:59:53.888 --> 1:59:59.828]: 
  Oh, maybe 30. Oh, so he grew up like a coddled faggot, and like everything was kind of handed down.

 SPEAKER_06 [1:59:57.769 --> 2:00:26.946]: 
  Like everything was kind of handed to him. Exactly, everything was handed to him. He became very narcissistic. So the concept of a kid was just like he would keep him around and love him, but he would also fuck with him. And his idea of fucking with him was just like, you know, as if it was like a college kid who was fucking with him when he was like, hey. Cory, do you want kids? No, well, maybe when I'm older. You don't want to repeat the same process? I don't. I don't want to teach my kids to be like, hey. What would you teach your kids? Cory, what would you teach your kids?

 SPEAKER_02 [2:00:23.639 --> 2:00:28.127]: 
  What would you teach your kids? I'd go stick your hand with a stormy motion. Corey, what would you teach your kids? I might teach you something. What is the top three?

  What's a better name? What's a better name? What would you have named it? Yellow alien? Yellow alien? Yeah, yellow alien dude. I would have called it... It's still a shitty name, but it's a damn sight better. What the hell is a hominid? I thought it was...

 SPEAKER_04 [2:06:44.997 --> 2:06:47.022]: 
  What's a better name?

 SPEAKER_01 [2:06:46.937 --> 2:06:48.945]: 
  You named it. Yellow alien.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:06:47.984 --> 2:06:48.473]: 
  K wea

 SPEAKER_06 [2:06:48.945 --> 2:06:51.713]: 
  No, you didn't. No way, we do.

 SPEAKER_07 [2:06:56.438 --> 2:06:58.446]: 
  Someone was flipping through this like comments

 SPEAKER_06 [2:06:56.505 --> 2:07:09.668]: 
  Someone was flipping through this. Like, homicide, hominide, homicide. I think it's like a bi-bendle humanoid creature. Yeah, I think Jeff's got it. Look, this is what it is. It's the alien. The alien heard the word humanoid. He went, I'm a hominid. And that's all it is.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:06:58.446 --> 2:07:01.500]: 
  I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Harba-sai. Harba-sai.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:07:01.500 --> 2:07:03.863]: 
  That's all humanoid creatures. Yeah, thanks, Jessica.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:07:03.863 --> 2:07:05.669]: 
  Look, this is what it is. Is it A-Tembe?

 SPEAKER_03 [2:07:03.998 --> 2:07:04.437]: 
  This is one.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:07:04.504 --> 2:07:04.943]: 
  What is this?

 SPEAKER_05 [2:07:11.676 --> 2:07:27.437]: 
  Where did the name come from, Tom? There is a story. Dan woke up one morning with a really bad headache and he told his then-girlfriend, I feel like an alien hominid bit my head off. Who knows, sir? I thought you were going to say something pretty dark, like you had a...

 SPEAKER_04 [2:07:11.811 --> 2:07:14.882]: 
  What is the name of the alien from Tom?

 SPEAKER_06 [2:07:24.585 --> 2:07:27.960]: 
  I thought you're gonna say something pretty dark like you woke up

 SPEAKER_04 [2:07:27.437 --> 2:07:31.116]: 
  Woke up and called his girlfriend. I want to break up with you. No, no.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:07:30.019 --> 2:07:41.865]: 
  No, no, and she said what does an alien hominid look like? And he, that's, then he drew it. So he made up the word? No, hominid's a word. The word exists. He combined it, I guess, with alien.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:07:35.183 --> 2:07:36.381]: 
  So he made up the word.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:07:37.343 --> 2:07:37.950]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:07:37.950 --> 2:07:39.452]: 
  They, the word exists.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:07:39.452 --> 2:07:39.959]: 
  Oh.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:07:43.182 --> 2:08:02.706]: 
  Would you like to cover any other game development stories? Yeah, I'm curious because you have all the spicy deeds, my friend. Yeah, you know what, Tom? All we see is the results of all your guys' hard work here. We see the success of the games you guys have made. What are the horror stories? What's the shit that almost killed you all while you were making these games? I'm out.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:07:47.333 --> 2:07:48.345]: 
  Yo, kill this because you're...

 SPEAKER_02 [2:07:50.252 --> 2:07:50.337]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:08:01.997 --> 2:08:05.862]: 
  I remember watching him program at the very end of Castle Crashers.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:08:05.862 --> 2:08:09.794]: 
  I think Tom, I think Tom's gratefully didn't have a gun on his death.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:08:11.954 --> 2:08:14.164]: 
  No. Well, yeah, that is like a... He was very...

 SPEAKER_06 [2:08:13.354 --> 2:08:18.619]: 
  He was very upset, he looked very tired. Cause he was running like two full-time jobs basically.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:08:18.619 --> 2:08:38.987]: 
  The final year of Castle Crashers was a year of non-stop work around the clock. Jesus. I like... And it's interesting because it's like, you kind of feel like, uh, as you're getting older, it's like, can I still do that? And then every once in a while you have like a period where you remind yourself that you can. Were you married? Married during that time? I got married towards the end.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:08:33.874 --> 2:08:35.359]: 
  Were you married during that time?

 SPEAKER_05 [2:08:39.612 --> 2:08:41.856]: 
  Or, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:08:41.265 --> 2:08:44.708]: 
  Yeah. There's pretty shitty planning on your... Yeah, that's the gun.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:08:43.341 --> 2:09:07.050]: 
  Yeah, that's it. But then didn't have kids until afterwards, so that worked out. That was well planned. But was this Alien Hominet or Castle Crashers? Castle Crashers. Oh, okay. Yeah, Alien Hominet was like a cake wall compared to Castle Crashers, because Alien Hominet seemed stressful at the time, because like at that time I was also like always canceling plans with anyone that wanted to do stuff and whatever, but I still, you know, it wasn't as all-encompassing and it took 15 months. Sorry.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:08:48.842 --> 2:08:49.349]: 
 拜拜

 SPEAKER_06 [2:08:50.699 --> 2:08:51.458]: 
  Castle Crashers.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:09:06.527 --> 2:09:13.041]: 
  You also have to juggle QC and handle all the other shit at the end that you didn't even first see.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:09:08.991 --> 2:09:09.447]: 
  What's-

 SPEAKER_06 [2:09:09.008 --> 2:09:15.319]: 
  What's QC? Handle all the other shit at the end that you didn't even first see. I always saw an alien...

 SPEAKER_01 [2:09:15.319 --> 2:09:16.855]: 
  dealing with publishers

 SPEAKER_06 [2:09:16.230 --> 2:09:26.254]: 
  I'm afraid to say the name now alien hour Alien hour Hominid, Hominid, Alien Hominid Alien Hominilod How do I ask you? I always thought alien hominid um You fucked it up you said it Did I? Did I fuck it up?

 SPEAKER_01 [2:09:17.766 --> 2:09:18.509]: 
  Alien hours.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:09:19.875 --> 2:09:21.749]: 
  Alien home in a lot.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:09:27.216 --> 2:09:54.368]: 
  I always thought it was kind of a game like when I first played it It was kind of a game that was kind of made as you went like because you start like seeing like the first level How it's coated then you start like seeing because it gets fucking crazy with bosses and like levels and shit You're just like Because you don't really know what's going on like because you're an alien that's attacking but like there was so many different Bosses and stuff is that what happened was that the kind of process like yeah, that's when you learn newer things and implemented that's been the way All right

 SPEAKER_02 [2:09:27.570 --> 2:09:28.499]: 
  I always thought it.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:09:28.499 --> 2:09:29.174]: 
 所以說

 SPEAKER_05 [2:09:53.609 --> 2:09:57.287]: 
  That's been the way all of them have been basically, is just build as you go.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:09:56.933 --> 2:10:00.224]: 
  I mean that's good because you learn new things and then you can go back and change it.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:09:59.987 --> 2:10:18.044]: 
  Yeah, like there's always that there you will actually there used to be that guilt of not having like a design doc Everyone says you're supposed to have a design doc we plan all out ahead of time Well, even sure games have a design. Yeah, so much changes as you go though And you serve you realize that you're gonna keep having ideas and keep wanting to change things so Do you think it's working?

 SPEAKER_04 [2:10:07.328 --> 2:10:09.319]: 
  Well, even shitty games have a design.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:10:17.183 --> 2:10:25.215]: 
  It seems like it's working. Do you think in hindsight you'd make alien helmet easier? Yes. Because the sound is a very hard game. Yeah. Yeah. The biggest frustrating.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:10:21.115 --> 2:10:45.938]: 
  Yes. Cause it's known as a very hard game. Yeah. I can't even remember frustrating. The biggest regret besides it being hard in general, the biggest regret is that the second level is so hard. Like the freeway level. Compared to the other ones. And it's funny because there's some levels that have really cheap deaths, but the freeway level I can play without dying. So it actually isn't like a cheap death level compared to some of the others, but most people use up all their lives on the freeway level. You just have to get good at it.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:10:32.084 --> 2:10:33.214]: 
  Compared to the other ones.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:10:44.740 --> 2:10:45.246]: 
  You just have to

 SPEAKER_01 [2:10:45.246 --> 2:10:46.495]: 
  like a good at it like.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:10:46.495 --> 2:10:48.267]: 
  of that battle toads thing.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:10:47.946 --> 2:10]: 
  Okay, you know what I don't know fuck that load you talking about the speed ratio

 SPEAKER_04 [2:10:48.267 --> 2:10:48.452]: 
  You know what?

 SPEAKER_06 [2:10 --> 2:11:36.225]: 
  with the fuck no dude that those things came so quick trying to time that at times was virtually fucking impossible I mean in theory like this is that randomized that I don't think it was randomized I don't think it was I think it just didn't matter because of the the spacing of them it wasn't like you could just like oh I know this it's like well they still a ninja Sam they threw curveballs because at that part you're going like back and forth back and then it's kind of like a rhythm but then like suddenly there's two there to there and then like does it again there's two there you can kind of try to fuck and then there was some right I think I don't remember a hundred percent but I'm pretty sure there was somewhere like you had to jump over a pit but you had to time the jump right because right when you got to the other side there would have been like another thing waiting for you or something another ramp to jump yeah I just remember that was it fucking tough that was a third level battle told anyone

 SPEAKER_04 [2:10:57.109 --> 2:10:58.965]: 
  Well, I mean in theory like this is it right?

 SPEAKER_00 [2:11:00.164 --> 2:11:01.952]: 
  I don't think it was randomized.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:11:09.276 --> 2:11:11.301]: 
  Well they still a ninja samurai

 SPEAKER_03 [2:11:11.301 --> 2:11:11.622]: 
  through

 SPEAKER_04 [2:11:15.385 --> 2:11:15.959]: 
  and it's kind of like...

 SPEAKER_02 [2:11:20.700 --> 2:11:22.236]: 
  And then there were some where I think

 SPEAKER_01 [2:11:31.568 --> 2:11:32.496]: 
  another ramp to

 SPEAKER_02 [2:11:32.496 --> 2:11:34.994]: 
  Yeah, I just remember that was it fucking tough. That was a third

 SPEAKER_00 [2:11:34.994 --> 2:11:37.457]: 
  That battle told us anyways moving on

 SPEAKER_01 [2:11:35.618 --> 2:11:35.753]: 
  I'll tell you what.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:11:36.006 --> 2:11:38.774]: 
  Anyways, moving on. Here's a question. Tom.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:11:38.774 --> 2:11:47.599]: 
  What are your inspirations growing up to influence your game development career?

 SPEAKER_05 [2:11:47.667 --> 2:12:26.867]: 
  The biggest ongoing influences is Treasure. So they made Gunstar Heroes, Guardian Heroes, Radiant Silver Gun. Where like the big ones that really inspire like game feel for me and... They had good music and good show. Yeah, everything was cool in those games. Gunstar was like... And I was able to beat them all too. Like I... It's funny like considering Alien Hominids so hard because I hated hard games growing up. So I liked that I could beat all of the games. Is that your vengeance? Was that like your... No, I think it just... It didn't know any better. Like I thought it had to be... I thought it was supposed to be hard. Like it's... Hadn't stepped out of that......line set. The Treasure doesn't exist anymore, right? No, they're still around. You trying to draw a parallel there?

 SPEAKER_07 [2:11:58.534 --> 2:11:58.939]: 
  really is.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:11:58.939 --> 2:11:59.783]: 
  Spirely.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:12:02.702 --> 2:12:03.310]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:12:03.175 --> 2:12:04.002]: 
  Everything was cool.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:12:14.920 --> 2:12:16.540]: 
  No, I think it just, it's didn't know any better.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:12:29.348 --> 2:12:29.972]: 
  They're

 SPEAKER_06 [2:12:29.399 --> 2:12:39.439]: 
  What's what's what's a good game to you? What makes a good game? What do you seek out to do besides besides like fun obviously what create fun? But what do you what do you think a good game needs to have? All right

 SPEAKER_01 [2:12:29.972 --> 2:12:30.360]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:12:39.439 --> 2:13:39.143]: 
  Well, that's a Well, okay, I'll just look at what I enjoyed like recently like Super Mario 3d world on The Wii U there's a there's a video on YouTube that kind of gets into how they do it where pretty much every level has a unique toy or theme and At the start of the level you get introduced to the theme in a safe way where you can't get hurt while you learn it and Then next they have you do the theme with a challenge involved Yeah, and then for the third phase they put a twist on it Yeah, and change it up and the whole games like that Interesting and it feels it's so well polished where like sometimes I think of it more like a physical toy than a game because it never reminds me that it's a game because it's so perfectly done Yeah video is mathematosis Hmm. He made that video. Yeah, I saw that one as well He's good and then that Captain Toad treasure tracker was the same way where like each level is just this fun little puzzle box We almost feel like you're playing with the like a toy in your hands for some reason

 SPEAKER_03 [2:13:01.005 --> 2:13:01.124]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:13:11.282 --> 2:13:11.451]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:13:26.352 --> 2:13:26.993]: 
  video.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:13:39.210 --> 2:13:45.977]: 
  Yeah, the view thing in that though is obnoxious. It can be a little weird. It can obscure the view, the gyro controls. What's a game you hated, Tom?

 SPEAKER_05 [2:13:41.472 --> 2:13:42.366]: 
  It could be a little weird.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:13:43.075 --> 2:13:43.463]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:13:46.416 --> 2:13:47.952]: 
  What's a game everyone liked and you

 SPEAKER_02 [2:13:47.952 --> 2:13:48.475]: 
  You hated it.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:13:48.475 --> 2:13:56.339]: 
  Well, the original Mario, but more and more people do come out of the woodwork admitting they hated the original Mario, but I didn't like the original Mario.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:13:54.060 --> 2:14:00.456]: 
  I've you know what I'm playing that fucking game again. I'm like the Mario re meet like the Nintendo really

 SPEAKER_00 [2:13:59.815 --> 2:14:04.439]: 
  Are we really gonna shit on Mary brothers? Hold on, hold on, hold on!

 SPEAKER_06 [2:14:03.004 --> 2:14:28.604]: 
  I'm gonna stay and say I like it. I'm not shitting. This is why we like this game. Hold on, hold on, hold on. I'm not shitting on Mario Brothers. It fucking came and it landed. It fucking revolutionized video games all over again after the crash of the video game market or whatever the fuck. But in our day and age, that game is a clunky mess. Like playing the mess, like remixes and stuff, you realize how fucking floaty your jumps are. Like when you jump, your fucking momentum is still going.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:14:04.439 --> 2:14:05.940]: 
  I like your fails!

 SPEAKER_03 [2:14:05.940 --> 2:14:08.050]: 
  This is the way we like this game.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:14:16.994 --> 2:14:17.449]: 
  Fuck

 SPEAKER_05 [2:14:27.962 --> 2:14:29.785]: 
  So what's the next remix? Haven't heard of this.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:14:29.785 --> 2:14:43.825]: 
  It's a it's actually a really cool concept where it lets you play old NES games and they kind of put a challenge on it It's very artistic way. It's really fucking difficult like sometimes it's really easy like oh collect three coins and then it's like oh

 SPEAKER_04 [2:14:36.265 --> 2:14:37.733]: 
  in a very artistic way.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:14:44.517 --> 2:14:59.940]: 
  Fucking what do you call it? Where you like? Basically, it's like if you were eating cereal like with marshmallows and like all of a sudden one of the games was only eat blue Marshmallows, and you sat there like an idiot staring into your bowl cereal looking for blue

 SPEAKER_03 [2:14:48.702 --> 2:14:51.452]: 
  Basically it's like a cheat that we did.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:14:59.940 --> 2:15:01.814]: 
  marshmallows. Congratulations you won.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:15:01.814 --> 2:15:23.447]: 
  Yeah, and if you get it you have a time thing and the stars so you want to get the best stars to get the best time But sometimes they're like hey exploited glitch in our game We didn't fucking fix because we didn't know about it at the time But everyone else knows about it now we know about it because of the internet and you're like excuse me I don't know how to do this and then it's like oh too bad you don't get any stars

 SPEAKER_07 [2:15:20.612 --> 2:15:21.996]: 
  Why did he hit Mario Bros?

 SPEAKER_02 [2:15:21.996 --> 2:15:29.944]: 
  I would have known what are the reasons you would hate Mario. They said the original like three still holds them. It was hard and yeah like three still holds them.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:15:23.447 --> 2:15:24.747]: 
  you would hate me

 SPEAKER_05 [2:15:27.109 --> 2:15:31.885]: 
  It was hard and yeah, like no three two a lot I like to a lot and I like to

 SPEAKER_06 [2:15:29.522 --> 2:15:43.309]: 
  I like two a lot and I like three. Two in world are the best in my opinion. I think two is garbage. Two is good. It was an original Mario game. I just think good one. It's still way better than the first one.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:15:33.809 --> 2:15:39.951]: 
  I think it was something about the first one just never it wasn't originally a Mario game

 SPEAKER_07 [2:15:39.445 --> 2:15:41.436]: 
  I just think good one, it's not a horrible game.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:15:43.292 --> 2:16:41.815]: 
  Did you guys ever play Bayou Billy? Oh yeah. So Bayou Billy was like, the first level was a brawler, but it also had like driving levels and stuff and the graphics were pretty good and I was really excited about it. But the first level was like this really long slow level where the enemies like there's this like I think it was like a guy in like a wetsuit that came out of the water that took forever to kill and the whole level just was just like this slow slog and most of the time you never beat the first level. I remember this one afternoon Wade beat the first level and then played through like all these there's like this whole game after the first level that he was able to play through after that. But there was like I think it was just like that one afternoon and I've never seen anything but the first level. Was that one of the accomplishments that he holds dear to his heart? Wade always was better. He was more he persevered with the games more. I liked seeing the details of the game and everything. So you still haven't explained why you didn't like Mario? Yeah, I just don't. I think in general like I don't like when you die and have to repeat a bunch of crap. That's like the best part of a game.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:15:45.807 --> 2:15:45.942]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_07 [2:15:46.988 --> 2:15:47.933]: 
  the En初s...

 SPEAKER_02 [2:16:31.842 --> 2:16:32.939]: 
  See, he still haven't explained why.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:16:32.939 --> 2:16:33.781]: 
  why you didn't like my video.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:16:40.818 --> 2:16:51.450]: 
  Also, you can just hold select and then start again or was it select an a or just whatever it was and you could literally Restart at the world. Do you mean like start from the beginning from the whole game or?

 SPEAKER_05 [2:16:51.450 --> 2:17:03.449]: 
  you still like dying and run out of lives and snap this Podcast talked about Mario though. I don't know

 SPEAKER_03 [2:16:54.100 --> 2:16:54.285]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_07 [2:16:54.504 --> 2:16:58.014]: 
  I was looking for

 SPEAKER_03 [2:16:58.014 --> 2:16:58.031]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_06 [2:17:00.326 --> 2:17:01.996]: 
  Yeah, it's all right. We're talking about game this

 SPEAKER_02 [2:17:01.996 --> 2:17:06.941]: 
  I'll say I saw I like Mario. I wouldn't say that I love it. I mean I got good memories

 SPEAKER_06 [2:17:06.098 --> 2:17:21.977]: 
  I mean, I got good memories. I love part three. I want to know, I want to know, as a game developer and owner of Newgrounds, what's the most rock star moment you've had? I mean, I'm talking like you dropped off in LA, you were at a club doing a blow off of Strippers' Tits.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:17:07.818 --> 2:17:08.984]: 
  I want to know

 SPEAKER_01 [2:17:20.492 --> 2:17:25.621]: 
  I see the videos of this guy, I see the videos of this guy doing coke up those hookers. Yeah, I wanna know what's the most

 SPEAKER_06 [2:17:24.002 --> 2:17:29.993]: 
  Yeah, I want to know what's the most rock star moment that you're gonna do? Yeah, and if it's too intense, we'll break it down.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:17:39.966 --> 2:17:46.058]: 
  Oh, yeah, I don't know if I've really had a serious rock star moment. He was in the middle of the dance floor with a dick.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:17:41.602 --> 2:17:46.699]: 
  That's serious rock star moment. He's in the middle of the dance floor. He hiked, baged, the dressing alien hub.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:17:46.699 --> 2:18:03.152]:

  But yeah, no, I, yeah, I don't know. Just the few times that I've been recognized by people, like, if I'm with someone who doesn't, like, let's say I'm with one of April's friends, husbands or boyfriends somewhere, and someone recognizes me, that it's like really surreal, because I'm not like, no, I don't know, no one knows that I do anything that anyone cares about. I've been there, I've seen it.

 SPEAKER_07 [2:18:28.666 --> 2:18:33.240]: 
  I've been there. I've seen kids recognize Tom. I know.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:18:32.549 --> 2:18:34.439]: 
  It really doesn't happen much.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:18:34.236 --> 2:18:48.005]: 
  Like that one kid who recognized you from across the street and he ran over you to get your autographing hit by a car. We were just eating a tea. Oh yeah, that's the best. Can I build up a question, can I ask you who's the most famous person you've met because of Newgrounds? Like what's the furthest you've gotten?

 SPEAKER_04 [2:18:38.320 --> 2:18:40.496]:

 SPEAKER_00 [2:19:36.014 --> 2:19:36.454]: 
  Greg.

 SPEAKER_07 [2:19:44.993 --> 2:19:52.249]: 
  ever since Mark played the, sorry, Greg, Greg Mark, ever since, Tommy and I made the room game and ever since he played the room game, he's been playing the room game for a long

 SPEAKER_05 [2:19:52.249 --> 2:19:57.936]: 
  played the game because he's been like a super fan of Tom's and you know they've got chat and he's like hey Tom wait he made the end you were

 SPEAKER_06 [2:19:57.936 --> 2:20:01.446]:

 SPEAKER_05 [2:19:59.252 --> 2:20:01.007]: 
  You made Christian, Chris made me.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:20:01.007 --> 2:20:07.335]: 
  Yeah, cause when you did everything that you see, you did the visuals. I did the art. Tom transcribed the entire fucking movie.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:20:01.446 --> 2:20:02.070]: 
  You did it.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:20:08.449 --> 2:20:10.845]: 
  and then filled in all the plattles.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:20:12.651 --> 2:20:17.140]: 
  Well, himself. I'm just taking a five-sets of filling all the plot holes. What do you mean, what?

 SPEAKER_06 [2:20:15.942 --> 2:20:25.054]: 
  What do you mean when you walk in and like Denny jerking off? Yeah, like there's the part where the character disappears in mid-movie, Tom. And then you just go find them like...

 SPEAKER_05 [2:20:23.350 --> 2:20:43.448]: 
  There's a lot of stuff in the movie that doesn't really follow a proper order so you have to tie it all together And also you have to... It's like a jumble of things Like if you're seeing everything through Johnny's perspective then you have to fill in the parts where other... Yeah That Johnny wasn't part of and tell the story where Johnny wasn't in the scene You need to find the way to have that story come into Johnny's life Yeah, OCDs You put it on!

 SPEAKER_07 [2:20:29.492 --> 2:20:31.652]: 
  Also you have to like if you're

 SPEAKER_06 [2:20:41.355 --> 2:21:15.004]: 
  Yeah, OCDs. You put your fucking effort into Tommy Wiseau to- Did you figure out how many days they were in the movie? How many days passed? Cause like when they play the game and like he sleeps every night, Tom actually figured that out. Like every- every technical day in the movie that passes. Did you end the story arc for Clodette's breast cancer or no? Oh, no, yeah, that's probably the one thing we didn't touch on. She did DLC. Clodette's breast cancer. So what happened? So what happened, Joe? Well, yeah, Greg invited Tom down to Philly. He's like, I'm doing a reading- a script reading and I'm doing a book signing and you know, I'm gonna- it's a whole thing.

 SPEAKER_07 [2:21:01.690 --> 2:21:04.440]: 
  She did DLC. Well that's breast cancer.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:21:06.010 --> 2:21:06.094]:

  the so I'm like hey you just want to go along and I'm like yeah sure so

 SPEAKER_06 [2:21:20.505 --> 2:21:35.744]: 
  We went down to this event with Greg and he's on stage and you know it was pretty cool It was like he was showed a bunch of behind the scenes video interviews. He showed Tommy Wazow Doing these weird commercials from back before he did the room. No, it's just like banquet hall

 SPEAKER_02 [2:21:34.444 --> 2:21:36.503]: 
  I was just like, bank with Hall event or...

 SPEAKER_06 [2:21:36.503 --> 2:21:37.431]: 
  Where is this like back at the corner?

 SPEAKER_02 [2:21:37.431 --> 2:21:39.439]: 
  the bar, they cleared out some tables.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:21:38.798 --> 2:21:44.890]: 
  I don't know what you'd call it was actually a morgue that had been converted into like a vent space and had a balcony

 SPEAKER_06 [2:21:39.439 --> 2:21:40.165]: 
  what you'd call it.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:21:42.780 --> 2:21:52.855]: 
  It had a balcony and a shadow. It was a cool space. Was it quaint? Not too quaint. It was packed though. It was packed with people. Packed with super room fans. Was the old.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:21:44.890 --> 2:21:46.915]: 
  It was a cool speech.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:21:52.855 --> 2:21:54.036]: 
  dressed as the characters.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:21:54.036 --> 2:21:57.445]: 
  Do they all have their fucking plastics? They invited people up on sale.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:21:56.061 --> 2:21:59.942]: 
  They invited people up on stage to do readings and a lot of them...

 SPEAKER_07 [2:21:59.942 --> 2:22:02.879]: 
  nailed it really honestly they all just they did the voice

 SPEAKER_04 [2:22:02.541 --> 2:22:03.165]: 
  the voices.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:22:03.165 --> 2:22:20.108]: 
  They, everybody was like flamboyant, enthusiastic about it. Everybody was having a fucking ball. In other words, it was hell for you. No, no, I liked it because, you know, I like the, I got obsessed with the movie after Happy Harry showed it to us and that's why we made the fucking game. Right.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:22:20.901 --> 2:22:29.440]: 
  So the whole event went pretty swimmingly and uh, you know at the end you know when Greg's like, alright I'm gonna do my, I'm gonna

 SPEAKER_06 [2:22:29.440 --> 2:22:42.197]: 
  I'm gonna do my book signing and Tom and I get in line and keep in mind this is like the first this is the first time in my life I've ever asked for an autograph from fucking anybody. Did you really want it or were you just being polite?

 SPEAKER_01 [2:22:40.088 --> 2:22:40.847]: 
  Did you really want to?

 SPEAKER_06 [2:22:43.058 --> 2:23:02.582]: 
  I was like, I wanted the book, I wanted to read the book, so I'm like... You read as well, just sorry. I felt awkward about it. I felt awkward. I'm like, I hope this is... You can't tell that to somebody. I'm like, I don't know how I'm gonna handle this, because I've never asked anybody for an autograph before. And you know, Tom, I guess Tom goes first, I think, because you know, those two are chatting it up about like, but instant best friends are taking pictures together.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:22:46.500 --> 2:22:48.340]: 
  He built his world just so he could feel awkward about it.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:22:49.470 --> 2:22:50.719]: 
  I hope this is- You can't tell that to somebody.

 SPEAKER_07 [2:22:50.449 --> 2:22:50.804]: 
  I'm right.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:23:04.540 --> 2:23:07.442]: 
  I mean I have to say I was like hey man I wish everybody could

 SPEAKER_01 [2:23:07.442 --> 2:23:08.995]: 
  We have a friendship like this. We didn't talk about it.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:23:08.995 --> 2:23:15.542]: 
  Greg and he's like, hey man, he's like, you know, he's like asking, he's like, come on, come to Hollywood when we make the movie.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:23:15.542 --> 2:23:20.706]: 
  This is before this was even public knowledge. She's like, hey man, we're making a movie and you're invited

 SPEAKER_05 [2:23:21.465 --> 2:23:33.599]: 
  I didn't get invited to the movie. Well, they did the premiere. I was hoping. No, I didn't get invited to the pier. I'm hoping. Right. It's still happening. If the movie even gets made. My dream is getting invited to the premiere. So the whole thing.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:23:27.017 --> 2:23:27.996]: 
  Great.

 SPEAKER_07 [2:23:27.996 --> 2:23:29.009]: 
  The movie gets me.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:23:31.725 --> 2:23:38.948]: 
  So the whole time I felt like this weird dickhead like on the sidelines or you guys are fucking nerds

 SPEAKER_00 [2:23:38.256 --> 2:23:40.500]: 
  Means

 SPEAKER_01 [2:23:40.500 --> 2:23:45.006]: 
  So I grabbed a book, they gave me a book, and I'm like, oh boy, here we go.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:23:45.006 --> 2:23:49.444]: 
  And I go up and I'm like, hey, Greg, guys, go. And I shake his hand. And I'm like, hey, man.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:23:49.444 --> 2:23:54.945]: 
  fan you know I don't know what to say and then he opens the book and the book was art

 SPEAKER_06 [2:23:54.945 --> 2:24:01.712]: 
  already pre-signed. It was pre-signed. So I'm like, he's like, I guess I'll just sign it again.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:24:03.923 --> 2:24:07.450]: 
  It's like it's like wait, where did you get the book to begin with they?

 SPEAKER_06 [2:24:07.230 --> 2:24:13.947]: 
  They had a pile there that they were just giving everybody in line to like go up get signed by Greg, but I guess there was a pile

 SPEAKER_00 [2:24:13.947 --> 2:24:15.938]: 
  that was pre-signed. I don't know what they were doing.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:24:15.938 --> 2:24:16.731]: 
  doing with those.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:24:16.579 --> 2:24:28.510]: 
  Yeah, one time I was flying sure I was going through the airport of Philly and I bought that book and it was presigned. Yeah, it's weird I don't know. Do you think it was really signed? Yeah, no, it's signed. Did you read it? That's a really good book. I love that book. Yeah, I still gotta read it actually

  Oh yeah, no no no, I think I saw it. I think I heard about that. Really? I have no idea. He really looks like Tommy's old. I had no idea fucking he was another James Franco project. I thought it was just like some other people who just took the reins. He did mention the game in the book, right? Yeah, he just mentions it.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:24:46.448 --> 2:24:47.224]: 
  about that.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:24:48.304 --> 2:24:48.507]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:24:48.507 --> 2:24:52.388]: 
  He's really good at looks at times though. I had no idea fucking he was another James Franco product.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:24:59.442 --> 2:25:02.007]: 
  And he said thanks Jeff for that awesome artwork.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:25:01.889 --> 2:25:05.669]: 
  He puts your face out of the text.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:25:03.222 --> 2:25:20.502]: 
  I need to run into my children. Although there was um, there was a documentary Coming out about the room and they came over to every beat and you didn't want to be in that. That's true So see sometimes yeah, you just gotta I know yeah, I'm guilty You're gonna get Jack Kirby to feel a sideline yourself but uh

 SPEAKER_04 [2:25:11.811 --> 2:25:12.840]:

I think Lisa We didn't treat Lisa very well control I love that like you get very little credit when it comes to the success of it or how funny it is But for anything that they don't like it would just drop Yeah When I was in the music for that it was on a fucking shitty like Windows XP in my mom's utility room Well, you nailed it

 SPEAKER_06 [2:26:26.939 --> 2:26:31.495]: 
  Listen, I want that soundtrack from this movie, The Room, but as like a Pokemon theme. I don't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:26:31.377 --> 2:26:33.435]:

 SPEAKER_03 [2:26:44.050 --> 2:26:46.007]: 
  Actually a really good like battle theme.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:26:46.007 --> 2:26:50.952]: 
  Yeah, it was cool. That was good times. Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:26:49.500 --> 2:26:56.217]: 
  Yeah, yeah, that was my first New Grants collab pulled proper and that look ugly you are

 SPEAKER_03 [2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:55.862]: 
  And that was how ugly you were.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:26:57.111 --> 2:27:08.249]: 
  What was the worst thing you were invited to? Ffffff Where's that? Wow, you got a, you're like sorting through them right now. Um... Like you flew out there... Mix birthday party. You have like a...

 SPEAKER_05 [2:27:06.561 --> 2:27:06.645]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:27:07.692 --> 2:27:54.992]: 
  Well, I guess in terms of like, you making an effort for something, like we did a Newgrounds booth at Wizard World in Philly. Okay. And that's gotten big now. And I think they even took on like a Comic-Con name. Everyone renames their convention Comic-Con because no one owns that. So when you hear that there's Comic-Con in your town, it's not actually the same event as what's in San Diego. It's just that anyone can call their event Comic-Con. But when we went, it was like, I think it was actually their lowest year. I think they'd actually been in decline before they had like an upswing. And, you know, we set up a booth and it was just like, I don't know. Is this the worst thing? It's like the emptiest booth. That wasn't that bad. But as far as, you know, going out to do something. I was hoping like, you know, you went there and you were like,

 SPEAKER_02 [2:27:47.247 --> 2:27:49.373]: 
  I wasn't that bad

 SPEAKER_02 [2:27:53.305 --> 2:27:57.743]: 
  I was hoping like you know you went there and it was like just a dark room and they kidnapped you

 SPEAKER_06 [2:27:54.992 --> 2:28:08.307]: 
  and it was just a dark room and they kidnapped you. I would suspect getting paid to go out there, they're like, oh, we've got a place set up for you and then you come out there, it's a long flight, like 12 hours and then you go there and you just completely point lose.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:28:08.475 --> 2:28:14.078]: 
  Yeah, I mean, all that, all the conventions I've gone to have all worked, like everything I've flown to, I'd say has worked out. So, you've been to a lot of...

 SPEAKER_06 [2:28:12.914 --> 2:28:34.446]: 
  So you've been to a lot of conventions. Sorry. You've had a lot of good things from New Bruns. What's the worst thing that's come from New Bruns? Like what's a bad situation? Legal trouble? A fight? What's the worst thing that's come? May I make a suggestion? I don't know. Can I say I do recall very, very big. Like you guys had some legal runnig with your gears of work cartoons and stuff. That wasn't that bad. That was sweet.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:28:15.040 --> 2:28:15.614]: 
  ≫

 SPEAKER_01 [2:28:22.262 --> 2:28:24.169]: 
  What's what's the

 SPEAKER_01 [2:28:32.995 --> 2:28:33.501]: 
  there

 SPEAKER_05 [2:28:33.501 --> 2:29:08.955]: 
  So, so, so, so, okay, what's the worst thing? Okay, a lot of stuff is like cease and desist. What's a real nightmare if you have a website is things involving use of pictures, that other people's pictures, if they have like a copyright lawyer. So we had an instance where we had some clip art on the site that was from Corbis. And so they basically just came at us and did like. My bad. Yeah, they did. And they did a $10,000 shakedown. And basically they went $10,000. Then you talk to lawyers and the lawyers are like, that's actually.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:28:34.446 --> 2:28:34.902]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:29:08.804 --> 2:29:12.854]: 
  We just use them, I mean I'm manipulating them, I mean they were changed.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:29:12.516 --> 2:29:14.507]: 
  Yeah. Who is that that you use?

 SPEAKER_05 [2:29:14.507 --> 2:29:22.523]: 
  What the fuck is Corbus? They're a company that owns lots of... They represent lots of photography of stock images. What was it?

 SPEAKER_02 [2:29:19.080 --> 2:29:28.767]: 
  Lots of photography of the stock images. There's like three 100 by 100 pixel completely Here's the one. Here's the picture. They're the same thing.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:29:25.341 --> 2:29:27.113]: 
  Here's the one you're not matching.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:29:27.062 --> 2:30:23.408]: 
  They're the same thing. I'm doing reading the newspapers. Here's the worst part of it. It was part of NGMAG, and we no longer even linked to it. It was officially dead, because we wanted to redo it at some point, but it was officially dead. We weren't linking to it anymore. It could have just been deleted at any moment, and because we didn't delete it, they ended up finding it, and then sending the sync. So you talk to the lawyers, and they're like, it's really hard to win against someone that owns a photo. Like, there's not really any sympathy and court for that. So you're going to have to spend to do some money. So then the lawyers go back and forth, and then they get it knocked down to like $7,000. Meanwhile, are you paying these lawyers to do that? Yeah. As soon as you involve lawyers, you'll spend just as much or more when it's all done. So the only real reason to involve lawyers is if you don't want to give someone else the satisfaction of getting the money, and then you essentially give it to the lawyers instead. Could you have just bought the pictures? No, because once they catch you, then it's They want the big payday. Yeah, they want the big payday.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:30:01.673 --> 2:30:04.609]: 
  like 7000 meanwhile are you pay me so you're yeah that

 SPEAKER_06 [2:30:23.290 --> 2:31:27.955]: 
  They're similar, I don't know if I'm actually legally allowed to say this because I think we had to sign something but Masterphile they're notorious for that and I did some research on them while they were trying to sue us and Essentially what I discovered was is because stock photos are becoming there's just more and more places to get free resources So these stock photo sites that are used to these Exorbitant amounts for the the rates that they would charge to like a major magazine like a fortune 500 company magazine or whatever they They end up spending less time Gathering images and doing anything like back end like making sure the site runs and all that and they actually spend more resources In time going to court with people like that's actually where a huge chunk of their money Comes from because it's not coming from images anymore Yeah, and so they'll just take people to court and they'll try I mean they that's the things like you said $10,000 It's like they will just drop these huge numbers on you and when ends up happening is they try to act like they're doing you a favor By being like fine fine 3000 so you see that image they only said it artificially high to haggling death exactly. Yeah, there's a lot of malicious

 SPEAKER_02 [2:31:22.352 --> 2:31:23.584]: 
  So you see that image.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:31:25.677 --> 2:31:26.892]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:31:26.892 --> 2:31:30.503]: 
  It wasn't malicious or anything. They were completely harmless.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:31:30.503 --> 2:31:33.861]: 
  And then it just came after us, it was ridiculous. We can, sorry, go ahead.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:31:33.861 --> 2:31:51.006]: 
  Well, as I say, there's another case where it was a game that we sponsored. I'm gonna bring that out. Yeah, I won't name names, but they had used a photo and... The main character in the game was the photo. Well, but it was just... but not in the game, just the title screen. Was it that shark game? Alright, and that was said too much. Oh, gosh.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:31:37.877 --> 2:31:38.772]: 
  Yeah, I won't name names.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:31:40.999 --> 2:31:41.995]: 
  The main character in the game.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:31:44.104 --> 2:31:44.948]: 
  Well, but, but

 SPEAKER_06 [2:31:46.686 --> 2:31:48.053]: 
  Was it that sharp? Was it that sharp? Was it that sharp?

 SPEAKER_06 [2:31:50.196 --> 2:31:58.515]: 
  Oh, shit. We'll cut that. We'll cut that. Just do it again, sorry.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:31:52.980 --> 2:31:52.997]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [2:31:52.997 --> 2:31:55.073]: 
  We'll cut that. We'll cut that.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:31:58.330 --> 2:32:50.170]: 
  So yeah, this so one example was a game that we sponsored where his title screen used an image that was owned by somebody And that was an interesting one because as a sponsor You're kind of off the hook because you can be like oh, we just advertise ourselves on this game But you're a good guy, but I'm a good guy. Yeah, so I took care. I actually I actually paid there They hit for that one. Yeah, I took the hit and I bought the license that was an expensive one What was the hit 10,000? Oh, Jesus and and and then I bought the license so that it wouldn't have any problems moving forward But um because I figured he's gonna start finding it on other websites or whatever You know, even if you edit the new grounds version, it's gonna end up being everywhere. Yeah, but um and then similar to that is the patent troll companies that try to You know, they accumulate patents and their whole business is accumulating patents and then just suing people getting licensing fees, right? So we were some sneaky shit, too

 SPEAKER_02 [2:32:10.395 --> 2:32:11.290]: 
  So, let's go.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:32:12.623 --> 2:32:13.011]: 
  God.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:32:15.812 --> 2:32:16.504]: 
  Hey there.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:32:16.504 --> 2:32:18.495]: 
  Yeah, I took the hit and I...

 SPEAKER_02 [2:32:50.001 --> 2:32:50.879]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_06 [2:32:50.170 --> 2:33:07.450]: 
  That's the same thing is it's not the same thing in a smaller version of that is those people who sit on websites They just buy up all these different website names And then if you want something if you're a company they'll if you're a large enough company They'll be like we want a million dollars for this and do it's weird to me Tom. Can you see you can mention this? Yeah, you know that you're mentioning

 SPEAKER_01 [2:33:02.877 --> 2:33:03.349]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_07 [2:33:06.387 --> 2:33:08.445]: 
  Yeah, you're measuring to the one...

 SPEAKER_05 [2:33:07.450 --> 2:34:25.817]: 
  I know the one patent troll website you went to, how about it's like these people like are smiling and it's almost like they're proud of this. Yeah, a lot of them, well here's, I'll tell you all about some patent trolls cause there's some things that people don't know about. So there's a court in Texas with a judge that is very friendly with the patent litigators. So what they always do is they always set up a location in that town and then they run all their lawsuits through that town and I'm sure this judge has made a fortune off of it and he should be like disbarred or whatever. But that's as far as I know that might still be happening unless that's actually changed. But that's how that's exactly what happened with us. It's like they were gonna use that courthouse. And another thing about patent trolls a lot of people don't know is they view here an ad on the radio for a company and it's an ad that says how they're like a great company doing cool stuff and they're looking for talented people. Patent trolls actually run those ads to build positive reputation so that juries when they go into court, a jury will be like, I hear they're out on the radio. They're doing this and this. So there's a lot of stuff but it's like, yeah, it's anyway. That's dirty. So in our case it was. How did you find that out? I just hear things. But anyway.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:34:12.689 --> 2:34:13.819]: 
  Oh, right.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:34:17.262 --> 2:34:18.460]: 
  That's dirty.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:34:22.999 --> 2:34:28.332]: 
  But anyway So anyway You're like I didn't just drop 10k for no reason

 SPEAKER_04 [2:34:28.332 --> 2:34:29.007]: 
  No reason.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:34:28.551 --> 2:35:34.380]: 
  But our case it was someone they had a patent for running ads while you're listening to music online and So they were trying to come after us But the thing that in our case is we had proof that we actually were doing that on the site a year before They filed their patent and that's the really crazy part You need to show that you did it a year before they filed the patent which doesn't make much sense Why wouldn't it just be a day before they found the patent? but um So it was interesting because we we our first thing was had the lawyer send them back the thing that showed The examples from the internet archive of where we had audio and ads but um But then it's just like the whole thing got thrown out because it was actually like they were trying to go after Some like streaming radio services, I think Huffington Post was named like they had a few they'd actually successfully Won against ten companies. They did like they named ten companies and one and they all settled and then we were part of like their second wave Yeah, but then it got thrown out and because of you guys I don't I don't think it was because of us I don't know it's kind of a mystery because it was like I was just waiting to hear what was next and that was basically like what's the general demeanor?

 SPEAKER_02 [2:34:50.303 --> 2:34:51.940]: 
  Why wouldn't it just be a day before the show?

 SPEAKER_07 [2:34:51.940 --> 2:34:52.193]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:35:25.504 --> 2:35:26.449]: 
  because of you guys.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:35:34.380 --> 2:35:36.507]: 
  in the back and forth with these types of people.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:35:36.507 --> 2:36:18.829]: 
  Well with when it's someone that serious I've learned to just you once you once the lawyers initiate discussion They're not allowed to talk to you anymore So I get to like nervous because it used to be Like when the Charlie Brown thing on the site So we had a Charlie Brown cartoon on the site and the king or whatever that owns Charlie Brown Sent the takedown notice and it was the same month that Mad Magazine had Charlie Brown on the cover choking Lucy or whatever So I sent them back the cover of Mad Magazine and said you know It's like a parody just like this you know Yeah, but that just made him mad and like then then I actually like got the lawyers involved and the Basically came down to lures are like you have to take it down or we're gonna go to court. All right

 SPEAKER_06 [2:36:17.985 --> 2:36:22.592]: 
  What did make it apparently?

 SPEAKER_05 [2:36:22.187 --> 2:36:56.005]: 
  Well, what it is is if a company, you know companies have a lot of money they know that Even if you would win if it went they know that we would win in court But they also know that we could not afford it would cost $100,000 to win call your bluff. Yeah, it's like you have to you know Let's say if someone says that what you made could cause confusion Then you have to pay five figures for a study right to prove that the general public is not confused Between what you made these things that that people don't understand it's like once it goes to court They'll yeah, they'll basically bankrupt you and that's how it's funny. It just is

 SPEAKER_01 [2:36:34.557 --> 2:36:35.924]: 
  my

 SPEAKER_06 [2:36:35.924 --> 2:36:37.459]: 
  $10 to win.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:36:45.272 --> 2:36:45.458]: 
  great.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:36:47.989 --> 2:36:50.267]: 
  between what you made. There's a lot of these things that...

 SPEAKER_06 [2:36:56.005 --> 2:38:45.152]: 
  Just a side note, we have some friends that have had YouTube networks, like the aggregate networks, and I don't need to name names, but there is one in particular that a lot of people were with for a very long time, and when they tried to get out, it's so weird because they wanted to get out because clearly the relationship, there was no relationship, things weren't working out, so people wanted to bail. But due to some of these lifelong contracts and other things- Dude, I know what you're talking about. Okay. I'm not going to lay names, but I will say that the contract was, oh, like, really? And when they brought it to court that it was actually against the law. Sure. No, no, no, I know that, but I know that part of their process in order to- how do you say this? Intimidate? Basically, no, bleed people. So what they would do is, is that they would make it so you had to get a lawyer in order to get out of this, right? But the thing was, is that I guess there's like a 30-day grace period between correspondences, so like, they have to respond within X amount of days, whatever it is. And what they would do is they'd always wait until the very last day in order to do the response. So that means if you're just some lowly content creator and you have a lawyer trying to help you out, that time, that the clock is ticking. So like, they would literally just bleed you out. So every email, and you know, like they needed clarification on something. It's like 30 days, 30 days, 30 days, 30 days. So you think you eventually would just have to drop the lawyer? Well, I'll tell you what I always look for me is I always look for a project, I always look to make sure that they don't have a clause where it says you can't say anything bad about us. Because that always works pretty well. But there's not a clause that says you can't bad about us. All you have to say is like, dude, look, I can tell everyone what a piece of shit you are. And that usually scares them. And that worked with, you know, specifically the network you're talking about. That's what I did. I was like, listen, I will ruin you. Oh yeah, that's right. They might let me go that week. They fucking let me go that week.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:37:18.179 --> 2:37:18.972]: 
  other things.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:37:19.647 --> 2:37:20.035]: 
  Okay.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:37:20.997 --> 2:37:21.284]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:37:28.759 --> 2:37:30.447]: 
  Sure, no, no, no, I know that, but I...

 SPEAKER_05 [2:38:15.452 --> 2:38:15.672]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:38:17.309 --> 2:38:17.511]: 
  We'll see you next time.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:38:38.858 --> 2:38:39.465]: 
  That's what I did.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:38:42.317 --> 2:38:43.448]: 
  Oh yeah, that's right.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:38:42.992 --> 2:38:43.667]: 
  Go that way.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:38:45.152 --> 2:39:43.337]: 
  The real genius of YouTube introducing networks. I'll say there's like three points of genius. The first is they eliminated all their personal legal liability by allowing other companies to take responsibility for what people upload on YouTube. You mean YouTube eliminated it. So YouTube, if you upload something that gets you sued, it's your network. This is now their problem because they're a company that has resources. The second thing is they eliminated all the financial and tax liability of how you pay people. So let's say you have a guy in another country getting US-sourced ad revenue and you're not withholding the proper amount for the IRS because you're an American company. If you give that money to another American company and they do it and they do it wrong, that's them. That's on them. So it's not even like they don't have to worry about all the paperwork. They don't have to worry about dealing with all the individual people.

 SPEAKER_07 [2:39:02.500 --> 2:39:04.677]: 
  You mean YouTube. Yeah, eliminated.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:39:04.677 --> 2:39:05.335]: 
  So YouTube

 SPEAKER_06 [2:39:43.337 --> 2:39:49.935]: 
  So far the way you're describing this, it sounds like laundering money. Like the way you funnel it through these filters.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:39:46.814 --> 2:39:51.994]: 
  Like the way you funnel it through these filters. Yeah, they're letting it be other people's problem. Right, but they collect all the stuff.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:39:49.935 --> 2:39:50.357]: 
  I'm letting it be.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:39:51.994 --> 2:39:54.779]: 
  the goods but then they don't have to deal with it.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:39:54.002 --> 2:40:18.809]: 
  And then the third was that all these networks came along and raised millions of dollars and then actually used venture capital to boost people's CPMs So that like when people early on were getting the guaranteed ad rates That was just because these companies they'd raise like a hundred million dollars And they'd be able to just burn a few million dollars giving people a guaranteed rate because they want to It sucks people in it and then they just don't think you too I don't think creators are running jobs It makes everything YouTube amazing when it's all just like a house of cards It's here today

 SPEAKER_00 [2:40:12.042 --> 2:40:16.092]: 
  Boy, they made a lot of content. It makes everything YouTube's amazing.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:40:12.379 --> 2:40:12.447]: 
  and I'll see you next time.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:40:17.729 --> 2:40:54.077]: 
  It's a nice little bubble that's gonna pop. Pretty much the biggest networks, it's a scam, right? So, the ones who will accept anyone, if you're a little kid with 10,000 subscribers and they're like, come on to our network, we'll help you out, it's a scam because their biggest clients are the people with millions of subscribers. Sure, right? And there's pretty much the ratio of community. So if they're offering someone with even under 100,000 subscribers, there's no way they'll ever help them out because their biggest clients are first. Their resources. Essentially all they do is they're getting big views. They're giving people to just kind of take 30%. They've got tens of thousands of clients that of course they're never gonna get to everybody. Their emails are so funny too, I like that.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:40:19.602 --> 2:40:20.310]: 
  Pretty much.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:40:36.308 --> 2:40:36.494]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:40:44.914 --> 2:40:45.944]: 
  That's exactly all that they're using it.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:40:47.783 --> 2:40:47.952]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:40:47.952 --> 2:40:48.779]: 
  30%

 SPEAKER_02 [2:40:52.255 --> 2:41:03.443]: 
  Their emails are so funny too. I like it when they say they'll just like flat out lie. Like they'll be like, we've worked with such popular YouTubers. Dude, my name is usually a YouTube.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:41:01.182 --> 2:41:04.945]: 
  Dude, my game is usually rebuild. The people I play with have seen the game build.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:41:04.945 --> 2:41:10.244]: 
  It's like we want some people like she's like pebbles like two spaces I know they like spells

 SPEAKER_02 [2:41:08.624 --> 2:41:13.619]: 
  I know they like spell spaz kid wrong and I mean over I'm like, do you work?

 SPEAKER_06 [2:41:11.104 --> 2:41:21.600]: 
  I mean over I'm like, do you work with these guys? And my favorite email is the one where they write when they're like recruiting people and they're like, we love your channel. Oh, your videos are crazy. Which one's your favorite? Oh, we love your videos. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:41:17.230 --> 2:41:18.850]: 
  of your channel.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:41:21.297 --> 2:41:31.945]: 
  Yeah, all your videos. Oh yeah, they pick a random title. Like they'll pick something like that I did that is it's clearly a piece of shit. Right. Like they'll just go through and be like, that's my favorite. And then that's the goal.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:41:31.945 --> 2:42:24.679]: 
  viewed one but I remember when what's his face he worked for the actual cartoon thing he did the bear with over bear so bows when he posted that one Twitter image of like the account there fuck I don't want to say again not names but there was a network that brought band TV anyways apparently an intern did it so the company you know isn't liable I guess but they had sent out all these tweets saying hey so and so we really love your channel please you know write us we want to talk and it was just like yeah no it was just like the whole screen and like we went through the account and basically they just shoveled in all these names copied and pasted and went and it was like of all the people to send that type of like it's just it's not not only is it not personal it does seem kind of just robotic yeah I'm

 SPEAKER_04 [2:41:39.404 --> 2:41:41.361]: 
  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:41:41.361 --> 2:41:42.441]: 
  So about

 SPEAKER_02 [2:42:24.679 --> 2:42:37.808]: 
  I mean even if you're like three or four a day, dude, right? And what do you think of those people? Like fuck off and I think nothing right? They're a dozen

 SPEAKER_06 [2:42:27.514 --> 2:42:28.594]:

 SPEAKER_04 [2:42:32.037 --> 2:42:33.994]: 
  Right.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:42:33.994 --> 2:42:41.639]: 
  Yeah, they're just trying to take over my YouTube account and I click and I'm just gonna be redirected to a sign in YouTube page thing Actually

 SPEAKER_04 [2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:36.947]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:42:41.132 --> 2:43:01.500]: 
  I get nervous because like I'd say maybe like six times a year I might reach out to someone who I've seen like a video on like Vimeo or something I'll be like I Really like that like you want to show on new grounds, you know and then I always get nervous that they're just gonna be like So this is how that fucker does it just

 SPEAKER_03 [2:42:59.391 --> 2:43:00.454]: 
  people

 SPEAKER_06 [2:43:00.454 --> 2:43:05.820]: 
  Just emails everybody, you know, but uh, world's people.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:43:06.546 --> 2:43:25.007]: 
  Hey Tom, to go back to what you were saying before that went in the direction that it did, what were some of the, there's a lot of properties that you just, you should completely avoid? Now, I know one of them is Charlie Brown. Is it really that Charlie Brown?

 SPEAKER_06 [2:43:23.505 --> 2:43:30.947]: 
  Is it really that slowly breathes Marfs? Really? Godzilla. Godzilla is definitely one of the most horrible.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:43:25.007 --> 2:43:27.404]: 
  Really

 SPEAKER_02 [2:43:28.939 --> 2:43:37.917]: 
  It's usually not the creators. It's normally they have like crazy huge legal teams It's kind of it's like their job to go up Godzilla has

 SPEAKER_06 [2:43:36.854 --> 2:44:13.945]: 
  Godzilla has literally a legal team and they're known as the Godzilla of legal teams There's a there was an article about in some magazine these guys made a wine and they labeled it like What was it like? Something's illa they had zilla at the end of the name of your wine. Yeah, and then you really It wasn't Godzilla, but it was like you know wine. Yeah wine So something like that and they had like a silhouette of Godzilla on the label just the silhouette Which actually just looks like a lumpy turd to be honest if you've seen the silhouette and That's pretty he's pretty he's a big fat guy. Yeah, they say they

 SPEAKER_02 [2:43:53.138 --> 2:43:56.412]: 
  Go zero wide. Yeah, and then- Get you real wrong.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:44:13.439 --> 2:44:15.717]: 
  they sued those guys right out of business.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:44:15.615 --> 2:44:48.083]: 
  The same thing happened to Pink Godzilla. When we'd go to PAX, the first few years we'd go to PAX, we'd like hang out with this Pink Godzilla guys that they ran like an import game store in Seattle. Yeah. And so they just had their store, they had their mascot, which is like a chibi pink little dinosaur. Doesn't look anything like an official Godzilla. Right. But they were called Pink Godzilla and they had stuffed animals of it and everything. And yeah, they got them, they had to change to pink. And then the big old foot came down and smashed all of them. Yeah, they had to ditch all the stuff they had done with it and changed to pink gorilla. But when you said in person.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:44:25.150 --> 2:44:25.184]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:44:39.460 --> 2:44:42.329]: 
  And then the big old foot came down and smashed all of them.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:44:45.197 --> 2:44:51.239]: 
  Pink Godzilla? Pink Gorilla? When you said in Star Wars and Godzilla, I've seen like parodies of both of those loads.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:44:50.884 --> 2:44:57.938]: 
  Yeah, because Smurfs, we'd gotten a takedown as from the Smurfs before, but there have been Smurfs things since. Of all things, they're fucking Smurfs. Nobody did anything to catch them.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:44:56.605 --> 2:44:59.710]: 
  Nobody cares about the fucking smokes.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:44:57.938 --> 2:45:00.503]: 
  Yes, I really don't understand.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:44:59.710 --> 2:45:04.992]:

 SPEAKER_02 [2:45:03.659 --> 2:45:06.021]: 
  I mean, that's actually, that's didn't say

 SPEAKER_06 [2:45:04.992 --> 2:45:15.555]: 
  Didn't say I tried to go after Sonic shit. Yeah one point they did it never with us They were trying to shut down all Sonic parodies at some point

 SPEAKER_05 [2:45:07.574 --> 2:45:10.864]: 
  Did it? Did you say it? Really? Yeah, they were trying to...

 SPEAKER_01 [2:45:13.007 --> 2:45:17.445]: 
  I don't blame you. Just let it flourish. No, no, no, that's side-peer.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:45:14.442 --> 2:45:14.914]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:45:14.492 --> 2:45:15.505]: 
  Just let it-

 SPEAKER_06 [2:45:17.496 --> 2:45:22.305]: 
  He needs to crush that we got one good sonic parody. That's my

 SPEAKER_07 [2:45:21.344 --> 2:45:23.453]: 
  That's what I thought.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:45:22.305 --> 2:45:29.444]: 
  Wait, did you see that one recently where he hung himself and then his coins all spilled out But then they like auto-collected

 SPEAKER_07 [2:45:27.638 --> 2:45:31.148]: 
  Fuck you, Toliver! This is Toliver!

 SPEAKER_06 [2:45:29.444 --> 2:45:37.442]: 
  I really like that. This is Oliver, not C's Sonic. That's a classic one. Sonic is a classic. What about Mario vs Sonic the Reckoning? That would be awesome. That would be awesome. That would be awesome.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:45:31.384 --> 2:45:32.127]: 
  That's a clever one.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:45:37.442 --> 2:45:45.036]: 
  Anyway, what happened? Half of the food for us is the best. You still love those sprite cartoons.

 SPEAKER_07 [2:45:40.463 --> 2:45:48.411]: 
  No way dude, there's a logo of Spritecats dude Dude, could you come in? They're taking like two steps from now Yeah, no dude, you know what, tongue

 SPEAKER_06 [2:45:45.036 --> 2:46:07.075]: 
  Well, that's for now. Yeah, no, you know what, Tom? In the golden days when I used to go on Newgrounds, I remember I used to just blam sprite animations. I fucking hated them. So I'd come on and I would see all these people who put effort, and then I would see these retards with their fucking sprite cartoons and text because they can't use actual voices. And I would plan it and leave scathing reviews.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:45:55.127 --> 2:45:55.617]: 
  So I...

 SPEAKER_05 [2:46:02.080 --> 2:46:02.519]: 
  Thanks for listening.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:46:04.189 --> 2:46:11.547]: 
  The worst was when they used anti-aliased fonts with sprite art. Like at least get a pixel font with sprite art.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:46:08.070 --> 2:46:09.454]: 
  Zero art.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:46:10.821 --> 2:46:32.657]: 
  Well, Corey was like Newgrounds biggest like one of like biggest enemy Oh, I was gonna say Corey, you were fucking... I would go on there and I would just like pinpoint I have my fucking gang of goblin friends And they'd be like we like find an animation and we'd be like look at this fucking horrible dribble shit And we'd all leave reviews and ruin his day. Did you, if I can say this legally, did you call the FBI at some point or one of those guys?

 SPEAKER_01 [2:46:14.804 --> 2:46:15.006]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:46:15.006 --> 2:46:17.605]: 
  Down with Shuichi just really not for you

 SPEAKER_05 [2:46:32.590 --> 2:47:23.485]: 
  Okay, so someone registered nevgrounds.com with two v's instead of a w and new and in your URL bar It looks like any w. Oh, and they created a fake new grounds And it had a login bar and if you logged in it saved your info and then they then emailed they spoofed You know because you can email as anybody basically and spoof some so they emailed everybody's Wade and all the moderators and said at first Glance looks like it says no. Yeah, we've been having a lot of you know hackers and hacks and stuff So please go update your password And so all them you know moderators would go and do that and then that's how the entire art portal vanished one day Oh my god We had there's the ability to like turn basically just like prune the whole art portal. So what do you how do you feel about that? It's just annoying that someone went that far to do that. What's it? You're something really this is this is actually a big

 SPEAKER_04 [2:46:55.135 --> 2:46:55.506]: 
  at first.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:46:55.506 --> 2:46:57.413]: 
  We've been having- Looks like it says no to it. Yeah, we've been having-

 SPEAKER_06 [2:47:22.810 --> 2:47:26.927]: 
  I'm just wondering if you, if there's as annoying as it is, do you find it kind of

 SPEAKER_05 [2:47:26.927 --> 2:48:11.444]: 
  Sometimes or is it so funny? Yeah, I try to have good sense This is an important thing though the best thing about new grounds not being as like center of attention nowadays is People still fuck with it some but it's not Nothing like like if people only understood so imagine like you know, it's like 2005 and We're trying We're just this small team trying to do something huge and like we're just trying to make awesome stuff and be like this great thing and So much of our day was spent by Kids that just wanted to tear it apart because it was like the biggest thing to them Like they thought it was the biggest thing and they just wanted to destroy it. Do you think do you?

 SPEAKER_02 [2:47:26.944 --> 2:47:28.834]: 
  Sometimes or it's so funny.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:47:30.218 --> 2:47:34.825]: 
  Some of the times funny when half of my sight disappears. But no, this is an important thing though.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:47:44.444 --> 2:47:45.760]: 
  It's nothing like

 SPEAKER_06 [2:48:11.444 --> 2:48:20.607]: 
  You think if you guys didn't have to spend your resources plugging holes in the hole of your ship way back when, that the site would be in a different place today?

 SPEAKER_05 [2:48:20.573 --> 2:48:37.347]: 
  I mean we definitely would have been faster with features if we weren't doing damage control and and moderation tools There's so many sites that launch they don't even build the moderator tools We need to build because they never becomes a problem for them It's like you build the tools as you find the problems, but so many sites just never even what was the problem

 SPEAKER_03 [2:48:27.002 --> 2:48:27.306]: 
  We'll see you next time.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:48:36.824 --> 2:48:39.321]: 
  What was the most kind of frequent stuff that you have to deal with?

 SPEAKER_05 [2:48:39.827 --> 2:48:54.829]: 
  There'd be like the spam submissions in the portal, but there'd just be like the general... What if... Yeah, sorry, like... Like they would, yeah, they'd try to blam stuff, they would try to steal awards where they'd like... Yeah, no, that happened all the time. They'd like, swindle the voting to steal the award.

 SPEAKER_03 [2:48:49.800 --> 2:48:50.813]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you would, you would.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:48:51.825 --> 2:49:21.002]: 
  Yeah, no that happened all the time. Like special things like special special days where you had like Christmas days or like just a special holiday. I remember I would just I wouldn't want to submit anything because some stupid assholes would just upload something at the last second of like the cats getting stepped on or fucking guys getting kicked in the balls and just like that's it. They just do that with like loud static noise and screaming in the mic. If there's any feature on the site that allows spam. A lot of times it was the same video. Wasn't there like a video that they...

 SPEAKER_03 [2:49:11.991 --> 2:49:13.037]: 
  Awesome.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:49:16.480 --> 2:49:22.200]: 
  If there's any feature on the site that allows spam. Wasn't there like a video that they kept re-uploading?

 SPEAKER_04 [2:49:21.002 --> 2:49:23.939]: 
  kept re-uploading

 SPEAKER_06 [2:49:21.694 --> 2:49:35.380]: 
  Uploaded Stepping on the dude's balls. Yeah, fucking hole. Yeah Do you think any of those people like do you think any of those people would want the site to actually go down or do you think?

 SPEAKER_03 [2:49:25.997 --> 2:49:26.166]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:49:34.317 --> 2:50:04.506]: 
  That's the thing, I think I'll have them like it. And the funny thing too is, so there was a lot of kids that would submit this horrible content and we'd sort of like, we let it exist, right? Cause we're just trying to be open. Who are you to judge what's good and what's horrible? But what's funny is, I'd say like, at this point it feels like half of the most horrible people have had me take their stuff down because now they're applying for jobs. Oh yeah, man. There's things on new grounds that tie them to their current identity. And so now they want it all removed. You just waited and said no. I know, I'd say like.

 SPEAKER_02 [2:49:48.779 --> 2:49:50.061]: 
  I'd say like

 SPEAKER_03 [2:49:56.440 --> 2:49:56.946]: 
  Oh, yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:49:56.946 --> 2:49:58.262]:

 SPEAKER_04 [2:50:03.139 --> 2:50:03.291]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_00 [2:50:03.291 --> 2:50:04.928]: 
  I know, I'd say like... No!

 SPEAKER_02 [2:50 --> 2:50:05.991]: 
  You're lucky that they are our first troll.

 SPEAKER_07 [2:50:05.704 --> 2:50:07.004]:

 SPEAKER_06 [2:50:47.048 --> 2:50:54.912]: 
  Do you think any of those people that were like, uh, kind of like trolley and weird back on the site back in the day are like either murderers in prison pedophiles or dead?

 SPEAKER_00 [2:50:54.659 --> 2:50:57.797]:

  Is that him or is that him? Yeah, no, yeah. He's shocked, though. You're gonna fuck this up.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:51:16.495 --> 2:51:17.507]: 
  that we started.

 SPEAKER_05 [2:51:18.942 --> 2:51:47.697]: 
  Horrible. He's still just stuck on the top there. Man, I feel like I'm going to tell it wrong. It was something where he was drinking with the neighbor, who was a little crazy. And then they got in a fight. And I think he stabbed the neighbor. And then police got involved. And he was running. He went home. He finished his Sonic versus Kirby parody. He was running from the police. And I guess he had a gun. And he was climbing over a fence. He was climbing over a fence, and his gun went off and hit the police officer. Ah. He was just walking like that.

 SPEAKER_00 [2:51:20.444 --> 2:51:22.215]: 
  Okay, he's stuck at the top there.

 SPEAKER_04 [2:51:46.482 --> 2:51:49.654]:

  chatting with people as it was coming out.

 SPEAKER_01 [2:51:54.818 --> 2:51:57.450]: 
  He would vote at his last six, which is the right to do good.

 SPEAKER_06 [2:51:57.450 --> 2:52:02.412]:

He posts a picture of him holding gasoline and then I think Rigg saw the New Grounds post when he said holy shit and he called the English police. He said yo there's this guy on New Grounds called Sir Tom 93. He's pretty cool but you better look out. He's coming to the door so the police fucking caught him and then yeah the police found him.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:01:40.549 --> 3:02:43.088]: 
  No, we had to somehow explain to who allowed that. No, we were calling you a faggot. We were saying this guy is a faggot We were like it was really hard to explain because he did come into Skype calls and he would like you would hear him like go like Like in the background what? It's from the heart of Africa. No, he would like say stuff and then he would come on he'd be like hey bitch Hey bitch Fuck you bitch like stuff to people just randomly But when he ended up like kind of patching with Axel and he drew Axel a picture of him as a black man Which is still on his new grounds page that he's never changed it. Well cuz he's dead now. Yeah, exactly So if you want to see look up Axel the Navy there's a picture of him and it's the one that hula drew Is he eating bananas and slices of watermelon? I think he's actually holding a water banana I'd pretty sure he is actually I can't remember. Jeff, you asked a question to Tauberleur. I'd like to answer it. Yeah, you asked the question Sorry, I kind of derailed it, but it was cool. I was a big part of new grounds He was always on all the things and he was actually like You love new grounds like he was always invested in all the people. He was in a couple of the collapse we did

 SPEAKER_04 [3:02:14.704 --> 3:02:16.662]: 
  Yeah, exactly. So if you want to see

 SPEAKER_03 [3:02:15.936 --> 3:02:16.442]: 
  if you want to see

 SPEAKER_02 [3:02:23.226 --> 3:02:23.800]: 
  I think he's...

 SPEAKER_03 [3:02:23.800 --> 3:02:24.441]: 
  That's actually a holy grail.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:02:24.441 --> 3:02:25.825]: 
  I'm gonna want him on a banana.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:02:30.347 --> 3:02:31.140]: 
  But yeah, you had to.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:02:41.114 --> 3:02:49.399]: 
  He was in a couple of the collabs we did. His final post though sound like he like really fell out of love unless he was just maybe the web in general. No, he was just really better with a read as a read.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:02:47.644 --> 3:03:09.480]: 
  No, he was just really bitter with the redesign because he was Yeah, no, he yeah, he was super bitter because he wanted to um, sorry I made it better No, he yeah, no exactly he wanted to be able to To release like shitty cartoons and he wanted people to blame it Oh, you mean from a technical standpoint Yeah, he didn't like the fact that he couldn't release trash anymore. Nobody would blame his cartoons

 SPEAKER_05 [3:02:50.445 --> 3:02:51.610]: 
  That's 2012.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:03:10.307 --> 3:03:12.974]: 
  That was so weird.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:03:10.392 --> 3:03:15.707]: 
  That was a weird thing that wasn't redesign related though. No, what is?

 SPEAKER_06 [3:03:14.880 --> 3:03:25.005]: 
  No, it was because like you remember the old design like when stuff is on the flat Oh, you had to click it this came in pictures now with like star ratings. Oh, he went to shock. Yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [3:03:19.960 --> 3:03:21.512]: 
  because you had to click it. This came in the wrong way.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:03:24.449 --> 3:03:26.001]: 
  Yeah, and then...

 SPEAKER_02 [3:03:25.005 --> 3:03:30.945]: 
  Maybe you should cry about it and then become a male nurse or something. Little bitch.

 SPEAKER_01 [3:03:26.001 --> 3:03:26.406]: 
  Maybe

 SPEAKER_07 [3:03:30.945 --> 3:03:32.498]: 
  kids I bet he love working with kids

 SPEAKER_05 [3:03:32.498 --> 3:04:04.999]: 
  I'm sorry Jeff. That's actually something else the project system changed was it used to be that you kept a portal buddy list And you could add your portal buddies to your submission So spam crews could submit stuff with like their we had a limit of 10 at the time So they put their 10 spam friends on every submission But when we changed it to the project system, we made it so you you could invite people ahead of time and they would just sign off and get on board ahead of time before you publish and But because we got rid of portal buddies They could no longer just lazily add 10 friends every time like instantly right and I think it just sort of killed off that whole

 SPEAKER_07 [3:03:34.152 --> 3:03:34.945]: 
  something else the project

 SPEAKER_03 [3:03:46.926 --> 3:03:47.618]: 
  submission.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:04:04.999 --> 3:04:09.218]: 
  Malicious yeah, we're fucking group. Yeah, which was kind of good things it was crazy

 SPEAKER_05 [3:04:06.197 --> 3:04:23.663]: 
  Worthless fucking group. Yeah, which was kind of a good thing. It always created the feeling of a group of bullies because like one person with with ten friends could all by himself Give the impression of a group of bullies like acting on someone they could like you know They could like say this user sucks and put up a flash and there's ten people on it It really looks like a lot of people. Yeah, you did have a good one.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:04:22.836 --> 3:04:24.996]: 
  Yeah, you did have to be careful with who your friends were.

 SPEAKER_07 [3:04:24.996 --> 3:04:28.489]: 
  because you never know. Yeah. Or knew, rather.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:04:28.489 --> 3:04:29.502]: 
  Is there anything any of us

 SPEAKER_05 [3:04:29.502 --> 3:04:31.004]: 
  Just in this group has made that...

 SPEAKER_04 [3:04:31.004 --> 3:04:34.497]: 
  You know, you're either disgusted or disappointed in us every night.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:04:31.493 --> 3:04:32.185]: 
  You're there to sky.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:04:32.944 --> 3:04:41.534]: 
  Oh, yeah, I can't extend this question Anybody surveyed or we've done or we said or done really keep motherfucker any piece of shitty trash you could be honest on

 SPEAKER_00 [3:04:34.497 --> 3:04:36.049]: 
  I'm gonna extend this question. Oh no.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:04:40.757 --> 3:04:58.442]: 
  You could be honest, Don. No, there's never been anything that's totally upsetting. There's just things that make me nervous. What? I think, OK, so I'll try and go in order. I think street life was the first thing, the first match with Sexy. To my recollection, I remember looking at street life and I'm being like, wow, it's like, we haven't gone this far. I was like, yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:04:45.482 --> 3:04:46.427]: 
  Like I think

 SPEAKER_05 [3:04:59.320 --> 3:05:03.792]: 
  So it was like, you know, but uh, so that was like a decision point

 SPEAKER_02 [3:05:03.792 --> 3:05:06.930]: 
  Oh no, there's boobies. What am I gonna do?

 SPEAKER_05 [3:05:07.757 --> 3:05:13.208]: 
  And then I guess with Jeff, he did the Pokemon.

 SPEAKER_07 [3:05:12.651 --> 3:05:13.866]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_00 [3:05:13.022 --> 3:05:15.942]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_07 [3:05:14.760 --> 3:05:16.364]: 
  Did that worry you?

 SPEAKER_05 [3:05:15.689 --> 3:05:26.961]: 
  You know what I thought about in retrospect. I thought maybe that's because we put that on our YouTube and I was like maybe that's why

 SPEAKER_07 [3:05:23.502 --> 3:05:25.493]: 
  Let's go like half this length, or maybe that's one of them.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:05:25.493 --> 3:05:39.989]: 
  That was one of those one of just best screams the timing after the pop And the look on his face, it's just genius

 SPEAKER_06 [3:05:37.829 --> 3:05:52.949]: 
  Genius, the timing, everything was so weird. It's weird because by the time that cartoon came out, I feel like so many other things were already quote-unquote okay for the site. Yeah, yeah. That didn't really seem like it was too crazy. I've got more hate for that than anything. Jeff, on YouTube, that has been...

 SPEAKER_05 [3:05:46.907 --> 3:05:47.430]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [3:05:48.460 --> 3:05:48.831]: 
  I see.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:05:48.831 --> 3:05:50.299]: 
  It was too crazy.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:05 --> 3:05:49.506]: 
  Oh, hey.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:05:50.299 --> 3:05:50.991]: 
  more hate for that

 SPEAKER_05 [3:05:50.991 --> 3:05:58.450]: 
  than anything.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:05:52.442 --> 3:05:53.370]: 
  I think you had it.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:05:58.450 --> 3:06:12.507]: 
  Wait, do you remember when I was like, let's do a Pokemon collab and you made that? When I saw the hate that got, I felt so bad. Dude, the Pokemon collab, what happened? I was kind of expecting it. I love it. I was kind of aiming for it. I kind of knew I'd get a lot of hate for it. I wonder how much.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:06:05.959 --> 3:06:09.537]: 
  I was kind of expecting it.

 SPEAKER_01 [3:06:11.494 --> 3:06:11.849]: 
  Whatever.

 SPEAKER_01 [3:06:12.507 --> 3:06:15.004]: 
  I started the Pokemon. It was me and Chris.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:06:13.519 --> 3:06:40.941]: 
  It was me and uh, it was me and someone else. I think it was me. I did a really cool, man. Well, I was gonna go talk to you. I got to be with Ash from Spooky Pokebox. Oh yeah, Poke, I was supposed to be part of it. So was uh, uh, uh, this video. Oh yeah, in the Pokeball. Yeah, that's what we all did Pokemon Cartoon. And I was the only one who did. And then people, people thought it was like a thing, like all the animators were doing, like make Pokemon Cartoon. Yeah, I thought that was a trip. Because nobody knew that it was like a thing. Well, now, now making a Pokemon, that's like,

 SPEAKER_05 [3:06:15.004 --> 3:06:22.497]: 
  someone else I think it was a very I did a really cool man you talk to you I got to be a master server oh yeah polka awesome was supposed to be

 SPEAKER_05 [3:06:23.121 --> 3:06:23.425]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:06:26.867 --> 3:06:30.006]: 
  Better get a new suit and get some new rubber bands

 SPEAKER_05 [3:06:30.006 --> 3:06:31.424]: 
  And I was the only one who did.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:06:37.482 --> 3:06:38.005]: 
  Because no

 SPEAKER_05 [3:06:38.005 --> 3:06:43.624]: 
  Nobody knew that it was a good thing. Now making a Pokemon, that's like your gateway into YouTube. Yeah, absolutely. You get all the YouTube search tracks.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:06:40.452 --> 3:06:40.890]: 
  That's like

 SPEAKER_01 [3:06:41.954 --> 3:06:47.134]: 
  Oh, absolutely. You get all the YouTube search traffic, right? But it's still around as a column. It's kind of disbanding people. Yeah, you know what?

 SPEAKER_06 [3:06:46.088 --> 3:07:02.946]: 
  Yeah, but you know what? You, you, Chris, and Aaron, and you motherfuckers here, you think you're all the motherfuckers first, and you're not. You know who did the first one? What? Pendleton Ward. Who's that? He did the farting Pikachu one. I didn't say we did the first Pokemon, cause I was like, oh Pendleton Ward, an ASM!

 SPEAKER_02 [3:06:52.382 --> 3:06:53.699]: 
  first and you're not

 SPEAKER_02 [3:07:00.938 --> 3:07:05.376]: 
  Oh, yes come in.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:07:04.532 --> 3:07]: 
  Just sit back.

 SPEAKER_01 [3:07:05.376 --> 3:07:07.317]: 
  I'm just gonna sit back. Okay bro, I made it first.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:07 --> 3:07:13.274]: 
  Okay bro, I made the very first Minecraft parody cartoon. That's true! That's actually true. I had this realization one day.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:07:09.848 --> 3:07:17.357]: 
  That's true! That's actually true. I had this realization one day where I was like, if Jeff had kept making those Minecraft videos, that could have been its own view.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:07:15.484 --> 3:07:16.497]: 
  Oh my god, you-

 SPEAKER_06 [3:07:16.497 --> 3:07:38.805]: 
  You would be God right now. You'd literally have more subscribers than the world. I'm a visionary. He's probably gonna be filled with autism pun bugs. You would be the most soulless asshole on the planet. Your ironic stab at shit would have, if you were able to continue that without killing yourself, you would be the biggest animation guy in the world.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:07:17.357 --> 3:07:17.459]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [3:07:21.492 --> 3:07:21.576]: 
  the world.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:07:21.576 --> 3:07:22.892]: 
  I'm a visionary.

 SPEAKER_03 [3:07:25.086 --> 3:07:25.947]: 
  It would be the most...

 SPEAKER_05 [3:07:25.947 --> 3:07:26.200]: 
  That's all.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:07:27.128 --> 3:07:27.938]: 
  Your

 SPEAKER_02 [3:07:38.502 --> 3:07:44.695]: 
  I'm the first person to do a cartoon with Street Fighter characters shedding and puking on each other. Yes. I also think you did the right thing.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:07:43.109 --> 3:07:53.504]: 
  Yes, I also think you did the first cartoon with Traceformers eating a peanut butter jelly sandwich. I did the first Pokemon cartoon with the nurse spreading her ass. I think everyone's ever done that. No, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:07:45.370 --> 3:07:45.572]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:07:46.467 --> 3:07:47.226]: 
 imbap

 SPEAKER_04 [3:07:47.985 --> 3:07:49.335]: 
  I did the first pose.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:07:53.504 --> 3:07:55.495]: 
  What? Spread your foot.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:07:55.191 --> 3:08:07.999]: 
  Dude, the nodding that is so perfect. Their heads going up and down and you can see like the eight necks. Really the only joke was their fucking kids. They're like children looking for pokeballs.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:07:59.764 --> 3:08:01.452]: 
  I can see like the eight necks.

 SPEAKER_03 [3:08:03.004 --> 3:08:04.641]: 
  It's a toddler now.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:08:07.999 --> 3:08:10.007]: 
  If you pretty much look at any street fighter video

 SPEAKER_06 [3:08:09.501 --> 3:08:16.504]: 
  If you've ever seen a video on YouTube, there's some me quoting Stamper's cartoon in the comments. Like it's that. Oh yeah, absolutely. Every fucking every one.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:08:15.019 --> 3:08:16.251]: 
  Absolutely. Every fucking every

 SPEAKER_02 [3:08:16.251 --> 3:08:41.057]: 
  A lot of people didn't know I made it because I made it and I'd sent it to a couple of people and I'd never put my name on it. Some scumbag with these things. And then it like, it leaked on a style project and it got huge. 4chan. 4chan. And nobody even knew I made it. Because the collab wasn't done yet. Everyone else was done with their pieces. So one of my piece of shit trustworthy friends started passing around. MEC! WHA-

 SPEAKER_04 [3:08:21.938 --> 3:08:22.849]: 
  with some scumbag with it.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:08:22.849 --> 3:08:24.098]: 
  It got leaked, really?

 SPEAKER_05 [3:08:27.068 --> 3:08:27.524]: 
  Thank you for watching.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:08:42.222 --> 3:08:45.411]: 
  Aha! It was Mick! You went to the computer with the keyboard!

 SPEAKER_04 [3:08:45.411 --> 3:08:46.997]: 
  No. Yeah, maybe.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:08:46.930 --> 3:08:53.342]: 
  Make when did you come on the new grand so I can't remember 2010? I don't think I really came home. Was he? Middle of 2010.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:08:48.972 --> 3:08:52.499]: 
  2010. I don't think I could have ran then, was he?

 SPEAKER_05 [3:08:53.241 --> 3:08:55.097]:

 SPEAKER_06 [3:08:55.097 --> 3:08:57.949]: 
  When was that? No... I... He started...

 SPEAKER_02 [3:08:57.443 --> 3:09:00.869]: 
  He started with Marvel, she came in for some Marvel cartoon.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:09:00.413 --> 3:10:09.499]: 
  Yeah, and everyone thought like my Marvel thing was just like this really shitty whatever But nobody knows that it was actually just a parody of Tom's Like I was and that was like one of my first like it was still within the pocket of my first submission So like I felt like I had to justify everything, you know like when your first anime no guys seriously Listen, I'm not this is what I normally do But yeah, it was supposed to be a direct rip of Tom's at the time I thought you're pretty cool. Nick and then I met you. Yeah, no, sorry to disappoint. I remember. It's okay Well, the first time ever I really excited was whenever I released that That Pico day cloud thing I didn't like 60 hours and then I won the award for the best dick joke I was like, I got a runner-up award it Because like I just wanted to like get something because I thought it was I was like it was nonsense I don't even know why I made that like it was nonsense. That's dick joke Yeah, oh, they're fucking each other. Yeah, I guess the one I was Really scared about was fucking

 SPEAKER_04 [3:09:31.851 --> 3:09:33.218]: 
  I remember. It's okay.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:10:00.572 --> 3:10:03.930]: 
  Oh, were they fucking each other?

 SPEAKER_03 [3:10:02.445 --> 3:10:04.943]: 
  I guess the one I was- I was in was just-

 SPEAKER_00 [3:10:04.943 --> 3:10:05.500]: 
  So when I was

 SPEAKER_02 [3:10:05.500 --> 3:10:05.854]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_02 [3:10:08.369 --> 3:10:13.009]: 
  I mean we've talked about it. Did he do a different one with Jeff fucking himself up?

 SPEAKER_00 [3:10:09.499 --> 3:10:13.043]: 
  It was less than you could do. Did you do a different one with Jeff's fucking pillow?

 SPEAKER_04 [3:10:12.992 --> 3:10:17.312]: 
  enemy there for is that in Street Fighter Child or was that something else? No, Street Fighter Child was something else.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:10:15.625 --> 3:10:29.952]: 
  No, Street Fighter Show was something else. No, this was its own submission. Oh, that's right. Showed was a scary day trying to... And that was all you? Yeah, but you just sat there by yourself, you're like, I'm gonna have Jeff and Tom fuck? Yeah. And you didn't even know what it was like. I can't even know what they were saying to each other. What I love is it now.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:10:18.274 --> 3:10:19.118]: 
  Oh, that's right.

 SPEAKER_03 [3:10:25.649 --> 3:10:29.007]: 
  Yeah. I didn't even know what they were saying.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:10:29.007 --> 3:10:34.997]: 
  What I love is that now you work in an office literally with Jeff Chipp and Tom.

 SPEAKER_03 [3:10:29.952 --> 3:10:30.947]: 
  how you work in it all.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:10:32.652 --> 3:10:33.445]: 
  He's saying when was the last time?

 SPEAKER_05 [3:10:33.445 --> 3:10:39.722]: 
  I'm sorry, cut your nails. Would you have ever conceived of that? When you were making that cartoon that it never...

 SPEAKER_06 [3:10:38.187 --> 3:11:03.702]: 
  When you were making that cartoon that in a few years you would be working in an office with this guy. No, not exactly. I just thought at the time it would be funny because everyone else would be making like Pico like fighting alongside you. And I would just make you do something completely the opposite. Is that the advice that you would give to aspiring creators? Yeah. To animate the people that you respect and want to work with in the future. It would make more stupid than that. Yeah, because you never know the higher view years later.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:10:39.064 --> 3:10:39.587]: 
  or two.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:10 --> 3:10:42.945]: 
  This one's too gross.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:10:55.517 --> 3:10:56.125]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:10:59.348 --> 3:11:00.850]: 
  I want stupid downbeat. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:11:02.892 --> 3:11:16.679]: 
  Well that's another reason we did that screening in LA this past year of like classic New Ground stuff and Strawberry clock flew out for it and got the CB on the big screen. So it's like rolling the site, you know, yeah, however many years ago

 SPEAKER_04 [3:11:12.426 --> 3:11:13.506]: 
  Das ist mich der

 SPEAKER_02 [3:11:13.506 --> 3:11:13.877]: 
  Right?

 SPEAKER_02 [3:11:16.628 --> 3:11:18.855]: 
  You mean just the letter B on the screen?

 SPEAKER_05 [3:11:17.927 --> 3:11:25.572]: 
  Yeah, like now you're getting to see your troll movie like in a movie theater with a bunch of people cheering and stuff. It's like

 SPEAKER_03 [3:11:21.589 --> 3:11:22.821]: 
  with a bunch of people cheering and saying

 SPEAKER_02 [3:11:22.821 --> 3:11:23.175]: 
  Stop.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:11:24.424 --> 3:11:28.997]: 
  That's why I'm gonna stay up there, cause it's just like one frame that never does anything. It's just a...

 SPEAKER_05 [3:11:28.997 --> 3:11:33.992]: 
  Big red letter B. It's not that long enough. I think I filmed it actually. I should probably put that somewhere. You're losing time.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:11:39.578 --> 3:12:08.350]: 
  I don't wanna like dive back into this, I think I've talked about this a lot, but one of the most scariest times for me was on Newgrounds was Cho'd, submitting Cho'd, because it was about to like lose to some shitty mouse game by some foreign country, and I was so fucking scared because these assholes were voting up the mouse game and all the comments were like, let this win, fuck that flash.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:12:08.350 --> 3:12:10.358]: 
  Oh, they were all doing it in spite of your flight.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:12:10.037 --> 3:12:32.954]: 
  Oh, absolutely. And then when it was on the page, I was like so happy, but that fucking flash for three solid days, it was bombarded with attention. Like people were coming, they were dropping zeros left and right, but then I would come back and they would all be gone. Like the zeros would be gone, there'd be tents and then e-refreshing. I thought it was great. I remember telling you.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:12:31.300 --> 3:12:36.565]: 
  I thought it was great. I remember telling Tom, I was like, dude, you need to put this on the front page. Yeah, tell me what. Wait.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:12:34.709 --> 3:12:39.450]: 
  Yeah, I'm gonna get that. I think that he did me. I felt really guilty about it. That was actually right out of the way.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:12:36.987 --> 3:14:09.394]: 
  I felt really guilty about it. That was actually right when I joined Newgrounds too, because I remember being like, wow, this is intense. Another thing is, I know nothing about street fighting. Cory. I still don't. Why don't we take this moment right now to give, why don't you give Rina to have a nice heartfelt apology? Oh, okay. Yeah, no. Play some, play some tag, he's going home. I'm sorry. I am, I am definitely sorry at this point because I never meant like for ronka chunks to be, I hope it's not something, but. People still call me, I call me. That's sad, but you know, that wasn't even me. So I'm going to throw Lyle under the bus because he thought of the name. Okay. So Lyle. You're going to throw Lyle under the bus? No, listen, okay. Lyle also had his fucking hand in the stink pile. When we were making the cartoon, Lyle wrote the crazy over the top fucking tank man, like Metal Gear Solid storyline. And I wrote this stupid bullshit that people quote randomly. And so like Mike, that's why it was like a parody of club, but it also had this like underlining like story. Did you, did we even mention the name of the cartoon yet? Oh, Street Fighter show? Yes. I think we just have like a code name show. That Street Fighter show. Watch Cory Boley people. No, it was 15 minutes. But it was, it was how I met like Zach. It was how I met Chris. I think I think we should have. It was how I met you. It was how I even kind of got your attention at the time. See the thing is that it was so well animated, especially for that time period on the site. No, I think for the site though, to see that, to see that, like just with the insanity that was there, I don't know, like it was impossible to just.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:12:41.492 --> 3:12:42.944]: 
  And another thing is...

 SPEAKER_00 [3:12:42.944 --> 3:12:43.079]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_03 [3:12:52.343 --> 3:12:52.360]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [3:13:06.670 --> 3:13:07.446]: 
  5 years later

 SPEAKER_00 [3:13:07.446 --> 3:13:14.297]: 
  I'm gonna throw Lyle out of the bus because he thought of the name. Okay. So Lyle McGoosh Bag. You're gonna throw Lyle out of the bus? Oh, Lyle.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:13:44.774 --> 3:13:45.870]: 
  Cause it screws your goal'

 SPEAKER_03 [3:13:52.502 --> 3:13:55.439]: 
  I think I think we should have told him that you

 SPEAKER_02 [3:13:55.439 --> 3:13:55.540]: 
  with

 SPEAKER_02 [3:13:58.155 --> 3:13:58.442]: 
  See you next time.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:14:07.690 --> 3:14:14.659]: 
  It was impossible to just- And it was so self-referential to the community. It was like a piece of content that existed because we had existed. It was. It seemed like it existed.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:14:12.162 --> 3:15:12.473]: 
  It's almost so bizarre. It was. It seemed like it was part of the, it was just part of the New Ground's lore or world. That's basically what it was. It's like, it's like 20 minutes long. Yeah, it's long. It's a fucking big- And then there's like- Isn't that your art piece that you did for the collab? You did the big- It's my favorite New Ground stuff ever. The best thing though, the best thing about it though, is I had this, I had this other little skeeting plan when I made it. That's why I had this like lesbian scene in between each fucking thing. So somebody had to fucking sit through that just to watch the next scene, and then they would be bombarded with stupid dumb shit, and it's not funny. It worked for me. Exactly. So they would have to sit through that. So I knew, see I kind of played the system. I knew I would get 10s from the fucking horny kids who were like, I hated it, but I liked the girl part. And I'm glad it was in the scene select, so here's a 10. And I was like, yeah. That was like a grand majority of the pictures. What are you doing here, Corey? You should be out in LA producing shows for fucking network television. Dude, I know that. Your little mastermind over here. You were a mastermind.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:14:18.659 --> 3:14:20.312]: 
  That's basically what it was.

 SPEAKER_03 [3:14:19.924 --> 3:14:20.498]: 
  It's like

 SPEAKER_05 [3:14:21.797 --> 3:14:23.873]: 
  Yeah, it's long. It's fucking big.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:14:46.789 --> 3:14:48.679]: 
  It worked for me. Exactly.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:15:09.790 --> 3:15:12.068]: 
  Dude, I don't know. Your little mastermind over here.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:15:12.068 --> 3:15:14.768]: 
  You were like bullying some kid at the end of the car.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:15:14.768 --> 3:16:07.992]: 
  I mean, I mean, who he is, but he's- That was Lyle again, Lyle. I like this good greasy hair. He was really harmless. Lyle just loved to make fun of him, and he's like, grease. See, I think- Tell him, tell him, just to describe the scene. The reason why it's okay that you're throwing Lyle under the bus is because if he was here, he would not apologize for it. Oh, he wouldn't. He would own up to it, but I'm so glad. I don't know, he would step right up to that plate. You're best Lyle impression here. My best Lyle impression? Look how Lyle would talk? Lyle, it's good to have you in the audience. Okay, so if Lyle was- What do you think? Do you apologize for stupid little Chod? Chod was fun, and he's like, but at the time, because there was also a situation where we were actually in a Skype call with, man, that was a whole other thing. Like after Chod came out, like fucking bridges were burned. Fucking and who? With who? People, they were supposed to be burned with. Yeah, like, like animators and friends of Raina Chan, who like-

 SPEAKER_02 [3:15:27.559 --> 3:15:30.462]: 
  The reason why it's okay that you're throwing Lyle under the bus?

 SPEAKER_03 [3:15:28.437 --> 3:15:29.449]: 
  That's okay that you're throwing left.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:15:32.790 --> 3:15:43.523]: 
  Oh, he wouldn't he would own up to you, but I'm so glad I'm finally right up to that play. But that's Lyle? Yeah, sure. Look at how Lyle would talk? Well, it's good to have him. Okay, so if Lyle was to talk...

 SPEAKER_01 [3:15:41.042 --> 3:15:41.076]: 
  MBC 뉴스 이덕영입니다.

  What fucking- I was like, precious moments, precious moments I'll never forget. I checked it recently, all the- like half the reviews are deleted. But also the thing about that was that uh, me and Zach used to fucking have him on Skype. Oh you gotta tell the whole fucking shindig about that stuff dude. He was basically just a 13 year old fan who was like, I really love your cartons. And then we'd fuck with him. So me and Zach, we came up with- We just fucked with him, we just fucked with him. Well we were nice to him at first, but then he kept being annoying. And he kept being like, well won't you like my cartons? That's usually how it happens. Yes, like okay, fuck you. So then we were like- I used to tell him stories where I was like uh, like I pretty much made out that Arlen was like a muddy hole that is surrounded by wolves and we live in cabins and shit. So he thought that my like fingers were all like-

 SPEAKER_03 [3:17:54.777 --> 3:17:55.536]:

 SPEAKER_05 [3:18:36.998 --> 3:18:47.950]: 
  all gone from wolves and my parents were dead and that we all had cancer and then one day we told him that uh or this was the day I was gonna block him because he was annoying me but like now he's a nice guy

 SPEAKER_06 [3:18:47.950 --> 3:19:02.766]: 
  But anyways, the day where he was annoying me, I was like, listen dude, I gotta go for a few months. He was like, what are you going? And it's like, I'm gonna be an astronaut. And he was like, no, you're not. I was like, I swear, you can ask Zach. And I was like, Tulsi, it's like, if asks, tell him I'm gonna be an astronaut.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:19:01.450 --> 3:19:03.593]: 
  asks, tell him I'm going to train to be an athlete.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:19:16.502 --> 3:20:04.343]: 
  days later I told Zach to tell him that I had died in a spinning around in a chair and test. And then we went through the trouble of me pretending to sign into my account as my brother Bert who doesn't exist. Basically you changed your Skype name. You changed your Skype name to Bert. Yeah Bert I don't know why but anyways we were like listen yeah it was really mean but they were just bizarre.

  No, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_03 [3:21:25.512 --> 3:21:25.529]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [3:21:25.529 --> 3:21:26.929]: 
  I always make it a shift.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:21:45.610 --> 3:26:53.950]: 
  strange sprite animations and dick jokes and Like cookie cutter make it yourself games. I don't know It was just like the home of the dick joke for the years. Yeah, no, it was really weird But in all of it there was clearly a sense of community which I thought was really cool Yeah, it was my favorite community It was definitely like its own lore which I thought was there has been a community like new guys for me since no I have not Still the definitive I've never seen a site like I'm sure like DeviantArt people would argue otherwise and No, I think I'm tourists would argue otherwise Yeah, no, and that's the thing is that like these other sites where they all think that they're kind of the center of the universe Including reddit the thing is is that they all seem to be very homogenous in their thinking like it's like well You're either you're either with us or you're you're against us kind of thing versus new grounds I felt was very open to a such a wide range of people and it wasn't just a wide range of people It was a wide range of people who could accept a wide range of people Yeah, like you know like me or Tom or or whatever like yeah, we're a little bit older I joined when I was 30 say there's like little groups here there Yeah, but I could still laugh at the dick jokes and I could still understand the hate and even when people would troll the site and like You know they plug their flash in and downvote things I still a part of me still thought it was kind of funny like even though I didn't appreciate it to a degree I don't know it's like I just felt like everybody understood and nobody it was a place where it was like nobody got banned Essentially essentially nobody got banned. Let's you really fuck them unless you really genuinely fucked up But I mean dude you're talking about a site where people are posting I'm gonna burn down my school and then the next post is hey, I just had some kids, you know It's like congratulations. You faggot. You know whatever. Yeah, but I don't know like it just seemed like everything I don't know if we enjoyed it a lot. It was a really bizarre experience on the internet I was gonna say it was a fun community was a fun place to learn How to be an asshole yeah, no Yeah, it's not so much that like I was a piece of shit I don't think of like things that could be like I could submit a cartoon and get like you know I like look for trophies and then review and comment on people. It's just that like Now I would like to have something like I want to work towards something instead of like putting something out there I'd rather have a big term goal of what I'm doing and then work up to it. Yeah with before it was like I was kind of I didn't know where I was gonna do I was just sort of releasing cartoons now and then and stuff and it's kind of funny too because at first when I first came In Newgrounds like I said, I just made really trolly shit loud noises like the awful shit I was no better than the people who did fucking clock Flashes I made those loud videos with the worst. Yeah, I was the worst But then like I When I released showed I kind of got this like realization where it's like anytime I worked on something I ended up putting more effort into it And then when I released it like people were like you should just keep doing this and I was like, okay And then I just that's what I did I stopped doing like really I cut I didn't want to do lazy animation I wanted to do really fluent stuff and then I started looking at like Harry show me how he animated Yeah, see I think that's the thing too is like because in other environments where people are quick to ban Like it's they don't like what you're saying or doing you're out Right, but I think with Newgrounds the thing that was so healthy was that people could be fucking assholes Or they could do stupid shit, but like if they put in time and effort into something, you know You'd get reviews like dude. What the fuck is up with these jokes? You're such a fucking troll, but do the animations amazing Oh, yeah, you know, I would if you'd like if you'd like to look at Look at look at Cory Yeah, I would I would always look at and it's funny too because I used to review and my first reviews I just be trolly jokie shit, but you start to see like the evolution of like, okay Well, I'll look at a cartoon and I'll be like I look like this look this Isn't funny It's like you aren't funny, but this cartoon is really good and you should keep animating It was just interesting because you know like sometimes with your friends like you'll call each other like faggot or retard Whatever you were joking around we're making fun of each other. I know you are But I think like you sometimes I think sometimes people especially if they're grown up They don't necessarily Understand the context of that type of behavior. Well, that's the thing too is You you're a little bit older if there's when you got Right, you have all these people who are 15 60 70 who would just fucking berate you right? It's a different different world almost it is it is a different world But I was gonna say occasionally I'd see like, you know like stamper and Jeff and some of you guys You know you guys made these cartoons that were clearly either kind of trolley or out there or not PC Oh, we got something or kind of right and yet and yet there were times I remember seeing certain projects where you guys would chime in and be like what the fuck is the shit or whatever And it was just the interesting Give a shot I like to say stampers reviews my favorite reviews. Yeah. Oh, he's all the reviews absolute and Chris's old reviews

 SPEAKER_02 [3:21:53.997 --> 3:21:55.127]: 
  I don't know, it was just like this.

I wish I could reply that person Yeah, I'm other fucking line of things. What I like about it too is you know It's obviously a review system, but the YouTube you can just cut whatever you want Oh, yeah, you have to think about what you say you can't just like you could do like a one-line thing like fuck fuck off Faggot that could be a review but but you know you're burning that when you do it Everyone knows everyone knows that you had one chance to say something and you chose to say in law faggot or whatever I had like so big so big thousand characters. You can like fucking write the novel you always wanted. Oh, yeah Well Tom is the creator in your guys. What do you think is that like the most critical review you've ever left for anything?

  comment.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:29:53.078 --> 3:30:27.840]: 
  In a review? Yeah. Nah, you're too nice. I don't know if I've ever zeroed anything with a review. Now that's the thing, I learned early on, like, and you guys have to experience this too, because people look up to you, like, I learned really early on that if I'm mean to a user, I've created, like, a serious enemy for life. Because it's different, it's different than just another kid on the site being mean. It's like, it's like, if you went to Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg was just like, Mick Lauer, like, more like, Nick, fuckface, get off my site. Oh my god! Where was this top of the whole podcast? Hello, welcome! Mark Zuckerberg's here for the rest of your life, right? I don't think that's what happens.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:29:53.567 --> 3:29:56.200]: 
  In a review? Yeah. Nah, you too, nice. I don't know, but I'm gonna...

 SPEAKER_06 [3:29:54.462 --> 3:29:55.002]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [3:29:55.002 --> 3:29:55.356]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_03 [3:30:09.379 --> 3:30:10.780]: 
  I've heard of this. It's different.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:30:19.352 --> 3:30:34.067]: 
  I'm not that site. Oh my god. Where was this taught the whole podcast? Hello, welcome. You're so good for the rest of your life, right? That's what happens. Dude, I'm gonna like Zuckerberg fucking call me out. I know. You can fat this photo, delete it, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:30:32.937 --> 3:30:37.442]: 
  Making fun of that man.

 SPEAKER_01 [3:30:33.949 --> 3:30:33.966]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:30:36.295 --> 3:30:44.007]: 
  Yeah dude, I would upload like you like hack my account and I'd just be like pictures of like photo shops of me sucking dicks and stuff

 SPEAKER_03 [3:30:37.442 --> 3:30:40.244]: 
  I would upload like you like hack my account and I'd just be like

 SPEAKER_01 [3:30:44.007 --> 3:30:50.436]: 
  I have a question. It's a nice little... Biggest thing you ever...

 SPEAKER_06 [3:30:50.436 --> 3:30:54.942]: 
  You appreciate it and that you think you did the best with Ludo. It's the biggest regret. I guess I'm gonna start again.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:30:54.452 --> 3:30:54.992]: 
  I guess youråt

 SPEAKER_00 [3:30:54.992 --> 3:30:56.494]: 
  Right? Because we're good also, yeah.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:30:55.937 --> 3:30:56.950]: 
  Also, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [3:30:56.494 --> 3:30:58.452]: 
  I'm losing this guy.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:30:56.545 --> 3:31:06.079]: 
  Loosing this guy. I was pointing at myself. Best accomplishment, getting this guy. Let's point at myself again. You sportnet is dead.

 SPEAKER_03 [3:31:04.560 --> 3:31:06.569]: 
  You were supporting that as did. Excuse me.

 SPEAKER_01 [3:31:07.784 --> 3:31:11.462]: 
  No, that's not true. I'll let him answer.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:31:08.307 --> 3:31:08.492]: 
  It's

 SPEAKER_05 [3:31:11.159 --> 3:31:37.450]: 
  Biggest regret is like just the whole decline of it all, like letting myself get too depressed with everything. You were getting depressed? Yeah. No. It's like, it's stuff. It's like you need, you feel like you need to project confidence and shit to like, and I feel like I like, kind of like wasn't able to project that and it might not, it probably would have been.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:31:37.450 --> 3:31:42.040]: 
  Do you feel like there was a pivotal time when that would have been helpful? It's hard to say because it's...

 SPEAKER_05 [3:31:40.504 --> 3:31:50.140]: 
  But we hope for it. It's hard to say because the way I look at it now is it's like what happened was going to happen no matter what rabbit I pulled out of my hat I think. Right.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:31:49.431 --> 3:31:54.409]: 
  Right. Soundcloud was always gonna come around. DeviantArt was always gonna come around. Yeah, YouTube and mobile. Especially...

 SPEAKER_05 [3:31:52.317 --> 3:32:22.675]: 
  Yeah, YouTube and mobile, especially like the whole, I mean, you know, besides the fact that YouTube like cannibalized so much video traffic, just mobile has cannibalized the web, like websites are dying. Oh, absolutely. So, that's what I tell myself now is like, yeah, it's not like there was some magic one, two, three, you know, working extra 20 hours a week and be, where a bigger smile or whatever, they could have, could have saved it, but uh, but it's always like, I don't know. Yeah, like, there's always like the what could I've done to have made it.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:32:22.675 --> 3:32:37.339]: 
  I think that's probably the most frustrating thing is because that question, it's not even like, man, I wish you could go back and kiss Jenny in front of the cafeteria instead of just letting her walk by. This is one of those situations where you don't even know what you would have done.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:32:29.205 --> 3:32:29.712]: 
  Peace.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:32:36.293 --> 3:32:55.902]: 
  what you would have done. One of the big things is like it's really easy to say if we never allowed porn on the site we would have had higher paying ad rates and we would have all those people that hate the site because there's like oh there's adult content. It's like but at the same time so many people love the site because it had all that content because it was that big. Yeah these are bad news New Guards.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:32:53.472 --> 3:32:54.450]: 
  Козыр, ну заборись!

 SPEAKER_01 [3:32:54.450 --> 3:32:54.940]: 
  He's new, really.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:32:54.940 --> 3:33:00.947]: 
  I don't know how I know this but if you type hentai into Google new guys on the first page Yeah, see you don't know

 SPEAKER_04 [3:32:59.867 --> 3:33:03.850]: 
  Yeah, see you don't know how you know how I know that

 SPEAKER_02 [3:33:00.947 --> 3:33:23.948]: 
  I don't know how I know that I don't know though, it's adult content If I have a joke that's legitimately funny that happens to have a pair of titties in it there's nothing I could do I can't put it on YouTube I can't put it on most websites because conflicts with ad companies and there's very few places that I could put that it's not necessarily porn it's just adult content

 SPEAKER_05 [3:33:23.948 --> 3:34:33.389]: 
  It just annoys me that so many people are put off. Like everyone's so fucking good. There was this, I got some email the other day, it was like, oh, see what your site, see what people are saying about your site on. It was some site for like guiding people through and it's like, I wouldn't go look at it and like every negative review is like, oh, it's great games and I mentioned, oh, but you know, the doors and porn, it's like, go somewhere else. It's like, it's like, come on. It's like, don't people realize that the internet is just one click to porn regardless of what website you're on. There's porn always hiding around the course. You can go to Google image search and type a porn word and you'll get more porn than Newgrounds has ever seen in its entire existence. You could type a non-porn word. Yeah, that's true too. Type it in the mouth and you'll get all sorts of fun shit. People need to accept that the internet just has porn a click away from wherever you are and it shouldn't be a big deal that Newgrounds also has it too. But anyway, that is one of the big questions is like, what would have happened, would we have been taken more seriously, but also the offensive content. I kind of screwed things up when I made Pico and Club of Seal too. Because people were like, it was just...

 SPEAKER_02 [3:33:59.757 --> 3:34:01.849]: 
  There's porn always hiding around the course.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:34:07.722 --> 3:34:07.755]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [3:34:07.755 --> 3:34:07.958]: 
  tired

 SPEAKER_02 [3:34:09.915 --> 3:34:14.100]: 
  Yeah, that's true too. Type in mouse and you'll get all sorts of fun.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:34:32.815 --> 3:34:41.084]: 
  You call both of these things the porn and pico some kind of a possible regret, but I think that is what's solidified.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:34:37.995 --> 3:34:45.994]: 
  That is what's solidified. Yeah, that's what made it what it is, but it's also what held it back commercially. And commercially is why it failed recently. Well, if you wanted to go...

 SPEAKER_03 [3:34:40.442 --> 3:34:40.695]: 
  It's awesome.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:34:45.994 --> 3:34:53.504]: 
  commercial we could have just done a whole lot of bitch work and man shit that we don't particularly like doing or man then you'd really be fucking miserable

 SPEAKER_06 [3:34:53.504 --> 3:35:02.937]: 
  Yeah, you go work at a bank if you don't want to deal with that. I mean, I don't know. I feel like, I mean, you're still making games, which is great, and Newgrounds does still exist, so.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:35:02.937 --> 3:35:26.899]: 
  But um, as far as proudest thing, yeah, the big thing you just launching the automated portal was like awesome Like in 2000 that that was really cool launch and like unveiling that that's what also cool Like features every feature was just so exciting to launch You know in the early days where nowadays we could spend a lot of time on a feature and it it could have like very minimal impact Okay, that's that every feature was like a game changer

 SPEAKER_00 [3:35:05.637 --> 3:35:07.949]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [3:35:07.442 --> 3:35:08.590]: 
  I mean just launching the auto-

 SPEAKER_06 [3:35:24.469 --> 3:35:35.539]: 
  Back then every feature was like a game changer. Feature was always my favorite part of Newgrounds. Back then it was always like trying to fight for a spot on the front page. It was always like what everybody wanted to do.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:35:28.654 --> 3:35:29.177]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:35:34.999 --> 3:35:39.505]: 
  I mean like features in like a new portal. Yeah, the audio. Yeah, that's a great

 SPEAKER_06 [3:35:36.653 --> 3:35:37.007]: 
  I knew it.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:35:39.505 --> 3:36:01.544]: 
  like one day we added co-author but I wanted but what's the great like the proudest moment like being what in the top 20 most influential sites of Time Magazine or when when your wife logged into Newgrounds and was like I gotta find the creator of the site and have his babies or I mean what I mean proudest moment of you being what in probably met

 SPEAKER_05 [3:36:00.818 --> 3:36:06.285]: 
  Well, he probably met in college. Okay. Unrelent, but uh... He's still at the mic.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:36:05.222 --> 3:36:08.496]: 
  When you saw the light birth, you saw the baby clear the bathtub.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:36:11.449 --> 3:36:12.495]: 
  She feels like that YouTube.

 SPEAKER_01 [3:36:12.495 --> 3:36:19.819]: 
  Zach, your face when you were singing a song. No dude, you were singing the chase coming out of the bathtub. The chase coming out of the bathtub.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:36:13.204 --> 3:36:13.761]: 
  You're so...

 SPEAKER_06 [3:36:13.761 --> 3:36:15.533]: 
  I love you, you were singing a song.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:36:17.912 --> 3:36:40.980]: 
  You look like you're staring at one letter of time and space. You think that the gate is going to break into the bathtub? You mean like horses? You mean like horses? What the fuck is anyone talking about anymore? I remember I submitted a video to Newgrounds of a horse. It was like two guys. It was two guys who were standing on a tree. And they were like...

 SPEAKER_00 [3:36:23.144 --> 3:36:24.460]: 
  he's taking the devil is gonnaも

 SPEAKER_05 [3:36:26.282 --> 3:36:26.738]: 
  where's the

 SPEAKER_03 [3:36:33.690 --> 3:36:35.952]: 
  comed

 SPEAKER_00 [3:36:35.952 --> 3:36:37.335]: 
  It was like two guys.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:36:42.212 --> 3:36:55.949]: 
  This is Tom's proudest moment of Newgrounds. It was a giraffe giving birth. No, listen. It was two guys sitting on a tree. It was two guys sitting on a tree. And he was picking his nose. And the guy's like, that's gross. And he's like, no.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:36:48.895 --> 3:36:50.194]: 
  You guys sitting up and talking.

 SPEAKER_07 [3:36:50.194 --> 3:36:52.270]: 
  12, 10. It was two guys, so they got a 20.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:36:55.442 --> 3:37:00.437]: 
  Anyway, stop

 SPEAKER_06 [3:36:57.484 --> 3:37:24.855]: 
  Hold on, hold on, hold on. Oh, he just discarded it. Let me finish. So the guy's picking his nose. He's like, it's gross. He's like, no. And then he pointed over there. And I actually took an entire YouTube video of a horse capped in birth with the fucking placenta egg and the blood and everything. And then at the end, the guy's like. The placenta egg. Yeah. And then the guy's like, that's not that bad. And then it was over. And then I submitted it and it got planned.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:37:00.437 --> 3:37:00.876]: 
  You did well.

 SPEAKER_03 [3:37:04.740 --> 3:37:05.719]:

  The top!

 SPEAKER_06 [3:37:28.551 --> 3:37:43.992]: 
  The only review was what the fuck was that a horse having sex? No wait Tom left that review? No, the only review it got was what the fuck is that a horse having sex? Alright. Okay guys. Alright Tom.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:37:43.992 --> 3:37:57.458]: 
  No, I don't know. I guess that's the problem is I don't have moments of pride. I just have moments of like... Well, Tom, we're all proud of you, so... No, like, feeling inferior and needing to do better. What was...

 SPEAKER_06 [3:37:49.392 --> 3:37:50.556]: 
  Just moments of like...

 SPEAKER_06 [3:37:51.855 --> 3:37:53.307]: 
  We'll tell them we're all proud of you.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:37:56.834 --> 3:38:07.887]: 
  What was the thing that happened on the site that made you feel the least inferior? What was the least shitty moment of running this goddamn company? Well, speaking of...

 SPEAKER_02 [3:38:07.178 --> 3:38:11.903]: 
  Well, speaking as Tom, I just kind of like the general feeling of being a guy.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:38:11.144 --> 3:38:25.977]: 
  Oh god, yeah, there's like lots of little moments like anytime anytime that anyone who's an amazing animator Makes like says how they started to animate because of new grounds like that's like a moment. It's a nice moment of pride

 SPEAKER_03 [3:38:21.606 --> 3:38:22.062]: 
  Like that's like

 SPEAKER_06 [3:38:25.977 --> 3:38:39.375]: 
  Is there ever a moment where you got in the car, you were driving home, the wind was blowing in your face, and you just sighed and you were like, holy shit. Wow, that's awesome. That everyone met at this moment. Thank you, Mick. Yeah. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:38:38.700 --> 3:38:43.037]:

 SPEAKER_03 [3:38:38.937 --> 3:38:40.962]: 
  야하는 것 없게take

  There you go. I'm out. Look at what makes you happy.

 SPEAKER_07 [3:38:46.598 --> 3:38:48.994]: 
  I'm leaving!

 SPEAKER_02 [3:38:48.437 --> 3:38:48.505]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_05 [3:38:48.505 --> 3:39:00.081]: 
  I would say one moment that felt like a pinnacle was it was so I guess this was late 2008

 SPEAKER_06 [3:39:00.081 --> 3:39:02.005]: 
  Am I the only one trying here? God damn it.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:39:01.904 --> 3:39:25.950]: 
  Dammit Tom! Spin it out! Castle Crashers had come out and was a success. Newgrounds was still hanging in there pretty well. And April was newly pregnant and we went to- Good job Tommy! We used to do a Tokyo Game Show. And I was there at the floor. Fuck your wife, real good.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:39:02.899 --> 3:39:03.439]: 
  Fill it out!

 SPEAKER_02 [3:39:15.994 --> 3:39:18.880]: 
  Good job Tommy.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:39:21.884 --> 3:39:23.554]: 
  your wife real good

 SPEAKER_02 [3:39:23.925 --> 3:39:23.993]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_06 [3:39:24.938 --> 3:39:28.937]: 
  So there's a boost that means you came in her dude

 SPEAKER_04 [3:39:25.950 --> 3:39:26.035]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [3:39:27.874 --> 3:39:31.975]: 
  Anyway, you came and your wife, you had some at our booth.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:39:31.249 --> 3:40:49.937]: 
  So at our booth at the Tokyo Game Show, and thinking about how when I was a kid, I always wanted to go to the CES show, like this was before E3. Like I always wanted to go to the CES show. Like it was the Consumer Electronics shows, where the video games used to be before E3. And I even, there was a fanzine where they had a contest where you design a game and the best game design would win all their swag from CES. So I mean- Wait, when was this? This was when I was like junior high or something. So I created a game, which is very prescient. It was called Violin Master. It was like comical, but it was Violin Master. It was basically like a tar hero. But, and I won the contest and I got this huge package of all this just the shitty flyers. You get at CES. And I like worship, like I would just like, I would just, I had them all out on my floor and I'd look through them all. And it's like I want to be like part of all that excitement of like the CES show. So now I was singing like here I am, like with a hit game with our own booth at Tokyo Game Show, which is like the world's ultimate video game convention. And I was like, this is like the moment when I need to like accept that like, I've accomplished like everything, everything you could want to accomplish in life. Cause like I wanted to make games. I want to go to these shows. You want to make babies. I've got my, you know, my kid on the lights. The Lester Virginity, yeah. Yeah. That's a great answer. That was a good moment. That was like the top of it all. Good answer. All the answers.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:39:38.219 --> 3:39:39.518]: 
  armor 120

 SPEAKER_03 [3:39:52.900 --> 3:39:53.710]: 
  I mean, when was this?

 SPEAKER_04 [3:40:39.205 --> 3:40:40.470]: 
  to make babies.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:40:41.331 --> 3:40:42.951]: 
  get on the late.

 SPEAKER_07 [3:40:44.487 --> 3:40:46.950]: 
  That's a great answer. That was a good moment. That was a great scene.

 SPEAKER_03 [3:40:46.950 --> 3:40:47.170]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:40:49.937 --> 3:40:50.005]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [3:40:50.005 --> 3:40:54.004]: 
  answer Tom Tom you've done it all man

 SPEAKER_06 [3:40:54.004 --> 3:41:05.007]: 
  You've done it all made successful games and awesome company now now now now now now now Do it again?

 SPEAKER_05 [3:41:03.100 --> 3:41:30.792]: 
  That's better. Well that's the neat thing about Newgrounds becoming a struggle is like a lot of people can have a hit and then they, that's just it. It never happens again. But I feel like what's happened here has created like a persistent struggle that is hoping, hopefully going to fuel another great thing in progress. That I feel like maybe that wouldn't have happened if, you know, if life was too easy. The bonuses.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:41:29.695 --> 3:41:39.685]: 
  The bonuses since it is all going downhill you don't have to try as much and life is a lot easier To stand for the speed of an expert

 SPEAKER_05 [3:41:37.440 --> 3:42:34.495]: 
  You can actually use it. You very skill it. When Newgrounds was at its peak, it was super stressful because at one point we had like 13 people in this office. And it's just really stressful. And it's like, I heard like another CEO said once like it stops being fun at 10 people. And so I think that's probably like a good way to look at it. Like when you're just, you don't have like, we didn't have like any middle management and I'm not really like a manager type. But it's like, you just got all these people and you're just burning money and you're realizing that things aren't nothing. It's not like we're making the thing that's making the money that's being burnt or whatever. It's like it's very stressful. So that is the thing about everything being smaller now is like, it minimizes the, it minimizes like what's hanging over you, the boulder that you're carrying on your shoulder. That makes sense. So I'm trying to, and it feels like it's like a recovery period. It almost feels like a trauma that happened that it takes like you're slowly coming out of it and slowly sort of like healing from. Well, I have.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:42:34.495 --> 3:42:56.972]: 
  have high hopes for the future mainly because of what you Jeff and Corey are working on because holy shit it's fucking amazing and I really hope that in some way I don't know how you can rope it back into the ground. The final episode is in ten years in the making.

 SPEAKER_01 [3:46:09.499 --> 3:46:13.937]: 
  Put a sock over it dude. No you can see it now it's fun.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:46:13.431 --> 3:46:35.504]: 
  Just throw a new ground steering. Alright, next up we've got Granite Overworld and he asked, Granite Overworld asks, Zach sort of offhandedly mentioned he was a huge LSD fiend on the podcast. I was wondering if he could go into more details about his experience.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:46:16.300 --> 3:46:16.739]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:46:35.504 --> 3:46:39.250]: 
  did an episode suicide cooking fun time

 SPEAKER_06 [3:46:39.250 --> 3:46:52.497]: 
  Yeah, to make it brief, basically, uh, you know, college and crazy college days with my buddy, we took it. It wasn't exactly pure, uh, whatever, but it was like a shitty chemical off-brand. It did the same stuff, but it wasn't- Brand-

 SPEAKER_01 [3:46:52.041 --> 3:46:59.129]: 
  X

 SPEAKER_07 [3:46:52.395 --> 3:46:53.442]: 
  Yeah, yeah, we'll see what happens.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:46:58.369 --> 3:47:01.137]: 
  We didn't have some weird name like CS 100 or something.

 SPEAKER_07 [3:46:58.504 --> 3:47:05.389]: 
  some weird name like Huh, they had the weird like medical names like yeah, it was like xd. I wait whatever so I did that

 SPEAKER_05 [3:47:02.436 --> 3:47:04.950]: 
  medical names like yeah it was like x do a little bit so

 SPEAKER_06 [3:47:03.077 --> 3:48:49.744]: 
  Yeah, it was like xD, yeah, whatever. So I did that. There was a lot of interesting things. You know, the way we knew we were high was my friend had these colorful coat hangers, you know, clothes hangers, and there were like colorful plastic ones. And there was glow, everything glowed perfectly. So we could tell we were high because we look at it. Yeah. We both experienced the same thing too. So it was like, oh, look at the coat. It was like, oh, yeah, of course. Like are both our reality changing the exact same direction? That's interesting. So that was interesting. It means that it was like affecting the same sensory parts of your body. Exactly. For example, the most interesting example of that was, I saw writing on the walls. I wasn't scared. I was like, dude, there's writing over the fucking, he's like, yeah, we're trying to decipher it. It was just really weird. It was a weird mutual, I was coherent. I wasn't like, whoa, you know. Like you saying it like triggered it with him. Yeah, it was like you probably get an Oculus Rift or something. It was like, I was here mentally the same, but you know, my reality shifted a good five steps that way. It is the two. So it was interesting. So do you recommend it? I would say do a real version. Don't do a shitty one. I could like give you a seizure and kill you. But yeah, I think if you don't have any kind of disorders, look into it. Cause some people have something wrong with their brain where they take a certain drug, it clicks your brain the wrong way, you're fucking psycho or you're, it fucks with your vision or whatever. But I would say if you're a regular person, it's a good experience. Do it at least what it wants, I think. Jack Hadel, advocating drugs on the podcast. Do that. So as far as drugs go, like I do feel like people should experience one psychedelic in their life. You can know the difference. Because when I first did it, I actually had, it's kind of really weird to say, but it's kind of like a, do you remember back in like the Manson family? Oh yeah, yeah. I know it sounds crazy. No, go on over there. I remember where this goes. Do you fucking stab her in 50 times? I don't know. Like the girls like recollect like situations where Manson gave him drugs and he was kind of like their trip partner. Yeah. Would take him through the trip and he was completely sane in this like crazy world.

 SPEAKER_01 [3:47:26.230 --> 3:47:26.247]:

  I was kind of in the same experience where the first time I did it I had a trip partner who followed me who was completely neutral through everything and he was like yeah You're just experiencing stuff and since I was the first time doing it. I was losing my mind By the way, I didn't do LSD. I did mushrooms Yeah, so I did a more safer version of a psychedelic and if I could recommend anything I would recommend doing mushrooms because real pure LSD can like really fuck you up some in some ways It can well it's depends what you take them. Yeah, I've heard

 SPEAKER_07 [3:49:17.487 --> 3:49:20.895]:

 SPEAKER_06 [3:49:20.305 --> 3:49:22.347]:

I didn't know artists was like, you know Yeah, like I always thought I wanted to be an artist But I didn't know there was like a cartoonist and an animator and all these other variations to creating art and I was like No, I want to be a cartoonist and now I'm like, I want to be an animator I wanted to be a comic artist for the longest time and I do recall very distinctly drawing a bunch of Mario cartoons Oh, me too. Where it was like Mario and Luigi and Mario and other variations of Mario like in different colors I used to go to the store go to Walmart and buy like 500 sheet You know those like packs of five sheet things put the paper and have my own stapler in my room And I would just take like 20 sheets of paper after I've drawn in them and I'd staple together I make my comic and I'd stash them in my little white thing and over the years I got I built a huge things of comics and I did it till I was like 15 yeah, and the autism was still growing inside me And then when I hit 16 I was like what the fuck I had like 400 comics and then then I found out about the internet

 SPEAKER_00 [3:53:08.185 --> 3:53:11.189]: 
  I never want to be

 SPEAKER_00 [3:53:15.441 --> 3:53:18.242]: 
  I wanted to be an artist. I'll be an actor though, but I thought.

 SPEAKER_03 [3:53:40.737 --> 3:53:41.445]: 
  Oh, me too.

 SPEAKER_03 [3:53:44.449 --> 3:53:47.149]: 
  Oh absolutely. It's Mario like in different colors. Where are you living? I used to go.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:54:11.837 --> 3:54:12.546]: 
  And then when I hit...

 SPEAKER_01 [3:54:18.081 --> 3:54]: 
  I did this mistake, Chloe. I actually helped with the new dot-zolt.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:54:20.494 --> 3:54:31.311]: 
  Oh yeah, you show it, you like, wait, did you scan them? What was it? No, that was real, that was the original thing for like 10 years ago. I guess they used to- They weren't that bad either. They did look a little like family guy.

 SPEAKER_01 [3:54:23.194 --> 3:54:25.270]: 
  What was it? No, that was real.

 SPEAKER_01 [3:54:31.311 --> 3:54:33.420]: 
  Yeah, that was a beautiful tip, though.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:54:33.015 --> 3:55:18.780]: 
  I also used to take MS Paint and like draw a stickman like walking across and I would have the canvas be like 14,000 in height because there was like no limit in MS Paint And then I would take the little side-scrolling ball after drawing a hundred thousand pictures and just scroll down I was crazy about it. I did Movie maker and I took MS Paint and I would draw actual different frames and put them together I did that later. I did that later with my first like blink 182 music. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I was I was full artistic like you I I made like like 20 episodes of this 5-minute teacher was I don't know why it worked out He's like work. Chris was learning fucking 3d and how to animate really well. I was doing fucking movie maker when you were like 15 I was like, oh look at my blink 182 music video and you were doing like some fucking like 3d animation

 SPEAKER_01 [3:54:47.798 --> 3:54:49.350]: 
  I was cruiser for you though, I did.

 SPEAKER_01 [3:54:55.105 --> 3:54:56.084]:

  Yeah, Chris was learning...

 SPEAKER_00 [3:55:09.786 --> 3:55:12.621]:

 SPEAKER_05 [3:55:18.780 --> 3:55:20.502]: 
  She's in that program that's free, animated.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:55:20.502 --> 3:56:10.502]: 
  with an eight in the middle What the shit you did was sweet I actually, I better what I was doing I was actually when I was also younger too when I was probably 13-14 I also tried I made a bunch of games Like board games? No No, like flash games and stuff Dude I used to do that too, I used to steal new ground games with the Swiftie compiler and change the game I used to, but eventually I started to learn how they actually worked so I started to actually build games that I had Game Maker 8 or whatever I used RPG Maker I was obsessed with RPG Maker I used RPG Maker, it was Game Maker 8 or Pro whatever the fuck it was I used Flash, I also there was a really really really shitty program it was one of the first ones I used, it was called 3D Game Maker I made a game with the tomato character and he fought like big bees and he shot like little fireballs I was really gay, I thought I was so proud of it

 SPEAKER_00 [3:55:31.825 --> 3:55:32.061]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [3:55:32.061 --> 3:55:33.445]:

 SPEAKER_00 [3:55:35.537 --> 3:55:36.195]: 
  Bye you screams,

 SPEAKER_01 [3:55:39.317 --> 3:55:39.992]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_07 [3:55:39.992 --> 3:55:42.186]: 
  I used to, but eventually I still...

 SPEAKER_02 [3:55:49.392 --> 3:55:53.121]: 
  I was obsessed with RPG.

 SPEAKER_01 [3:56:02.993 --> 3:56:03.837]: 
  I don't know

 SPEAKER_07 [3:56:10.502 --> 3:56:15.936]: 
  can play. I don't think I used that one. Click and play. That was like the same thing. It's like MS Paint except you can just make it.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:56:15.936 --> 3:56:23.867]: 
  make like really really terrible games. Stickman just like floating across the screen and going into a house and then it changes scene and stuff. I used to do that all the time.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:56:23.260 --> 3:56:59.946]: 
  Remember I told you about Fercadia? Yeah. Did I ever say I made a bar in Fercadia that people used to come into? Yeah, you created a bar. You actually created a bar? 15 or 14? Was it a sex bar? No. It turned into one of those. It's not a joke, it was a Nintendo bar. And I had to learn to think of Dragon Speak, which was like coding for Fercadia so that, like you'd make it so that when people walk into an object, like text would come up and say what it was. So I had all these like stolen JPEGs involved in Nintendo consoles, all I had was stolen the bar so that people walked into them and would say this is the Nintendo GameCube from 2000, whatever. How many hours do you think you dedicated to that? I can ask my mom like fuck it.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:56:25.133 --> 3:56:25.538]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:56:28.778 --> 3:56:30.533]: 
  You need a bar, you're a creep.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:56:33.182 --> 3:56:34.465]: 
  No, it turned into one.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:56:59.946 --> 3:57]: 
  in like two weeks, like making us do a bar. Two weeks off.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:57:01.482 --> 3:57:07.844]: 
  I'm making that stupid bar. Two weeks off. I was on orbit. You make it for like five years. I never told you about the secret I did in that. So those one day were like,

 SPEAKER_07 [3:57:02.477 --> 3:57:04.435]: 
  Oh, it's on orbit. You make it for like five years. I never told you.

 SPEAKER_05 [3:57:07.844 --> 3:57:23.942]: 
  like 20 people all came in and also had the bar and just roleplayed like like they're at a Nintendo bar and then two of them went off to like the pool and they started like yipping each other but I had a code so you can turn it visible so I was like sitting next to them while they were yipping. I was like watching all the stuff they were doing, it's like puts his dick and they were acting like

 SPEAKER_06 [3:57:23.942 --> 3:57:34.827]: 
  And I was just like hi, I didn't boat like what do you step or would you want to be when you want to grow up when you were a kid? Wouldn't you dream baby stamp what he looked at his window with a chin rolled out his face?

 SPEAKER_01 [3:57:34.827 --> 3:57:47.922]: 
  Well, there's a couple of things. I remember for the longest time I did want to be a police officer, but that was mainly because my parents were both cops. My mom was a sergeant, my dad was a detective, and I spent a lot of time at the police station.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:57:47.922 --> 3:57:54.959]: 
  And I'd see like all the weapons they confiscated from people under big glass You know and then you grew up in

 SPEAKER_06 [3:57:53.946 --> 3:57:58.941]: 
  And then you grew up and spent just as much time at the police station but on the other side of the bars?

 SPEAKER_02 [3:57:58.941 --> 3:58:03.936]: 
  Well, maybe a little bit. I just remember the whole place smelled like coffee and I'd be in there really late.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:58:03.936 --> 3:58:04.999]: 
  tonight and people will come

 SPEAKER_04 [3:58:04.999 --> 3:58:10.450]: 
  coming and going as they pleased. And I just thought it was, I thought it was,

 SPEAKER_02 [3:58:10.450 --> 3:58:39.492]: 
  There's something kind of magical about the whole, when you're a kid you look up at all these guys that they're going out and you find out that being a police officer is a crock of shit. The second one was my mom used to work at a funeral home. And did you hang out there? I did, I hung out there a lot and there was something really nice about the idea of being the final chapter in somebody's life, even though their life is already over.

 SPEAKER_01 [3:58:39.492 --> 3:58:49.920]: 
  person that manages all that and it was a really peaceful environment and people would come in and and you know it was the Midwest so they didn't handle things in the most professional way you know these like

 SPEAKER_02 [3:58:49.482 --> 3:58:49.937]: 
  Let's go.

 SPEAKER_00 [3:58:49.617 --> 3:58:51.389]: 
  It's kind of like, well, I guess we'll do it this way.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:58:51.254 --> 3:58:59.505]: 
  Well, I feel like I've talked about this before, but they used to just bring bodies in and kind of wheel them over to the corner and you could just go up and see them before...

 SPEAKER_01 [3:58:59.505 --> 3:59:00.805]: 
  They were just there, you know.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:59:00.012 --> 3:59:08.365]: 
  less, less, less, less precautions and kind of, just kind of all lucid. The way you think, like they put him in a wagon and he's all over it.

 SPEAKER_03 [3:59:04.990 --> 3:59:06.087]: 
  That's amazing.

 SPEAKER_03 [3:59:06.880 --> 3:59:06.998]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:59:06.998 --> 3:59:10.440]: 
  Because it works, it's a bit worse if we all can't trust each other.

 SPEAKER_06 [3:59:09.141 --> 3:59:09.445]: 
  две part w p h well it will go and so pharmaceutical is

 SPEAKER_01 [3:59:09.445 --> 3:59:11.335]: 
  Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_07 [3:59:10.440 --> 3:59:14.001]: 
  Exactly. It was very human and it was very loose.

 SPEAKER_01 [3:59:13.005 --> 3:59:18.844]: 
  loose where you know Rob just died it's really unfortunate and he's gonna sit over there for a second.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:59:18.642 --> 3:59:19.924]: 
  Do you think that she's the way...

 SPEAKER_06 [3:59:18.827 --> 3:59:20.937]: 
  You think that she's the way you want to go?

 SPEAKER_04 [3:59:20.937 --> 3:59:24.447]: 
  Well, let me move on to number three.

 SPEAKER_01 [3:59:24.447 --> 3:59:38.993]: 
  I for a really long time I wanted to be a priest Because I had two pastors or two priests Christian wise because I grew up really religious I wouldn't say really religious, but I did spend a lot of time in church. Yeah, my priests were great

 SPEAKER_06 [3:59:38.993 --> 3:59:42.435]: 
  guys and you know these to pull me aside they

 SPEAKER_02 [3:59:42.435 --> 3:59:43.853]: 
  You didn't fuck me right now.

 SPEAKER_04 [3:59:43.178 --> 3:59:46.452]: 
  I was gonna say the way you said that. Exactly, no, it's not. Oh, oh.

 SPEAKER_02 [3:59:44.882 --> 4:00:07.714]: 
  Exactly, but no they always treated me like an adult and they're always like they never placated me or Humored me or anything. We always talk to each other religion aside. It really had nothing to do with religion, especially in the Midwest It's all God quote unquote, but truthfully it's more of a sense of its community. That's it afterwards You go out you have a picnic you get ribs you eat corn and shit

 SPEAKER_01 [3:59:59.952 --> 4:00:03.867]: 
  quote but truthfully it's more of a scents of its community that's it

 SPEAKER_06 [4:00:07.005 --> 4:00:14.498]: 
  A lot of the churches I went to literally had like buff you go to see go to church you go downstairs and be fucking coffee donuts everywhere Exactly, and that's

 SPEAKER_02 [4:00:14.498 --> 4:00:27.441]: 
  Like God was an afterthought. He was more just getting everybody together Yeah, definitely. And he would sit up there and talk to you about like simple things like hey If you feel bad about shit, then you know figure it out. It was never like you're going to hey, it was never Catholic

 SPEAKER_06 [4:00:16.152 --> 4:00:16.320]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:00:16.320 --> 4:00:16.844]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:00:27.441 --> 4:00:30.040]: 
  in any way it was all very peaceful.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:00:29.888 --> 4:00:49.024]: 
  I don't know what determines which kind of priests you're gonna get, but my religious experiences are either or. It's either, they're like these really cool like, hey, it'll come to you if it comes to you, and they'll be ready. And then the other one being, yeah, your grandfather, he's Buddhist, he's in hell. Uh, and you've only got how much time left? You see, that was a shitty priest.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:00:41.481 --> 4:00:41.565]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [4:00:47.640 --> 4:00:52.500]: 
  You see those are shitty priests. I mean the first option you gave those were like the guys that I had

 SPEAKER_01 [4:00:52.500 --> 4:00:57.951]: 
  They're like, hey, do what you want to do. But listen, you know, these are, it was more like a relaxing environment where, if you were,

 SPEAKER_02 [4:00:57.951 --> 4:00:59.504]: 
  you were ever feeling bad, you would go to ch-

 SPEAKER_06 [4:00:59.504 --> 4:01:03.587]: 
  I think that's what Sleepy Cabin is for people. Not to be preached at, but to be like...

 SPEAKER_02 [4:01:01.495 --> 4:01:06.861]: 
  Not to be preached at, but to be like comforted, like, oh, everyone feels this way, it's great.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:01:06.692 --> 4:01:42.029]: 
  Yeah, but I think that's exactly I think that's something that I would like to believe we do It's a place that you can go where people don't placate you you can be yourself and and all that kind of stuff Yeah, I had a lot of respect for those guys who are the ones that I grew up with yeah At least yeah, the good one well I'll tell you what I think it's because those you know you only get those two kind of priests because Big a priest kind of attracts those two types of people right sure almost like a cop in a way too It's like you either get the people who really actually want to make the you know right and you get the asshole bully weirdos Who like oh it's a cop I guess how whatever yeah, so you get those two weird polar opposites in a position of power Like for the priest too. Yeah, but if you do it

 SPEAKER_02 [4:01:17.492 --> 4:01:19.939]: 
  Well, the ones that I grew up with, at least, yeah, the good ones.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:01:41.100 --> 4:01:54.550]: 
  Yeah, but if you just like a legitimately nice guy that's looking out for absolutely for everyone definitely then you can't help But look up at him and like really respect him and say you know what I you know, I'd like to make people feel good Yeah, especially if you feel well, right?

 SPEAKER_06 [4:01:52.035 --> 4:02:03.274]: 
  Especially if you feel welcome on a regular basis, you're going into a church or whatnot and you see people in a room looking up to this person literally and this person is also giving advice that is, you know, helping people.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:02:03.004 --> 4:02:04.506]: 
  The whole time the dudes...

 SPEAKER_02 [4:02:04.422 --> 4:02:09.940]: 
  breaking down race and like all these bullshit social barriers and like we're all just a big family and it was really cool.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:02:09.450 --> 4:02:12.775]: 
  was really yeah it's like a little community like it exactly it's

 SPEAKER_01 [4:02:11.627 --> 4:02:11.948]: 
  Check it out.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:02:11.948 --> 4:02:19.677]: 
  I'm actually wondering how many it's like a it's like a career and making people feel comfortable and just enjoying life Yeah, it was nice

 SPEAKER_07 [4:02:17.129 --> 4:02:19.710]: 
  and just enjoying life. It was nice.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:02:19.474 --> 4:03:12.563]: 
  It was really nice and they must have a huge shortage of people who want to be priests now like new people being priests because they must be Last that I mean Chris Janney. I should be underestimated. It's still going strong. I feel yeah, but I don't know I think maybe yeah, maybe like the the the traditional kind of catholicism here maybe yeah a little bit But I mean certainly I know for a fact that all this whole kind of like new age Not new age but this this newer wave of like a Protestant that that's definitely growing because I my mom was positive Catholics so I had both I feel like the Catholics. Oh, you're a mudblood. Yeah, the cat looks like we're like You know the go downstairs. He don't they were actually better in some cases most cases and the pristine guys were a little bit like that But they were like the guys and button ups and go on stage going, you know, Jesus is great guys. He's such a he's my good friend We talked last night. It was great And you know they have the Jesus Rock Band besides the thing that second one is going a lot the whole Jesus kind of rock I think that because it's they're trying to connect to the use more. Yeah going to a place to go

 SPEAKER_05 [4:02:24.672 --> 4:02:25.937]: 
  No, I didn't get it.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:02:29.532 --> 4:02:29.616]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:02:29.616 --> 4:02:29.802]: 
 ...

 SPEAKER_03 [4:02:49.900 --> 4:02:50.254]: 
  Adorei eят

 SPEAKER_01 [4:03:12.563 --> 4:03:16.495]: 
  God look that doesn't affect kids that makes kids

 SPEAKER_02 [4:03:15.314 --> 4:03:21.574]: 
  I tried to go. And it is. It bores people, it fucking, yeah. You know they fall asleep.

  İyi

 SPEAKER_06 [4:03:20.005 --> 4:03:27.869]: 
  Yeah, all of them fall asleep. Now they've got the new age Christian memes that they've been putting out and stuff like that. Yeah, but unfortunately. Trying to get the youth hook.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:03:25.135 --> 4:03:33.437]: 
  It's yeah, but unfortunately the youth hook if you could do it right though It is a roundabout way of getting human beings together, and that's

 SPEAKER_04 [4:03:26.991 --> 4:03:27.784]: 
  the youth hook

 SPEAKER_01 [4:03:33.437 --> 4:03:36.930]: 
  it has nothing to do with anything else.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:03:35.884 --> 4:03:36.492]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:03:36.492 --> 4:03:40.491]: 
  And you couldn't do that in any other four like I couldn't just like put an open call

 SPEAKER_01 [4:03:40.491 --> 4:03:52.945]: 
  out to fucking all the philadelphiaans say hey let's just go talk and be humans you like there's like that little keystone up top this thing oh yeah it's religious so you come in you know it's everybody at the one thing yeah exactly which is hard to do

 SPEAKER_06 [4:03:49.317 --> 4:04:02.631]: 
  You know, it, it, it, you let everybody do one thing. Yeah, exactly. Which is hard to do. My church experiences will always be boring shit. People stand up there and talk, and then everyone's like, oh man, unison, you're just like. Yeah, I'll tell you this much. It's like an hour.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:03:51.949 --> 4:03:52.979]: 
  Which is hard to do

 SPEAKER_02 [4:04:00.741 --> 4:04:08.993]: 
  Y'all tell me this much. It's like an argument. If you got a preacher up there and he's not boring kids, then he's doing a good job. Because he never fucking bored me.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:04:07.407 --> 4:04:07.559]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:04:08.993 --> 4:04:49.611]: 
  He was just a legitimately good guy. No, this guy is just like, he's up there and he's just like, and then God carried us out here. Oh man, it's just like, oh, I'm hungry. I think it's like, with any job, if you're enthusiastic, if you want, if people see that you wouldn't be there, they'll want to be there. You're gonna do it, you'll never guess what fucking Jesus did. People are gonna go, whoa, what's going on? Well, not necessarily. I guess he called out of a hole or something. Not necessarily. You know those like, when you're older and those people come in to like, they're very enthusiastic about their job to like sell like, drugs in school. Like, you know, like don't do drugs. Oh, those anti-drug guys? Those anti-anything guys? Well, there's being cheesy and there's being enthusiastic.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:04:30.002 --> 4:04:30.019]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [4:04:30.019 --> 4:04:30.829]: 
  Well, not necessarily.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:04:33.681 --> 4:04:34.440]: 
  Not necessarily.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:04:34.440 --> 4:04:35.385]: 
  You know those like

 SPEAKER_02 [4:04:49.611 --> 4:05:00.006]: 
  Oh, and let me clarify. No part of my upbringing or life, early age, had anything to do with art or voice acting or anything. Just get a pillow do it. What I was thinking about was...

 SPEAKER_01 [4:04:57.846 --> 4:04:58.994]: 
  Just go to pillow dude.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:05:00.006 --> 4:05:09.237]: 
  was a lot of it revolved around personality and personality fell into art and animation because it's a way that you could do things like that. Like, you know.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:05:08.781 --> 4:05:16.442]: 
  You know, a good preacher is all personality. A good, I wouldn't say mortician, never mind, because he didn't really have to talk to anybody, but...

 SPEAKER_01 [4:05:16.442 --> 4:05:30.904]: 
  good police officer to sub degree? Sure, yeah, it's all about dealing with human beings in a very positive manner and constructive too. Yeah, constructive and just just working with other members of society and in a lot of ways.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:05:17.978 --> 4:05:18.450]: 
  Sure, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:05:29.234 --> 4:05:44.387]: 
  and in a lot of ways, yeah, we do that through digital media. Definitely. In a lot of ways, when you put out a cartoon, you're essentially preaching to people. Yeah. And you're, with your comedy or whatever, you know, you're not preaching religiously, but you're still talking to a wide audience.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:05:33.284 --> 4:05:33.891]: 
  Definitely.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:05:33.891 --> 4:05:33.992]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_06 [4:05:37.975 --> 4:05:38.127]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_06 [4:05:43.915 --> 4:06:11.489]: 
  You're still evoking it. Your people feel different and they're different after you've interacted with them I think it's what it's about. If you're a cop, if you're a bad cop, you walk and go, ah, you've sped or whatever You're not gonna get anything done But if you walk up and you if after the interaction you both walk away feeling better about it You fix something. I think that's it. Even if making someone laugh It's not like fixing fucking world hunger, but you're still making someone laugh You're still evoking emotion. You're still changing something a little bit and you're still interacting a little bit too

 SPEAKER_01 [4:06:11.489 --> 4:06:15.944]: 
  So maybe everybody in this room isn't necessarily an animator or a voice actor, put the

 SPEAKER_02 [4:06:15.944 --> 4:06:20.500]: 
  they're a personality that's trying to get out in a way that just kind of...

 SPEAKER_01 [4:06:20.500 --> 4:06:22.727]: 
  Connect with human beings.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:06:22.626 --> 4:06:44.834]: 
  No, and I think that's definitely exemplified with someone like you know like a Pewdiepie or markiplier where clearly it doesn't matter What they do they shooting on the toilet or sticking pencils up their nose But it's the they're they happen to be playing a video game But it is I think people are watching for them right and they're connecting in like almost a religious sense I mean numbers wise it's bigger than some religious

 SPEAKER_02 [4:06:22.677 --> 4:06:24.938]: 
  No, and I think that... And you don't have to pigeon him.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:06:23.993 --> 4:06:25.934]: 
  you don't have a pigeon in yourr you definitely don't have a pigeon in your view

 SPEAKER_04 [4:06:31.215 --> 4:06:31.739]: 
  And become

 SPEAKER_01 [4:06:44.783 --> 4:06:49.002]: 
  Well look, do you want to help people, make people laugh, save people? There's, it's all...

 SPEAKER_06 [4:06:49.002 --> 4:07:29.940]: 
  I think I think you said right though. You have to you don't have to be here So I think I think a lot of people go I have to be this and if they if they if they I want to be a banker It's not a banker. They they're failures. There's a chance is our you can fit into a lot of different categories with what with the way You are by being human a big human there you go So if you don't work as a banker, hey, maybe you maybe you'd be a really good fucking I don't know script or maybe you'd be a really good shoe salesman. There's a lot of different things you can do Don't don't that's not to say anything's better than anything else No, no, it's just whatever fits you the best or whatever you're gonna excel at the best or whatever You're gonna make society better doing the best. I like that I really fucking really good. I like how the it's important to become human yet some of us when we were children money is a

 SPEAKER_01 [4:07:16.019 --> 4:07:17.132]: 
  Don't isolate yourself.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:07:28.658 --> 4:07:42.782]: 
  Money is a byproduct of doing what you feel you're good at and doing what you want to do. If money is your first... If money is your chapter one, then you've already fucked up. If you're looking to make money, then you're already failing.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:07:34.497 --> 4:07:34.564]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [4:07:38.749 --> 4:07:39.222]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:07:42.614 --> 4:10:25.980]: 
  Because it'll never be enough. There's no cap on when you're like, oh, yeah, now I'm good. Alright, Ninja Tei Tei Tasty, Ninja J, Ninja J Tasty. Jesus Christ, dude. What piece of media has actually made you tear up or cry? Fucking Titanic. Really? Really. Chris is so serious, too. It's fine. That was early. No, okay, the most recent thing. You cried right when the credits rolled at the beginning, though, so I don't know if that counts. You actually have to let it in. Oh, it did. I tried to Titanic when I first came out, so I was very young, but recently... You don't have to, you don't have to sure-coat it. We're all been here, we all. No, I'm trying to think of the most recent thing that made me actually... Okay, a letter to Zachary, definitely. I bawled like a bitch. You mean, Deer Zachary? Yeah, a letter to Zachary, Deer Zachary. Remember, there's a letter from a song on our... I feel like... Sorry, I don't want to interrupt, but I feel like if something actually invokes enough emotion to make you actually, like, care, then it's done a good job. Because I've seen a lot of movies, I've seen a lot... I've even played a lot of games. I've, like, watched a lot of stuff that has made me, like, almost tear up. But it's because of the music choice, it's because of the dialogue and how you feel about the characters. I can't really pinpoint the last time I really, like, broke down and cried, but I do say... Also, can I ask you, is that real crime? Definitely choking. Got that little thing in your throat, you're like, ooh, I feel that. Definitely movies. Actually, the first time, this is gonna sound really gay. But the first time I actually, like, kind of choked was... On a date? Yes, on a dick and made me gag and cry was artificial intelligence, that movie. That movie made me really sad. That movie made me fucking sad when I first saw it. Yeah, that movie made me really sad. Yeah, no, yeah, where it's like this little kid, he's just been wanting his mom the whole time, literally dying, and he's brought back to life, and the only wish he gets, a million years in the future, is to spend one day with his mom, that whole time. I was just, like, I was fucking bawling. I was young, but that was really sad. The Fox in the Hound made me fucking sad. That's really sad. That is fucking hilarious. Where the red fern grows made me fucking cry in school. I had to hide my face. I had to hide my face because I was fucking, my eyes were so red, I had my books over my head because I was so embarrassed, but man, that movie is sad. And all the jocks would call you a pussy, too. Well, I was in, like, seventh grade, but... Shawshank Redemption 2. There's jocks in the seventh grade. Well, actually... I don't know if I get sad at Shawshank Redemption. At the end when he's on the beach, come on. I actually... It's a bittersweet, right? The thing for me is probably... The jocks. For me, it was least emotional. Just because it's like, I don't want to hug more. What about when dude were on himself? I love it like that. Yeah, yeah, it was like that. No, but it's really happy sad. Yeah, but it's not sad. It's bitter sweet. It's bitter sweet. It's like happy, but it's sad. Anybody in the comment section, talk about the thing that made you emotional and cry nearly closely. Don't get it right, come on.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:08:00.434 --> 4:08:02.492]: 
  Chris is so serious too

 SPEAKER_03 [4:08:02.492 --> 4:08:03.505]: 
  That was early.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:08:08.669 --> 4:08:09.917]: 
  It counts. You actually have to let it in.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:08:09.917 --> 4:08:10.052]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:08:10.845 --> 4:08:11.639]:

  We don't have to.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:08:25.122 --> 4:08:27.450]: 
  Remember, here's exactly the letter from the sonar.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:08:27.450 --> 4:08:27.737]:

 SPEAKER_03 [4:09:35.912 --> 4:09:40.941]: 
  I was young but that was really sad. That was actually the sound made me fucking sad. That's really sad.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:09:40.941 --> 4:09:41.346]: 
  That is what I'm talking about.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:09:44.839 --> 4:09:45.312]: 
  I had a heart attack.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:09:44.991 --> 4:09:47.168]: 
  That's where the red shirt goes, yeah.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:09:45.312 --> 4:09:45.497]:

 SPEAKER_02 [4:09:59.352 --> 4:10:01.630]: 
  There's jocks in the seventh grade well actually

  Anybody...

 SPEAKER_02 [4:10:24.074 --> 4:10:31.212]: 
  Nearly closely. Don't get the right comments. Is the question like if it made you legitimately sad? Yeah, what piece of media is sad? I just think it broke the book.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:10:28.005 --> 4:10:29.474]: 
  Yeah, what piece of media?

 SPEAKER_06 [4:10:29.474 --> 4:10:37.725]:

 SPEAKER_02 [4:10:35.970 --> 4:10:46.433]: 
  I feel like that's a really good job. I'm a bitch too. I catch... Iron Giant. Iron Giant actually made me... Yeah, I catch a bunch of songs that like... Oh, songs knew what it means.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:10:39.548 --> 4:10:40.949]: 
  Iron Giant.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:10:44.526 --> 4:10:49.454]: 
  Oh, songs do it for me. Songs do it for me. No songs do it for me.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:10:48.407 --> 4:10:48.576]: 
  for me.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:10:48.576 --> 4:10:54.938]: 
  And you look over your shoulder to make sure nobody's standing there and then you can just start like leaking out. Rub it, just rub your eyes.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:10:52.120 --> 4:11:24.992]: 
  like When it's just so perfect and so beautiful you just say Choke up for real was uh They did the new Cosmo series in the last episode they played the pale blue diet thing But they played use call say it's clip and I was like, oh It fucking that's not that's not that choked up. I was like man There's actually such a fucking beautiful piece and they use like they updated it They had like the kind of zoom this is a long pan out up from earth. Yeah, that's smart smart That was the last thing space stuff like that gay space stuff always always does it for me?

 SPEAKER_00 [4:10:57.284 --> 4:10:58.448]: 
  I'll tweet it, I'll tweet it, let's see what we can do.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:11:24.992 --> 4:11:27.439]: 
  how it's a good word stuff. In fact,

 SPEAKER_02 [4:11:26.832 --> 4:11:32.130]: 
  In my whole life, I will never hear somebody say, Gaze Face Cup. I'm really going to go, eh, eh, eh. Mix me, cry.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:11:29.498 --> 4:11:30.949]: 
  I'm gonna go and mix it up.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:11:30.949 --> 4:12:01.949]: 
  I cry. No, but. That whole phrase. They did this, the Curiosity River took this big panoramic shot of Mars and sky and it's just, you look around the, the, the, the 360. Yeah, it's so both of them. It is, it is absolutely bellen. Yeah. And you can see this beautiful sky and it's just, to imagine what it would be like to be there, it's the dead silence. Yeah. In the chaos of Earth, the screaming and politics of war, it's like, Mars, it's totally, it isn't the quiet and peaceful. That, that thought always got to me.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:11:42.002 --> 4:11:44.534]: 
  D's

 SPEAKER_07 [4:12:01.949 --> 4:12:03.653]: 
  It's well known, but what do you think? That's very true.

 SPEAKER_05 [4:12:02.995 --> 4:12:06.505]: 
  The curiosity rover like plays happy birthday to itself every day

 SPEAKER_06 [4:12:06.505 --> 4:12:09.441]: 
  year.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:12:09.441 --> 4:12:18.300]: 
  Because they're on it by itself and a little jingle have it. You know, you're not just fucking eating Earth's work. Yeah, it's like just... He's just there. It was dead, dead silent.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:12:13.491 --> 4:12:14.099]: 
  Yeah, it's a good one.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:12:18.250 --> 4:12:28.004]: 
  Yeah, the last media thing I'll share is there's like, like everyone has their song that they can't hear because it like invokes emotion. Yeah. And for me...

 SPEAKER_01 [4:12:27.447 --> 4:12:32.172]: 
  We need that they can't hear like something you won't listen to again. Just because it's kind of a disconcerting.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:12:30.788 --> 4:12:49.553]: 
  I won't listen to it unless I'm in a really upset mood and it's again like it all has to stem from my childhood And it's like like Anytime I listen to this song was when I was going through a lot of shit. I have a couple songs like that Yeah, and the the raindrops are falling on my head as the song it is

 SPEAKER_04 [4:12:44.322 --> 4:12:44.879]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:12:48.743 --> 4:12:53.974]: 
  That's like, that's like, that's kind of had raindrops. Yeah, but that that's kind of like happy though.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:12:51.342 --> 4:13:14.714]: 
  Yeah, but that's kind of like happy though. Exactly, because I listened to it and I was really sad and it made me happy. So when I'm really upset and like sad, I'll listen to that song and it'll make me really happy. Maybe too happy, maybe like emotional happy, but that's a really good song. I really like that. That's so simple, that song too. It's a really good song. It's amazing. There's a song called Haunted by Paul.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:13:06.293 --> 4:13:07.373]: 
  I really like that.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:13:09.651 --> 4:13:11.204]: 
  That's amazing. Such a beautiful song.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:13:14.714 --> 4:13:24.113]: 
  Like Edgar Allen Poe. And the first time I heard that, I choked up really hard. I was like, what's going on here? And to this day, it's still one of my favorite songs. What song's John Boots is?

 SPEAKER_03 [4:13:19.118 --> 4:13:20.991]: 
  I was like, what's going on here?

 SPEAKER_06 [4:13:20.991 --> 4:13]: 
  To this day it's still one of my favorite songs. If not my favorite song when songs draw a motion It's yeah, not a surf is a song called blonde on blonde and that one always gets me I was in New York. Can I be crucified here? What landslide by fluid back I don't choke up like that's a sad but I get to be sad makes me fucking brings my mood down That's the course go. What's the song they use in Chris like?

 SPEAKER_00 [4:13:30.137 --> 4:13:31.217]: 
  I can listen to it while I was...

 SPEAKER_03 [4:13:35.824 --> 4:13:36.364]: 
  What's wrong?

 SPEAKER_01 [4:13:36.128 --> 4:13:36.212]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:13:36.364 --> 4:13:37.815]: 
  You look like it's gray!

 SPEAKER_01 [4:13:37.815 --> 4:13:39.267]: 
  It's just a game of sorts.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:13:47.637 --> 4:13:48.936]: 
  I don't wanna miss it.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:13:47.991 --> 4:13:52.733]: 
  I don't wanna miss a thing! I don't miss a thing! Yeah, I don't wanna miss a thing.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:13:48.936 --> 4:13:49.442]: 
  It's a bit...

 SPEAKER_00 [4:13:49.004 --> 4:13:49.814]: 
  It's a thing.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:13:51.923 --> 4:13:55.500]: 
  What the bodies, what the bodies?

 SPEAKER_01 [4:13:58.943 --> 4:14:02.200]: 
  me shed a little tear. I always I always put my head in the window pane.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:14:01.812 --> 4:14:34.937]: 
  Most of the time I don't cry or get upset during a movie. It does happen, but most of the time I feel like I save it up, and then something stupid will happen, like a commercial will come on. And I'm like, oh, fuck! The Windex, you're like, oh, fucking Windex! It really is. Though I will say the last time I remember getting choked up at a movie was Guardians of the Galaxy at the beginning when he's with his mom. Oh, dude, that was tough. That scene just with his mom, and she gives him the presents. And then he, like, oh, yeah, he, like, won't talk to her. Dude, I just laid over that.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:14:10.367 --> 4:14:16.459]: 
  He was like, oh! And then all of a sudden I'm just like, oh fuck! No, Windex! He's like, oh! It's like tipping the point.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:14:25.049 --> 4:14:26.804]: 
  Oh dude that was that scene

 SPEAKER_02 [4:14:33.402 --> 4:14:36.675]: 
  Dude, I just lazed over that scene. That's what the pussy snagged.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:14:34.937 --> 4:14:38.211]: 
  scene there's a pussy like why did that bother you

 SPEAKER_02 [4:14:37.452 --> 4:14:47.948]: 
  Bobby so much it be maybe because I hadn't been I haven't no no wait did you watch the movie first and then go back and the second time you watch the you got choked say it did you know it's no I

 SPEAKER_06 [4:14:46.024 --> 4:14:50.496]: 
  He's saying things that you want to do. No, I just saw a kid in his mom's room.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:14:50.496 --> 4:14:56.217]: 
  You didn't even, you had no connection or cared about these people yet, so why would it even bother you at that point? Because you know what, it caught me off guard.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:14:56.217 --> 4:15:28.448]: 
  I didn't expect a movie to start that way. You don't expect the movie to start. I'll say this too I feel like a lot of this stuff is not even the material It's like how you're feeling anyways, it just it pinpoints it You're like it's nears it down like if you hear a song and it's like talking about like something that happened your life recently And that's what it hits you or like a movie when it hits something It usually hits the thing you try to forget about and that's why it brings something out of you Oh, yeah, it's all your emotion What fucking pit you know everything you hear and see all of a sudden it really is going on relates to that absolutely

 SPEAKER_03 [4:14:59.997 --> 4:15:01.077]: 
  I'll say this too.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:15:17.935 --> 4:15:18.492]: 
  Oh, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:15:18.492 --> 4:15:22.525]: 
  It's all your emotion. Is the white fucking pig going to look at that?

 SPEAKER_02 [4:15:27.300 --> 4:15:35.451]: 
  Oh my god. And, truthfully, when somebody's having a bad day, I always hear them say, like, you know, I'm done with this shit. I'm gonna go watch a movie. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's like a mind-

 SPEAKER_01 [4:15:33.764 --> 4:15:37.881]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's like a mind-feel. It's like, yeah, pick a good boost.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:15:35.451 --> 4:15:54.942]: 
  I thought the end of it was like sadder than the beginning when he opens the set. Oh yeah, that's sad. That's good. So the beginning made that sad, but yeah when I first started I was like It's kind of cliche. I basically just blew my load 10 seconds into the movie and then by the end of it I was already sausage. You know what the saddest shit ever is?

 SPEAKER_02 [4:15:40.750 --> 4:15:41.442]: 
  Oh, yeah.

 SPEAKER_05 [4:15:41.442 --> 4:15:42.454]: 
  That's good.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:15:46.200 --> 4:15:47.652]: 
  That's kind of cliche.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:15:51.600 --> 4:15:52.495]: 
  I was already

 SPEAKER_01 [4:15:52.495 --> 4:15:55.448]: 
  No tears left. No tears left. You know the saddest shit ever is fucking...

 SPEAKER_02 [4:15:54.385 --> 4:15:58.637]: 
  You felt victim to focus groups and everything that made people sad.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:15:56.511 --> 4:16:08.729]: 
  and everything that made people sad. The saddest shit ever is fucking Frodo and Sam on the side of the mountain dying. Just the saddest shit ever. Or fucking Harry Potter hugging Hagrid at the end of Harry Potter 2. Oh my god, Chad! What's that?

 SPEAKER_01 [4:15:56.528 --> 4:15]: 
  take care everybody.

 SPEAKER_05 [4:16:02.063 --> 4:16:03.632]: 
  Just a saddest shit ever.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:16:06.906 --> 4:16:15.546]: 
  Oh my god, what's that? It's said it's Alex Murphy walking through his house to fight his family moved away. They thought he was dead Chris. No that's funny. He punches the screen Chris!

 SPEAKER_06 [4:16:13.268 --> 4:16:14.500]:

 SPEAKER_00 [4:16:14.500 --> 4:16:16.744]: 
  He's freaked us out.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:16:16.744 --> 4:16:23.444]: 
  I don't know what Sam were like. You knew they were gonna live anyways. I mean that this... No you didn't! He goes finger bit off!

 SPEAKER_06 [4:16:23.444 --> 4:16]: 
  I read the books so I didn't know I really didn't know you really

 SPEAKER_02 [4:16 --> 4:16:34.497]: 
  Oh, you know what? I still get choked up every time that the T800 drops himself into the lava at the end. The T2? Of T2.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:16:32.826 --> 4:16:32.995]: 
  the end.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:16:32.995 --> 4:16:34.547]: 
  T2? Of T2.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:16:33.619 --> 4:16:33.940]:

 SPEAKER_06 [4:16:33.990 --> 4:16:34.581]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:16:34.125 --> 4:16:36.218]: 
  We just a thumbs up and he goes to the levels

 SPEAKER_06 [4:16:35.442 --> 4:16:35.948]: 
  Those are the ones.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:16:35.712 --> 4:16:41.280]: 
  I have to watch it by myself though. I'm just watching a movie.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:16:37.534 --> 4:16:38.952]:

 SPEAKER_07 [4:16:39.053 --> 4:16:39.576]: 
  모비엘이

 SPEAKER_07 [4:16:40.572 --> 4:16:44.588]: 
  Cause he does a little thump and it's completely pointless It's completely pointless dad

 SPEAKER_06 [4:16:43.440 --> 4:16:52.587]: 
  So we were watching it at the house the other day and when that scene came up Stanford was like oh I gotta go check my messages and went into the office so I didn't know that that was actually what was happening.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:16:52.418 --> 4:16:57.497]: 
  That was crying. I was just crying. I was just crying. He's alone on the couch. Cookie's forehead.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:16:57.497 --> 4:16:58.004]:

 SPEAKER_00 [4:16:58.004 --> 4:17:00.501]: 
  So much! You said you were coming back!

 SPEAKER_04 [4:17:00.501 --> 4:17:04.450]: 
  I was a little faggot, like breakup songs worked on me when I went through a breakup. No.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:17:00.704 --> 4:17:01.007]: 
  아주!

 SPEAKER_06 [4:17:03.589 --> 4:17:12.938]: 
  No, it's funny. Whenever you're going through, you'll see it everywhere. So many breakups out there. Either if you're in love or if you're breaking up or if somebody died or anything, you'll see it everywhere.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:17:12.314 --> 4:17:12.347]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [4:17:12.938 --> 4:17:18.929]: 
  Breakup songs like it really sucks that I broke up or break up no one's like heartbreak ones. Fuck you

 SPEAKER_07 [4:17:18.929 --> 4:17:21.004]: 
  I'm glad that we broke up. Oh no, see, that was like...

 SPEAKER_02 [4:17:20.211 --> 4:17:20.329]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:17:21.004 --> 4:17:55.446]: 
  Like a month after I listen to those ones I was like, I don't think it matters because it's like if you hear a happy love song The whole time all I'm like if let's say you go through a bad breakup Hypothetically and you hear a song about love the whole time. I'm just like you fucking I put and then when you hear a song about how Love's shit. You're just like I don't think I mean I don't think it was like you'll fuck you I don't even got any satisfaction with but the ones that are bittersweet the way where it's like, you know Do I think those little ones that you guys are putting on all the wrong songs after a breakup? What's that one song you put on like bomb-bomb battlefield

 SPEAKER_05 [4:17:36.411 --> 4:17:36.428]:

 SPEAKER_00 [4:17:36.428 --> 4:17:38.267]:

  Yep.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:17:48.679 --> 4:17:49.371]:

 SPEAKER_03 [4:17:55.446 --> 4:17:57.437]:

 SPEAKER_00 [4:18:13.806 --> 4:18:13.992]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_04 [4:18:13.992 --> 4:18:16.320]:

  Yes.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:19:08.093 --> 4:19:21.441]: 
  All you, all yours. I would capture, I would steal Chris's ability to learn different things very quickly. Yeah, yeah Chris, I would definitely steal that thing. Thanks. I would get a sliver of that. I would get a sliver of that.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:19:08.937 --> 4:19:09.443]: 
  All yours.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:19:14.826 --> 4:19:15.450]:

  you

 SPEAKER_07 [4:19:17.037 --> 4:19:17.661]: 
  Thanks.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:19:19.214 --> 4:19:25.947]: 
  I never like when I first moved in with Chris I like I'd never think of like

 SPEAKER_05 [4:19:25.626 --> 4:19:29.153]: 
  Like just being able to like learn how to do how to like

 SPEAKER_07 [4:19:29.153 --> 4:19:32.882]: 
  make a game or something like now he's but that like he just does it so then I was like

 SPEAKER_05 [4:19:32.882 --> 4:19:36.004]: 
  Wait, I'll just do it. He's like, why don't you just like learn how to do it?

 SPEAKER_07 [4:19:36.004 --> 4:19:39.936]: 
  I thought you have to go to college to do like all this shit. I'm like

 SPEAKER_01 [4:19:39.936 --> 4:19:44.425]: 
  The best college ever yeah, I learned every close the way this course the best is

 SPEAKER_06 [4:19:44.425 --> 4:20:32.907]: 
  This group hands out. I'll say that safely and call you never you're self-taught completely You are you just learned everything just for like looking so much for me to stuff out I think dude, I've seen I've seen people with degrees in college Please who are fucking garbage? I'm not good myself But you know it if you want to learn something you're gonna learn it anyways If you go to college with the expectation you just gonna walk you just gonna go through classes and get better But you have no drive to get better You're not gonna get better if I just steal one treat from one of you guys Well, we've said a bunch of other people so I feel like it's good to spread things around either take Zach's general intelligence or Stamper's ability to I don't know what the word is. Can I get a half and half? It's not go through What's that? Can I get like half and half of everybody just to try it out? Yeah, everyone's just peeing with a cup and corduroy drink it

 SPEAKER_00 [4:20:24.807 --> 4:20:25.499]: 
  Can I get half of that?

 SPEAKER_04 [4:20:25.499 --> 4:20:27.405]: 
  half and half. Let's not go through.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:20:28.097 --> 4:20:28.215]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_05 [4:20:30.932 --> 4:20:30.949]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_06 [4:20:33.818 --> 4:21:04.446]: 
  I will absorb all your answers. You're not gonna get any of them, you're still just... Well, no, I mean, yeah, so it's either Zex, Zex, just general knowledge of just so many different things. Okay, keep it. I know that's something I could work on, but like, I feel like you retain stuff really well. Thank you, Ben. And despite the fact that I do read a bit, I don't feel like I retain very much. That was one of the biggest problems I had in college was that I had to memorize scripts all the time, and I have friends today that can like, just rip out lines from plays we did together. I cannot remember one word. I cannot. I mean, in nature, you're retaining things that are...

 SPEAKER_00 [4:20:34.493 --> 4:20:35.219]: 
  You're not gonna get it.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:21:03.450 --> 4:21:06.184]: 
  retaining things that are important to you

 SPEAKER_06 [4:21:05.610 --> 4:21:21.794]: 
  Yeah, I'll tell you what if I read something I didn't care about it We just all go like the fact that I'm enthusiastic about it is why I know about it There you go. You know what I mean? Because I went through school. I'll say this like I Was terrible that I failed two years in a row. I passed high school same here past high school stuff, but I can't do that

 SPEAKER_01 [4:21:20.984 --> 4:21:23.447]: 
  I can't do that. But, for example,

 SPEAKER_06 [4:21:23.447 --> 4:21:33.994]: 
  When I went to astronomy class, I went in there, didn't study once because I only knew everything. I got A's, all my tests. But again, in other subjects, I studied hard, fucking did poorly.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:21:33.994 --> 4:21:39.377]: 
  So it just it they have a hard time gay gauging interest it's interesting

 SPEAKER_06 [4:21:38.280 --> 4:21:42.010]: 
  It's interesting. If you're interested, you can remember anything.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:21:41.655 --> 4:21:42.499]: 
  There's a lot of people that

 SPEAKER_02 [4:21:41.807 --> 4:21:50.937]: 
  There's a lot of people that are very interested in math so I love the math when I was in school I do too Why, why shove people through that funnel if they don't give two fucks

 SPEAKER_04 [4:21:44.676 --> 4:21:46.802]: 
  I love the mats when I was in school. How do you do?

 SPEAKER_01 [4:21:50.937 --> 4:21:51.645]: 
  about mass.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:21:51.494 --> 4:22:05.500]: 
  The school system is baffling to me. It literally just kind of came up like by kind of improvising. So I guess we just I guess we just, I guess we just put them in a retell. What stuff? But but it's the point of school is the scattershot because we're very very fortunate. So school is lost.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:22:05.500 --> 4:22:08.504]: 
  Yeah, but after 12 years you'd think that there was... You would have a better idea.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:22:07.491 --> 4:22:11.946]: 
  You would have a better idea of what your strength was or what you were interested in.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:22:07.997 --> 4:22:17.498]: 
  have a better idea of what you're straight, what you were interested in. That's the focus school though. Everybody up top should understand what you're excelling at and what you... And they should focus on that.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:22:11.946 --> 4:22:12.182]: 
  That's about it.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:22:12.182 --> 4:22:12.402]: 
 謝謝

 SPEAKER_07 [4:22:17.211 --> 4:22:24.450]: 
  simply don't understand they do that in England though as far as I know you only take three subjects in your last like four years or something what they do here

 SPEAKER_06 [4:22:23.860 --> 4:22:48.126]: 
  What they do here is the point of like society is like everyone has to work and what has to do something So you put kids because average people don't know what they want to do most people they're 18 or 20 or 30 Don't know what they want to do we're very fortunate But a lot most people don't know what to do And so the idea of school is to show everybody at the fucking throw everybody at them for like 12 years and hopefully they go Yes, science wasn't that bad I get art. Okay a little bit of that that defense is like

 SPEAKER_04 [4:22:24.450 --> 4:22:25.817]: 
  I'm going to real detail.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:22:46.557 --> 4:22:47.535]: 
  We're in a little bit of the...

 SPEAKER_01 [4:22:47.535 --> 4:22:49.645]: 
  Hey, I still don't know what I want to do.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:22:49.645 --> 4:22:52.446]: 
  A little bit of that defense is like you won't know until you try it.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:22:52.446 --> 4:22:59.449]: 
  Like in some ways, you know, I agree that but at some point if you're doing a horribly horribly horribly at something I'm never gonna have to

 SPEAKER_02 [4:22:59.449 --> 4:23]: 
  not showing any interest in your bombing hard. And your bombing hard, exactly. It's depressing. I was in pre-algebra for three years and then dropped out of high school. Not because of pre-algebra, but everything else. It was just like, I'm not a math person. I don't understand.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:23:00.782 --> 4:23:01.440]: 
  and you were bonkers.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:23:01.440 --> 4:23:02.622]: 
  It's coming hard.

 SPEAKER_05 [4:23 --> 4:23:16.493]: 
  I think most of the things I learned actually were completely useless to

 SPEAKER_06 [4:23:16.493 --> 4:24:34.017]: 
  I forgot 95% everything by the way, Rick took about what you said everything I know now Like everything they don't retain all the knowledge I have and stuff not all of it But the stuff I know about is stuff I learned about actively out of interest I don't remember anything from high school anything. It's all gone and I would say on that same note Chris I bet it's the same thing like as far as things that you do remember So you saying everything from school you don't really care about but everything you do care about and no No, I bet you learned after school or dirt school separately. Okay. It looks listen this yeah Dureings that you you were sitting at home doing exactly exactly this way I was forced to learn Irish language none of it's left in my brain mathematics none of it's left in my brain Geography is like good, but I don't need to know about tectonic plates or any of that shit. So that's all gone History I like learning about that, but that was gone when I was in high school because I just didn't get that as a subject Biology was good. What else was there? Religion with the learn about religion at the same time. I do think it's good to have it to have an educated public Right, it's good for it's good for Americans to point where Iraq is on the map or whatever, you know stuff like that I get but there's a difference between that fucking forcing kids to learn Trigolometry when they're fucking you know when they're super interesting I don't know any art history is boring. No fuck. It was all shitty pictures except for the renaissance

 SPEAKER_00 [4:23:43.476 --> 4:23:43.881]: 
  Separate.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:23:44.775 --> 4:23:44.995]: 
  See you.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:23:46.750 --> 4:23:47.897]: 
  Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:23:47.003 --> 4:23:47.442]: 
  You're going to get it.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:24:09.565 --> 4:24:11.067]: 
  religion with the learn about religion

 SPEAKER_07 [4:24:10.004 --> 4:24:10.493]: 
  with the learnab-

 SPEAKER_01 [4:24:10.695 --> 4:24:11.134]: 
  religion.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:24:27.098 --> 4:24:28.448]: 
 <|hi|><|ru|> biking variations not for us

 SPEAKER_00 [4:24:28.448 --> 4:24:28.735]: 
  I don't know.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:24:33.949 --> 4:24:46.977]: 
  You know, but if that's your thing, like, my cousin Aaron is a god in math. And you go up to one of his speeches and he'll just sit and say, here's my hypothesis here, and he will leave you in the first 10 seconds. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:24:34.017 --> 4:24:36.261]: 
  You know, but if that's your saying like...

 SPEAKER_02 [4:24:46.690 --> 4:24:48.006]: 
  You won't understand anything.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:24:48.006 --> 4:24:54.030]: 
  he's saying, you know, granted he's part of my family and all that, but that's what he excelled at, that's what he cared about. At the same time,

 SPEAKER_02 [4:24:54.030 --> 4:24:57.439]: 
  He probably bombed homeic art, everything in between.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:24:57.439 --> 4:25:01.439]: 
  because he was so focused on math. It's so saturated by earth.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:25:01.439 --> 4:25:08.999]: 
  and then maybe- But let them be good at that. Exactly. Yeah, absolutely. Like, why grade every human being on their level of

 SPEAKER_06 [4:25:04.054 --> 4:25:04.645]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:25:08.999 --> 4:25:12.104]: 
  understanding on every topic on the planet.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:25:12.104 --> 4:25:15.445]: 
  If you're amazing at math, you're more valuable than if you're kind of good at everything. Sure.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:25:15.225 --> 4:25:20.102]: 
  Sure. And then you drop all the other subjects out and say, Dude, you're going for a man.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:25:19.022 --> 4:25:37.079]: 
  I hate in math. I would I fucking hated math. I still have to read numbers backwards I don't understand I know basic math and counting on my fingers and I'm still at that skill level I never learned long division. No, okay, so you don't need to know that kind of shit

 SPEAKER_02 [4:25:24.878 --> 4:25:25.958]: 
  I still have to read it.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:25:28.354 --> 4:25:29.198]: 
  Basicness.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:25:36.944 --> 4:25:42.951]: 
  He's really embarrassing, I'm a grown man now and I still have to count the rent out on my fingers.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:25:41.972 --> 4:25:45.735]: 
  I'm a grown man. I don't understand

 SPEAKER_06 [4:25:43.812 --> 4:26:24.295]: 
  I'm a broon man, and I go into a fucking restaurant, and I'm like okay What's 15% of $20 what I do is I do 20% all the time because it's easy wait Let's say here's a fun tip for everybody. You're a restaurant. They took 20% It's super easy. I take all you do is take the first digit if it's a two-digit number six It's 20 bucks take the first you multiply by two. Yeah, but what if it's four dollars? What's that? Round up Six bucks six dollar tip. Yeah, so wait and everyone here who likes maths I I like it. I like it. I liked it, but I was bad at it. Okay, but I was just about to say I thought artists were more like I was gonna say artists pretty much don't like maths, but no because two of them

 SPEAKER_03 [4:26:05.715 --> 4:26:06.711]: 
  So it's four dollars.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:26:08.264 --> 4:26:09.445]: 
  So, it's held up. There we go.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:26:09.445 --> 4:26:10.913]: 
  $30 bucks, three times two, six bucks.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:26:14.423 --> 4:26:17.106]: 
  I like it, I like it.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:26:17.984 --> 4:26:18.254]: 
  Bye, everyone.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:26 --> 4:26:18.237]: 
  edit

 SPEAKER_07 [4:26:24.295 --> 4:26:28.497]: 
  It's not that it's it's more like um no I respect that

 SPEAKER_06 [4:26:26.539 --> 4:26:29.779]: 
  No, I respect it. I respect it. I admire it.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:26:27.450 --> 4:26:27.501]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:26:29.020 --> 4:26:29.442]: 
  üstte

 SPEAKER_02 [4:26:29.459 --> 4:26:35.500]: 
  You could like for example it all ties together like color theory is all math you could pick colors that match

 SPEAKER_01 [4:26:35.500 --> 4:26:38.504]: 
  with math you don't have to have an eye for it.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:26:38.200 --> 4:26:39.938]: 
  And I also think that everything's signed together.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:26:38.318 --> 4:26:45.760]: 
  And I also think design, I think design, math people are actually I think decent at design. Yeah, I mean that's not a hand in hand, but I do think that they're...

 SPEAKER_07 [4:26:42.790 --> 4:26:43.583]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:26:43.482 --> 4:26:43.937]: 
  That's not a hand.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:26:45.540 --> 4:26:49.304]: 
  I was about to say that the same time me and Mick boat like code and stuff so you kind of use both

 SPEAKER_05 [4:26:49.304 --> 4:26:54.518]: 
  but we use coding for art related things. Like, Mick uses it for websites and I use it for...

 SPEAKER_01 [4:26:52.999 --> 4:26:53.505]:

 SPEAKER_06 [4:26:58.332 --> 4:27:14.160]:

Like the thing is, no I wasn't saying that was a fact, I was just seeing if that was the case here. Math is not for you. Well how many people are left-handed in this group? Not me. You. Oh, yeah.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:28:18.218 --> 4:28:52.002]: 
  That I really hate as far as our girls. I think because I hate Jackson Pollock. I'll say that much Maybe Picasso has maybe two pieces I think are good because it looks like he put effort into it But for the most part, I mean if you look like a coin coin if you If you're putting this picture to the new bloods out portal, what would the review? What would you review? Would you leave him? Yeah, you're a nice creativity What about that guy?

 SPEAKER_01 [4:29:03.494 --> 4:29:03.764]: 
  thing

 SPEAKER_01 [4:29:05.417 --> 4:29:09.653]: 
  Because it was presented in a way that you've never seen it before. What can that do?

 SPEAKER_02 [4:29:08.691 --> 4:29:14.091]:

 SPEAKER_02 [4:29:34.830 --> 4:29:38.948]: 
  It's realism. It's all his emotion. I just I just had to let my emotion

 SPEAKER_06 [4:29:36.990 --> 4:29:50.828]: 
  I just I just had to let my emotions out. I heard some of the recent really stuck to me It's like you know people I think art went from like expression plus talent to just expression Yeah, I anybody can express themselves. It doesn't make you a fucking interior semantics. It's not

 SPEAKER_01 [4:29:37.935 --> 4:29:38.003]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:29:49.275 --> 4:29:52.718]:

 SPEAKER_06 [4:29:56.127 --> 4:30:11.939]: 
  Actually painting a photo realistic landscape with creativity and weirdness put it in that's art I saw it hang your tire from a different tires that art. I actually think free bleed McGee is really one of my favorite I thought one checker bleeds on thing. Oh, yeah, the spaghetti was too great. I saw this video

 SPEAKER_04 [4:30:09.728 --> 4:30:10.302]: 
 對

 SPEAKER_04 [4:30:10.892 --> 4:30:11.314]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_07 [4:30:11.314 --> 4:30:19.937]: 
  I saw this video, it was totally art. It was at three naked people rolling around a crowd of people and they had to hold them up while they were rolling.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:30:11.939 --> 4:30:13.221]: 
  Very, gaat Promisio as far as...

 SPEAKER_01 [4:30:14.048 --> 4:30:14.672]: 
  Really art?

 SPEAKER_05 [4:30:19.937 --> 4:30:21.507]: 
  they were like going around and yeah I saw that

 SPEAKER_07 [4:30:20.747 --> 4:30:29.657]: 
  Yeah, it's solid. It's calamari and marsy. These people in the audience didn't know what was going on. Just naked people had their ass in their face and they're like, Jesus Christ, that was alright for some reason. They were just rolling down the stairs.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:30:21.507 --> 4:30:22.857]: 
  Can't marry the Marcy.

 SPEAKER_05 [4:30:27.936 --> 4:30:29.539]: 
  for some reason.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:30:28.712 --> 4:30:37.437]: 
  rolling down the drain. I think anyone calls everything art because like you said expression. Expression is not art. I don't think so. I'm sure there's a school of people that argue otherwise.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:30:32.357 --> 4:30:33.876]: 
  Expression is offered.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:30:37.065 --> 4:30:41.993]: 
  I feel like it's a crap shoot. It's like rolling dice like Zach you could dip your

 SPEAKER_04 [4:30:37.437 --> 4:30:38.989]: 
  I feel like it's a

 SPEAKER_01 [4:30:41.993 --> 4:30:45.992]: 
  hand and a bucket of black paint and then just whip it out of canvas

 SPEAKER_02 [4:30:45.992 --> 4:30:50.498]: 
  and then just wait for somebody to say, oh, that really speaks to me. And then you can sit and bullshit around.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:30:49.992 --> 4:31:02.007]: 
  bullshit them for a couple hours and be like here here's what I was thinking about but truthfully See all these black dots those are all the African Americans that aren't getting

 SPEAKER_00 [4:30:53.147 --> 4:30:56.505]: 
  But truthfully, you went black paint. Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:30:55.442 --> 4:30:55.662]: 
  back.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:31:02.007 --> 4:31:06.951]: 
  Just call I also think that the people who think that they're good are all like bullshitting themselves because they want

 SPEAKER_05 [4:31:06.951 --> 4:31:08.993]: 
  to seem like they're higher up than other people.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:31:08.031 --> 4:31:10.326]: 
  They're just nuts...

 SPEAKER_02 [4:31:08.993 --> 4:31:17.549]: 
  Go to eBay, type in painting and then sort it from highest price to lowest price and you will see exactly what I'm talking about.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:31:17.549 --> 4:31:19.860]: 
  I was about to say that. I would be like, you know what, I would be like, you know what,

 SPEAKER_01 [4:31:19.219 --> 4:31:24.585]: 
  It's all splatter paintings dudes asking buy it now price for five million dollars. I didn't like waiting

 SPEAKER_07 [4:31:23.269 --> 4:31:29.462]: 
  I could sit in my bare ass in paint and then sit on a canvas and say like it's a beautiful butterfly

 SPEAKER_02 [4:31:28.770 --> 4:31:34.997]: 
  You could do what that one guy doesn't pump paint up his ass and spray it out on campus. Someone does that? Yes.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:31:32.179 --> 4:31:34.002]: 
  Someone does that? Well, that one up there.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:31:34.002 --> 4:31:34.390]: 
  me

 SPEAKER_01 [4:31:34.997 --> 4:31:39.942]: 
  do that like ties wires to his back and then he covers his whole body with paint and just swings

 SPEAKER_07 [4:31:39.942 --> 4:31:46.202]: 
  into gambas' like Spider-Man and then he sells those. It's bullshit. It's completely bullshit.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:31:44.616 --> 4:31:52.497]: 
  I'd probably buy a whole lot of them. You never see those side by side where it's like... And granted, it's not that it's not creative, but it's still bullshit. It's still bullshit. It's not like...

 SPEAKER_07 [4:31:50.944 --> 4:31:52.935]: 
  It's not bullshit, it's not what it is.

 SPEAKER_05 [4:31:52.497 --> 4:31:56.901]: 
  There's no expression. That's literally what it is. He swung his body in a thing.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:31:56.057 --> 4:32:09.456]: 
  I never see a side by side person was this done by a famous artist or a five year old? It's like That sounds amazing I think there was a couple years ago there was a five year old who was like throwing paint on a canvas And we sell you for a fucking lot of money. They did that in New York!

 SPEAKER_02 [4:31:59.652 --> 4:32:02.520]: 
  Just like you make the sideways like oh Cause look at that

 SPEAKER_02 [4:32:08.950 --> 4:32:22.939]: 
  New York, there was like that abstract museum and then they intentionally did that where they got a bunch of finger paintings from first grade kindergarten students and they hung them all up and then all these art critics went there and they were like, oh I love the use of color.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:32:22.939 --> 4:32:26.196]: 
  It was children that did them. Exactly, that's my point. It's exactly it.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:32:26.196 --> 4:33:07.962]: 
  They don't know what the target is. You think, like the dudes at like, RapeMyPoop.com? Like they actually... That is over there. They carried in a turd in a duffel bag or in a plastic container. I get those confused. And they went to one of the art people and they were like, here, they showed them. And there's like googly eyes in Planted. I remember a turd that was raided turd and had googly eyes as a looking back at you. Do you think he presented that turd to an art place and they gave him $4 million? You know, Collin, it's fucked up, but I honestly think if you gave a petrified two googly eyes to an art museum, they'd put it up. They would. Not only that, but I have it. Because it's art. It's real. I don't want to talk the story of work. Realistically, when a poop comes out, it's looking back at you. That's the only thing it sees. It's looking up. It's not looking down. It's looking up. So you wash it away.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:32:55.812 --> 4:32:59.929]: 
  Not only that, but I have- Because it's art. It's real. I don't think I've told this story before.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:33:07.607 --> 4:33:10.492]: 
  It's metaphor for the poor looking up at society, man.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:33:10.004 --> 4:34:07.750]: 
  Lady got like sued because she was like a janitor at an art museum But she drew a bunch of garbage into a trash can and the artist was like that was art And he's like got her in trouble. What the fuck? So there is a village in Germany cleaver Germany and you can look it up and at the top of this village There's a there's a hill the whole thing's built on a hill There's a castle at the top and this whole village cleaver is famous for an artist that they had It's one of the things are famous for that an artist that was very famous there And he got so pissed off that everybody loved his work no matter what he did Everybody would say oh, yes Amazing amazing and they'd come and he got so pissed off at it. He was like finally He just pooped in a box and everyone Not only did they love it No, if you they should have if you go to the castle It is the centerpiece of the museum of the floor that is dedicated to him It is literally the biggest f you to himself. Yeah, that he could have possibly done

 SPEAKER_02 [4:33:19.116 --> 4:33:19.385]: 
  So

 SPEAKER_04 [4:33:50.740 --> 4:33:50.942]: 
  Fuck.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:33:50.942 --> 4:33:55.499]: 
  loved it not only did they love it so they put the lights on it no if you

 SPEAKER_04 [4:34:01.574 --> 4:34:02.451]: 
  That is dead and killed.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:34:02.502 --> 4:34:03.042]: 
  to them.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:34:07.193 --> 4:34:26.684]: 
  That's why art works and that's why comedy works. The first rule of comedy is people always laugh and they're always receptive of things that they've never seen before. That's why things are funny. That's why it triggers in your mind. You get something, you know, never mind a meme. A meme is funny or something random is funny the first time you see it.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:34:26.160 --> 4:34:34.615]: 
  I feel like people see that and try to be artificially random. Right, yeah. Try to be artificially creative and say all the... But they're still missing the point. Right, exactly.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:34:32.724 --> 4:34:39.491]: 
  But they're still missing the point. It's something you've never seen before. It's like, again, like there's another gallery in New York that...

 SPEAKER_01 [4:34:39.491 --> 4:34:42.951]: 
  The centerpiece pieces was a pig's head. They cut off a

 SPEAKER_02 [4:34:42.951 --> 4:34:47.169]: 
  So the head of a pig and they put it in a confined acrylic box.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:34:47.169 --> 4:34:51.404]: 
  and the art piece was watching the pig's head rise.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:34:51.404 --> 4:34:53.937]: 
  and just gather bugs and do all that.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:34:53.937 --> 4:35:06.998]: 
  Every time you went back and you saw you just see the pig head rot and it's something that nobody's seen before But that's art and people paid Astronomical amounts of money to see a fucking pig head rot in a box But it's awesome

 SPEAKER_02 [4:35:06.998 --> 4:35:10.794]: 
  That's something that nobody's seen before, that's all it is. And it works with a lot of stuff.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:35:09.023 --> 4:35:53.961]: 
  and it works with a lot of stuff. Well, I was gonna say, that's probably why if you look at the paintings that are most expensive, they're the ones that look just like random ass bullshit, because if you have a painting that looks like something else, your mind can comprehend what you're seeing. And you might even be able to put a value on that. But if you're looking at paint splatters or some like weird abstract piece of shit, because you don't quote unquote understand it, you try to fill in the blanks and all of a sudden the worth of it is so- Because it's undefined-able in terms of its worth. It's almost like a self-appreciation. It's like you get, you assign it your own worth, so you're kind of assigning yourself that price. The more you care about the random piece of thing, the more you're equivocating it to your own value. You're really paying for your own opinion there, right? Exactly, you're paying for your own opinion. This is what I feel it is, and I feel this is the best example, and this is what I, you know what I mean?

 SPEAKER_02 [4:35:42.503 --> 4:35:44.730]: 
  the more you care about this random piece of shit.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:35:46.705 --> 4:35:46.755]: 
  You

 SPEAKER_00 [4:35:46.755 --> 4:35:48.392]: 
  You really take the road of pity.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:35:48.392 --> 4:35:50.383]: 
  Exactly, you were paying for your opening.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:35:53.640 --> 4:36:02.500]: 
  I want to hold a focus group for paintings. I want to show one painting and then bring 20 people in and say, write your honest opinion down on this piece of paper. And every opinion is...

 SPEAKER_01 [4:36:02.500 --> 4:36:05.992]: 
  It's gonna be a fucking Travis day at the end of it because nobody's gonna have

 SPEAKER_06 [4:36:05.588 --> 4:36:14.549]: 
  Have the same that's what the capital is yellow. That's what they that's people they know what they're doing and they're saying That's the art. I'm sure I'm sure that they would say well. That's the point is that people interpret differently

 SPEAKER_02 [4:36:14.464 --> 4:36:18.530]: 
  No, what they're saying is you just don't understand it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. And if you pay enough money, then you're done.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:36:18.143 --> 4:36:30.241]: 
  What's funny too is sometimes you have the audience be like, you know, somebody else who paid you a big oh it's a metaphor for the Jews killed in the Holocaust. No, it was drawn at an apple at a different angle.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:36:18.530 --> 4:36:19.949]: 
  22 is a lot of...

 SPEAKER_01 [4:36:28.032 --> 4:36:28.437]: 
  It's like, what?

 SPEAKER_04 [4:36:28.437 --> 4:36:28.943]: 
  one of those different

 SPEAKER_02 [4:36:28.943 --> 4:36:35.929]: 
  It's like one of those bullshit movies that has like an ending that's just open to interpretation Yeah, it's so easy

 SPEAKER_01 [4:36:30.241 --> 4:36:30.310]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:36:33.077 --> 4:36:38.764]: 
  So everyone's in forums like no it meant this

 SPEAKER_02 [4:36:38.764 --> 4:36:42.375]: 
  It meant this. Oh no, you're stupid. It meant this. It's easy to put.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:36:41.363 --> 4:36:57.377]: 
  It's easy to pander people's personal because if you read a book it's like you imagine what the main character looks like It's the best version of your head So it's a really kind of an easy way to get out of things I think the other big you said you know the you know the luck to your prediction at these are always really lazy It's like literally it's what the person wants to be the audience is so too

 SPEAKER_00 [4:36:56.466 --> 4:37:04.244]: 
  The audience is so terrified that they're not gonna do a job that they're like, you decide man, I'm not, I'm not, I don't want to write it, I'm not writing it. I think there are cases where...

 SPEAKER_06 [4:37:01.461 --> 4:37:01.596]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:37:02.997 --> 4:37:10.438]: 
  I think there are cases where like if you've set it up right I feel like there are times maybe it could be kind of fun and playful but if it's so lazy it's just like I don't know

 SPEAKER_01 [4:37:06.861 --> 4:37:07.553]: 
  Maybe.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:37:10.438 --> 4:37:20.952]: 
  You decide so last thing so you sit do you think when I see an amazing painting done by somebody in fucking 1824 I look at it in a technical way

 SPEAKER_02 [4:37:20.952 --> 4:37:27.499]: 
  way but most people don't respect it they're upstairs looking at all the contemporary art I'm looking at it in this way

 SPEAKER_01 [4:37:27.499 --> 4:37:28.444]: 
  way but it's

 SPEAKER_02 [4:37:28.444 --> 4:37:31.886]: 
  something that everyone's seen before so they don't care about that. Definitely.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:37:31.802 --> 4:37:39.447]: 
  Well, it's the other product, they look at it, okay, that's that's They see like these amazing marble statues before, like, anyone really knew how to carve marble and you're like

 SPEAKER_02 [4:37:33.372 --> 4:37:33.794]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:37:39.447 --> 4:37:45.505]: 
  like wow nobody I know in this entire life span could ever carve a human statue

 SPEAKER_01 [4:37:45.505 --> 4:37:47.800]: 
  out of marble with that kind of detail.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:37:47.007 --> 4:37:51.951]: 
  In fairness though, they became what's called like

 SPEAKER_05 [4:37:51.951 --> 4:37:56.152]: 
  not interns but what's the word when they someone takes them on to do the

 SPEAKER_04 [4:37:55.950 --> 4:37:57.267]: 
  to help them out.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:37:56.558 --> 4:38:01.349]: 
  Apprentice? Apprentice, yeah, they became them when they were like 14 and that's all they did until they were 20 something. It's still...

 SPEAKER_02 [4:38:01.148 --> 4:38:05.939]: 
  It's still amazing work, but people always look at it, like the corner of their eye and they just walk past it.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:38:05.939 --> 4:39:05.965]: 
  Well, it's because because they know it is right they can see okay This is this person's skill level this is this person is how long it probably took them this one looks like that I did a but if you walk up it's pretty basically it's self masturbation. That's what people are pandering through these days It's self masturbation. It's it's you know, it's it's it's you Projecting your own opinions and whatever you know, whatever you want it to like it actually matters I was gonna say when I look for art the things I'm looking for in art is two things Either a half naked girl or the art is like, you know, it's a path But it's like a unique kind of style like there's that one art piece where it's like the path is constantly going up But it tricks your eyes into thinking it resets an Escher. Yeah, that was an issue That stuff to me is really cool So something that you look at that fucks with your vision like something that if it like you look at a dot in the middle And then like you can see shit other than that my opinion that kind of artists Are you talking about optical illusions? Yeah, it is fun art though I want to be a squad. I would actually rather have a piece of optical

 SPEAKER_03 [4:38:25.195 --> 4:38:25.431]: 
  Like a

 SPEAKER_04 [4:38:25.667 --> 4:38:26.223]: 
  It actually matters.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:38:43.993 --> 4:38:46.829]: 
  Yeah, that was an accurate game.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:38:56.700 --> 4:38:58.945]: 
  Are you talking about optical illusion? Yeah!

 SPEAKER_02 [4:38:58.945 --> 4:38:59.619]: 
  That is for sure.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:39:00.312 --> 4:39:01.442]: 
  I want to be school

 SPEAKER_04 [4:39:01.442 --> 4:39:02.016]: 
  I would actually

 SPEAKER_07 [4:39:03.889 --> 4:39:09.947]: 
  That's what I'm saying. You're talking about like on Facebook where it's like Yeah! Stare at the dock. The book is so cool.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:39:04.007 --> 4:39:04.497]: 
  That's where it needs to be.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:39:07.737 --> 4:39:10.368]: 
  Bam- yeah, stare at the dock, coolies Yes

 SPEAKER_06 [4:39:08.952 --> 4:39:22.401]: 
  It's so close! Yes! Yes! I want that on my wall. Looking at the green square. I want that on my wall with a naked girl next to it. It's perfect. It's like, this keeps your attention and this keeps your attention. Okay, cool.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:39:10.368 --> 4:39:14.047]: 
  Yes, I want that on my wall. Looking to green square.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:39:13.439 --> 4:39:13.456]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_07 [4:39:22.012 --> 4:39:25.945]: 
  Or she's quoted and then when you look at the dot and then look at her, you'll make it. That would be a perfect.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:39:24.139 --> 4:39:56.286]: 
  That would be perfect. Kori, Kori, Kori. The dot in her pussy, dude. It's both. No, what I mean is- Isn't that Kori? You can do that. You can do that to put all over her titties. And then like, since it makes your vision all fucked up, you like look at her and then her titties are twisting and it's like kinda like, you know- No, what I'm saying is for the kids out there, hey, kitties, if you wanna have nudie pics up in your house, Okay. You can do some cool optical illusion stuff where like you have to stare at like a green dot for five seconds. It's really hard to do that. And then look at the picture and you'll see this beautiful naked thing.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:39:24.443 --> 4:39:24.493]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:39:25.945 --> 4:39:27.447]: 
  Koi! Koi! Koi!

 SPEAKER_00 [4:39:26.939 --> 4:39:27.413]: 
  It's going.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:39:32.256 --> 4:39:32.491]: 
  And then

 SPEAKER_00 [4:39:38.314 --> 4:39:38.331]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [4:39:54.987 --> 4:39:57.805]: 
  I'll win. I'll win. Naked guy, girl, whatever you like.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:39:57.805 --> 4:40:01.939]: 
  What do you think? Let's do it. If you just walked into the room with parents who never know, they'd have to be scared

 SPEAKER_00 [4:39:58.935 --> 4:40:00.437]: 
  I'm sick of it.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:40:00.437 --> 4:40:01.281]: 
  You're a pain to never know.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:40:01.939 --> 4:40:07.474]: 
  at green and red dots. To go back a couple. Get a bonus.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:40:05.348 --> 4:40:06.276]: 
  Yeah, get it.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:40:06.276 --> 4:40:09.449]: 
  Don the pussy

 SPEAKER_03 [4:40:07.474 --> 4:40:07.947]: 
  Thanks!

 SPEAKER_06 [4:40:07.947 --> 4:40:16.907]: 
  Thank you, thank you sir! Yeah, alright, so you need a fucking decoder ring to enjoy it. Yeah, that's right. Next question. Wait, we need to go on to the next question. Alright, so next up from Poteeto...

 SPEAKER_02 [4:40:15.591 --> 4:40:19.506]: 
  So next up from how does the decoder ring work with a dot pussy gone?

 SPEAKER_06 [4:40:19.506 --> 4:41:01.491]: 
  Cuz you put the label on and it tells you which picture to look at okay, it's all the glittering. No anyways, all right boys Yeah, be biscuit asks what's an easy to learn hard to master aspect of animation? There's a new one easy to learn hard to master easy to learn. I would say this I would say all the principles of the animation general There's probably five or six things you really need to know we're animating It's easy to learn with those are and know what those are and though you have to do those for applying But actually apply those in unison it like a nice dance is super hard. Here you go keyframe People think like yeah, you can key framing simple you get to the first point to the last point But there's a lot of stuff you kind of have to know

 SPEAKER_04 [4:40:23.995 --> 4:40:25.800]: 
  No, anyways.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:40:26.577 --> 4:40:26.999]: 
  Yes.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:40:38.204 --> 4:40:39.368]: 
  I would say this.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:41:00.327 --> 4:41:28.997]: 
  There's a lot of moving cards moving at different rates. It's not hard. It's tedious. Everyone has a different method of animating. Everyone in this room right now animates in a very different way. So you can't say that it's hard. It was hard for me. When somebody's asking, they're looking for a direction in that. And there is no direction because everybody does things their own way. If I opened up one of Zach's files, my mind would be blown. And vice versa. And anyone else in this room. Everybody does.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:41:13.287 --> 4:41:13.540]: 
  We'll talk about that later.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:41:14.147 --> 4:41:14.940]: 
  Pense generous.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:41:14.940 --> 4:41:15.497]: 
  asking

 SPEAKER_07 [4:41:15.497 --> 4:41:17.084]: 
  They're looking for a...

 SPEAKER_06 [4:41:28.997 --> 4:41:45.366]: 
  things very differently it's all about your bottom line and how you want to get it out. It's it you you will find your own way of doing stuff I would just say feel it out look at everything you have and try to apply it your own way and you'll find your own formula you'll find oh this this way works well I click with this way.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:41:32.879 --> 4:41:33.182]: 
  It's

 SPEAKER_01 [4:41:45.332 --> 4:41:51.019]: 
  And I was just talking about Flash too. Yeah, yeah, exactly, Flash too. There's other programs and other methods.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:41:49.973 --> 4:44:32.024]: 
  Other programs, other you could do CG, you could do puppet animation, you could do tweeting, you could do frame by frame, you could do limited frame by frame, you could do a bunch of different things. Stop motion, stop motion, do it. So for me though, it was key in getting that down. For me, because they asked what we, what is hard. And for me, it was getting keys and following through with the keys because you put a key and then you go through with it. But for me, there was always like, I had to kind of had to learn how many frames would go in between that or if I wanted to exaggerate certain things. And then sometimes I would change the keys or add in more keys because I didn't like how those keys were laid out. What I, what I tried to do, and this is what I try to do in general now with animation, I think it's the easiest thing to do is it's really easy to get carried away and do these straight ahead and do kind of micro-manual thing. But what I do is I do key frames, I set, basically I divide it more and more and more. So maybe the end of this animation has 50 frames, but I start off with two. So you keep your key frame, then put one in the middle there, it'll break down. Then put one's between those, then put one's between those, then put one's between those. So it's kind of, I kind of happen constantly. Well, actually, now for me, it's kind of like what I do is, since I'm doing like game development, so I'm doing characters constantly. I have full bodies to work with, but I have them kind of not in a T-shape like bullshit 3D, but just in their standard stand position. And I pretty much take their area of perspective and I work within that area. So if they're punching, they're by, I take their static position and I draw them punching over that, kind of like an, like that's the overlay for me. And if they're like surprised or anything, I use the original static position. And that's pretty much how I do keys. And it retains the same shape. So you don't get that wonky off the shape things because you have your original thing you were following, you were just moving with that. And I do that a lot for animation now. Like if I have a key, I'll work within the key, I'll take the head. And if the head's supposed to be looking up, I'll draw within the head if he's looking forward, but I just know the perspective is looking up. So I kind of got to figure out the shape. And then you adjust the body later if you have to to compensate that. But you have the body there as a reference, the original. It's kind of what onion skinning is though. Yeah, it's like you set an onion skin layer and fucking Jeff has completely warped my way of animating, I'll be honest. In a good way. Before it used to be more like really freehand. Wait, where is Jeff? Oh yeah! On his way here, he didn't honk his horn like he's supposed to because it's kind of like the uniform rule. And the deep guys fucking voted off the road in the medics dude. They all crashed into him, they all rolled him off the street. Deep guys beep at each other? Basically, if you don't honk your horn or wave at them or you know, acknowledge other J people when they wave at you, they will fucking hunt you down. They recognize you too. What number is that?

 SPEAKER_00 [4:41:59.119 --> 4:42:00.081]: 
  mas está falando descτό

 SPEAKER_01 [4:42:54.081 --> 4:42:55.380]: 
  It's like a cell dividing.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:42:54.469 --> 4:42:54.486]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_07 [4:42:55.380 --> 4:42:55.397]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [4:43:51.085 --> 4:43:52.941]: 
  And then you adjust the body later if you want.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:43:52.941 --> 4:43:54.460]: 
  Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:43:54.764 --> 4:43:55.185]: 
  But you have

 SPEAKER_07 [4:43:56.738 --> 4:43:58.949]: 
  That's kind of what onion skinning is though. Yeah, it's like a huge...

 SPEAKER_04 [4:44:10.120 --> 4:44:10.491]: 
  Jeff

 SPEAKER_00 [4:44:16.988 --> 4:44:17.849]: 
  We need to deal with it.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:44:19.317 --> 4:44:22.320]: 
  They all fell and crashed into them and they all rolled them off the street.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:44:30.218 --> 4:44:31.585]: 
  They really laze you too.

 SPEAKER_05 [4:44:31.500 --> 4:44:36.259]: 
  But is that actually a thing like that they do honk at each other?

 SPEAKER_06 [4:44:35.230 --> 4:44:41.710]: 
  Yeah, he's recording Evo right now. Yeah, he's underware. He's T-vowing Evo with a sweatband on

 SPEAKER_02 [4:44:38.065 --> 4:44:38.453]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:44:38.520 --> 4:44:39.347]: 
  At least underwater.

 SPEAKER_05 [4:44:38.723 --> 4:44:38.757]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:44:41.710 --> 4:44:44.933]: 
  Next question W Boland

 SPEAKER_06 [4:44:44.933 --> 4:45:29.618]: 
  Dorf asks, what complications have you run into over the course of season one of Sleepy Guest and how have you overcome them? Examples given, technical issues, scheduling conflicts, etc. I would say, I don't know if we've overcome it, I feel like we've gotten better at that fucking up as much. I feel like the biggest thing, you know, a lot of people don't hear themselves talk a lot, so you first hear yourself. It took me a couple of podcasts to kind of talk slower and talk more, people are clearer. And it's also a lot of people, yeah, a lot of people also have little quirks or say a certain word a bunch of times literally or something, whatever it is. And you go, oh fuck, you tried to correct it. So I think that was what sister's day was kind of listening to yourself talking, going, oh god, that's what I sound like and trying to be more concise and stuff.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:45:13.992 --> 4:45:14.481]: 
  Nice, yeah.

 SPEAKER_05 [4:45:29.483 --> 4:45:44.198]: 
  And also a new thing so that we do that like, you know, just so everyone's on the same kind of page is that like I'd edit it I do like a kind of like one edit and then I send it over to like stamper a Chris or someone or Mick to like just refine it That that like hope it's a price. It's a price. It's a good

 SPEAKER_06 [4:45:42.021 --> 4:46:17.897]: 
  I hope so. It's a prize. It's like a model T-line, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think one of the biggest complications you run into, especially when the group gets bigger and bigger, is talking over each other. And that was something that we still work on. And I feel like we've done a pretty good job considering the amount of people that are in the podcast talking and just like our personalities. So I think that that was definitely one of the biggest. The first like four episodes, I didn't know what to fucking act like, because it was just weird putting a microphone in front of you for like the first few. Same thing as being on camera the first few times, just like, ugh, what the fuck am I supposed to do? But it didn't just get used to it, you're just like normal.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:46:04.397 --> 4:46:04.752]: 
  first

 SPEAKER_05 [4:46:11.181 --> 4:46:11.637]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_05 [4:46:14.100 --> 4:46:14.421]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:46:15.484 --> 4:46:16.176]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:46:18.539 --> 4:46:51.782]: 
  Was that it? As far as complications? You said more. I mean, you know, it also just... Sometimes your fucking recording equipment died and that shit, but we figured it out. I think, you know, yeah, definitely we had some... There have been times where if I could spill the secrets after all these months, there was episode five, the Rogue Finger, we did that entire Christmas versus Halloween debate, and it deleted. Yeah. So the one you hear was we were all defeated, Stamper like walked out, we were all just like, oh my god. That old owl was gone and Stamper came back with some beer as usual. Let's just do this again, man.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:46:20.985 --> 4:46:22.892]: 
  Oh, I mean, you know, I also just...

 SPEAKER_05 [4:46:25.491 --> 4:46:25.913]: 
  I think

 SPEAKER_04 [4:46:25.913 --> 4:46:25.930]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_07 [4:46:46.855 --> 4:46:47.952]: 
  Olha이를 killers

 SPEAKER_05 [4:46:51.749 --> 4:46:54.938]: 
  Yeah, and then it was so funny because we're so camera like, oh man, we're so defeated.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:46:54.938 --> 4:46:58.212]: 
  And then Stanley goes anyway, fuck it. And like you just put it right back in your ear.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:46:56.929 --> 4:47:04.742]: 
  Yeah, yeah, so that whole debate we pretty much already had but I think we added enough to it to where it felt organic and real organic.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:47:04.101 --> 4:47:06.497]: 
  You see, yeah. But if you listen to it, if you listen to it with that,

 SPEAKER_06 [4:47:06.497 --> 4:47]: 
  Whatever I'm really exact point it was whatever I would be I don't cut up whatever I was talking about Easter or something It's simple. It's like anyways Christmas. I think we actually made up a user I think we made up a person who has the question that we made up a fake person Yes, that question. Oh because I'll tell you what happened was we was always talking Easter It's very naturally went into Christmas and Halloween, but we had to come back to it I can't remember how we sing way to it, right? So we said, okay

 SPEAKER_01 [4:47:19.525 --> 4:47:20.402]: 
  But he has a question.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:47 --> 4:47:36.940]: 
  Okay, this person asks, which is better? That person doesn't exist. So there's my... I didn't even know...

 SPEAKER_00 [4:47:35.505 --> 4:47:41.496]: 
  I didn't even know that Really spilling the beans, Zach We're in deep waters now, Zach

 SPEAKER_07 [4:47:36.940 --> 4:47:39.944]: 
  Really spilling the beans, Zach.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:47:38.492 --> 4:47:45.495]: 
  There's deep waters now Zach. There's a scale to our claws. Well while we're here, why don't we just let it all hang out. Yeah, I got it.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:47:42.559 --> 4:47:48.938]: 
  While we're here, why don't we just let it all hang out? Yeah, kill all of them. I feel so good to have that off my chest after all these months. I know, I know.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:47:47.132 --> 4:48:35.513]: 
  I know I know Was a fucking nightmare. Oh, why is that why it was so short? Oh, yeah, it was like a lot longer But it got like so we're all sitting around here and then fucking it got to the point where no one knew what to do And we were all improvising and it got really stressful and then Jeff literally like left So then we wrote that into it where And then we started killing off people and that's what we started killing off people's because Jeff left and we just decided to Do that then I had to fucking rearrange all the portions of that podcast to like flow naturally Yeah, and that the fucking put in all the sound effects and that was a fucking I think that's that's one of the complications I mean it seems obvious to us that editing is a big part of it But I think there are certain people that have this have a misconception that it's basically just we just word-vom it and then print it Go no and that what I have

 SPEAKER_01 [4:47:48.938 --> 4:47:48.955]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:47:51.368 --> 4:47:53.207]: 
  Oh, what? Is that why it was so short?

 SPEAKER_03 [4:48:21.068 --> 4:48:21.085]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:48:33.944 --> 4:48:40.947]: 
  Gullo and that but I have to give Corey props because at first he was all the ones of Corey and it was so difficult to edit but now he's so like

 SPEAKER_05 [4:48:40.947 --> 4:48:42.938]: 
  like calm and know what knows like what's

 SPEAKER_06 [4:48:41.504 --> 4:48:43.275]: 
  and know what knows like what to do.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:48:42.668 --> 4:48:44.474]: 
  Good job, Cory. You're a good boy, Cory. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:48:44.440 --> 4:48:55.493]: 
  Thank you. I think eventually though, because a lot of people would ask me, what kind of improvements would you like to make? I think eventually I'd like to, I think a good actual proper mic setup would be where we each have a microphone at some point.

 SPEAKER_05 [4:48:54.008 --> 4:48:57.029]: 
  I think sure we start off at one so yeah

 SPEAKER_06 [4:48:56.809 --> 4:49:19.185]: 
  Yeah, I think if we get to the point where we all have an auto microphones, we all have a good audio quality We all we don't have like, you know interference in the background. So that's that's a point we'd like to get to I'd like, you know more obviously people ask for this too, but I'd like more commercials more written stuff kind of fun Improvised. Yeah, I would love that that would definitely add to it. Yeah, that's a plan When we do revisit this in the future fall, I really feel like

 SPEAKER_02 [4:49:10.984 --> 4:49:11.946]: 
  I would love that.

 SPEAKER_03 [4:49:12.672 --> 4:49:12.874]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:49:12.874 --> 4:49:13.009]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:49:19.860 --> 4:51:30.439]: 
  There will you will hear it people think oh, it's gonna be reimagined. It's like no basically what's gonna happen is we're gonna take the time to Regroup because I mean to be honest this all happened so fast the page has happened They try to happen and like within two months we hit we met like fucking six goals So it was just like oh, okay, and none of us ever everyone already had full-time jobs So we had all created all these issues already and I feel now with this new season we can buy the shit We can prepare ahead of time so none of this oh Friday. Sorry. I'm Saturday Maybe Tuesday none of this kind of stuff where we can leaving it will be out every Friday at a time Which we will have an actual time frame when we do it again So I would expect it within a certain time and also I think something else I would say don't consider the air quotes season 2 of this podcast to be like a reboot Or like a reimagining it's just what they should be We get the pilot I guess we just do like this for that. It's like a trial. It's kind of like a trial It's not a real error. So this is kind of like the kind of okay This will get wrong on this like a pilot season pilot season the extended very long pilot the operate once Yeah, what is that two hours times 30? Oh, it's even more than that because lots of a lot of students do I think there's almost a hundred hours of oh my god That's like four days, I think there is if it's not a hundred it's 75 or 80. I mean it's a lot. It's up there Yeah, next question next question Super duke-ness asks Do you think that traditional animation will ever make a comeback to the big screen? That's a really if you're talking about if you're talking about TV show film adaptations like a family guy movie a Simpsons movie No, no, I think they're asking like Disney. Yeah, is there gonna be another Lion King? I'd like to think but I don't think immediately. No, yes underground. Yes mainstream though Yeah, I don't think Disney, you know, maybe you'll get like a weird off one here and there or something 3d 2d shit It's so yeah, I don't think it'll be full on 2d. I feel you get like it like what's what's that one paper man? Oh, yeah, yeah, it's something like that. You're not gonna get I don't think you can you're gonna see full on 2d

 SPEAKER_03 [4:49:32.753 --> 4:49:33.276]: 
  It's not to asama.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:50:17.387 --> 4:50:18.383]: 
  It's a...

 SPEAKER_05 [4:50:22.298 --> 4:50:24.593]: 
  It's in a real good way. So this is kind of like the...

 SPEAKER_00 [4:50:28.525 --> 4:50:28.795]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:50:33.419 --> 4:50:36.507]: 
  Oh, it's even more than that because a lot of us do.

 SPEAKER_00 [4:50:38.717 --> 4:50:40.506]: 
  Oh my god.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:50:40.506 --> 4:50:40.962]:

 SPEAKER_04 [4:50:59.187 --> 4:50:59.254]:

 SPEAKER_00 [4:51:06.510 --> 4:51:06.949]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:51:11.387 --> 4:51:12.653]: 
  Yes, underground.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:51:14.273 --> 4:51:15.674]: 
  Yeah, I don't think Disney...

 SPEAKER_04 [4:51:14.442 --> 4:51:14.459]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:51:15.674 --> 4:51:15.741]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:51:30.439 --> 4:51:34.945]: 
  videos are trying to produce content and they're gonna do it as efficiently as possible.

 SPEAKER_07 [4:51:34.945 --> 4:51:37.004]: 
  Exactly that's what I was gonna say like drawing every single

 SPEAKER_05 [4:51:37.004 --> 4:51:41.813]: 
  The frame is too complicated while you can have a model that you can move around is much more practical and easy

 SPEAKER_01 [4:51:41.087 --> 4:51:47.787]: 
  Traditional animation it's really charming, but at the same time I as much as I respect it. Yeah, yeah, absolutely very

 SPEAKER_06 [4:51:46.420 --> 4:52:02.181]: 
  Yeah, absolutely. It is very... What's the term? Time consuming. It's incredibly time consuming. I'll say this, right? I love 2D, I love fanat 2D, I love C-Cove back, but I completely understand why it left. If I was the head of a company, I would have done the exact same thing. I think it would have been...

 SPEAKER_01 [4:51:51.381 --> 4:51:51.904]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_01 [4:51:52.697 --> 4:51:53.929]: 
  I love you.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:52:01.489 --> 4:52:04.915]: 
  The bottom line is you're trying to put a little come on you

 SPEAKER_07 [4:52:03.717 --> 4:52:09.218]: 
  Try to run a company and try to get that. Those new Mickey Mouse shorts, Disney or something. I love a company. Me too. Here's the thing though.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:52:06.923 --> 4:55:34.047]: 
  I love those. Where 3d has gone in my opinion there is stuff that's a little eh, but there's also stuff that's very impressive like Sony animation studios which did like Hotel Transylvania and Is that cloudy cloudy with a chick? Yeah, it's great cloudy with a chance of meatballs Yeah Though the way it's animated is exactly like a traditional cartoon. It's very nice. I've actually seen the smears and exactly Like some of the what's the other thing smears and watching stress no no no where you see like multiples Exactly, you can actually see them but in three they do that That looks really fucking Trailer as well look great. Yeah, like the peanuts would have like little black You look like a little like hipster douchebag Like he's like he completely lost everything that made him a man Boy apparently their defense was it was a prequel story But how he got to pop my my honest opinion though It feels more like you can't you can't be smoking a fucking like wicker pipe and he definitely can't be having tattoos Yeah, it was a sailor you fucking be not anymore What did I say wicker pipe So basically I feel like there 3d is Intriguing traditional animation stuff into its apartment and I do feel like what it was before It's kind of experimenting you get a lot of really experimental 3d stuff now And I do think 3d is a good medium as well when it's done, right? I do think 3d can be lazy when I say this to I feel I feel like there's also parallel to be said about 2d and Traditional props and stuff. Mm-hmm. There was a dry period in both film like where where 2d died 3d took over completely for cartoons. Yeah, and also at the same time There's also a point where traditional props and stuff that are completely again CG took over. Yeah, I feel like now people are going. Okay. Do you kind of exhaust? That's true. Yeah, no, so now you've seen a reintroduction of Practical effects absolutely. It's always so I think so I think you kind of see a good balance of that kind of reemerging Maybe not fully I don't think it's only be fully back where it was in the 80s and 70s and 80s and 90s and stuff But I definitely feel like 2d is probably gonna come back a little bit like it'd be used within 3d It'll be done differently. It'll be back in a way and I feel like same thing with traditional props It's fascinating to me how this happens like Back then there was like retro games, right? And people were all about retro games and then like these like New Age like Gears of War introduced this new style where everything was very greedy and dark and gray and then games come out and they try different things and then like evolve from there But people are like when retro games come out have a retro feeling like an old nest game He used to play it has that nest style people are really invested in it and like for instance I think rocksmith is coming back again and people are all hyped about that like rocksmith and like like rock band is coming back Like they're re-releasing rock band because like it is it came full circle people got fucking tired of it But that tired is now away and people are like can we get a new game like something I'm bored I want to play fucking rock band again. They're coming back. Yeah, exactly. And that's what's happening. It's just like things reset Yeah, I mean even shit like fucking a haircut to clothing Like the 80s I feel like I feel like I feel like now like the hair like it's like almost like the 50s and 60s a weird

 SPEAKER_03 [4:52:25.823 --> 4:52:26.059]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:52:39.070 --> 4:52:40.622]: 
  Oh, that's all the mirrors here.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:52:40.504 --> 4:52:46.950]: 
  Exactly, yeah. You can actually see them in 3D. They do that. They have these in-transmit- You're making it right. This is the same movie. Oh yeah, I saw that.

 SPEAKER_04 [4:52:46.950 --> 4:52:47.862]:

 SPEAKER_07 [4:55:33.524 --> 4:55:35.768]: 
  When will it be acceptable to have a Hitler mustache again?

 SPEAKER_06 [4:55:35.920 --> 4:56:04.439]: 
  I think you knocked that out of the puck for a little while. That's good to sit on the sideline. Because there was a long period of time I remember when having a puck called. You didn't kill like a few thousand years. Paul was really douchey and faggy. But I guess it's come back because you do it all the time. That's because I'm cool. But like even the beard thing was out. Having a beard was kind of that really itself for a while. It's like the last couple years it's kind of come back. Oh it's come back quite a bit because of all the craft beer stuff. It only moves in cycles basically. I thought you said beards. I did say beards. Oh I thought you said beard. No you freak. I said beards. Beards.

  Bonne soirée.

 SPEAKER_05 [4:57 --> 4:57:31.935]: 
  I feel like this person is asking like what's an artistic looking tune with story and visuals to tell the story I think for a couple

 SPEAKER_06 [4:57:31.125 --> 4:57:50.565]: 
  I think for a comedy it doesn't have to look amazing. It just needs to fit the comedy style. Like South Park works perfectly well with the comedic pacing. Like the comedic pacing is snappy, you know, it's snappy. Wait, ask the question again. Which cartoon do you guys personally feel has the best balance of engaging story and visuals?

 SPEAKER_01 [4:57:41.520 --> 4:57:41.537]:

 SPEAKER_02 [4:59:09.810 --> 4:59:11.464]: 
  Это мови, вот, щет!

 SPEAKER_06 [4:59:11.532 --> 4:59:31.073]: 
  GreyGreySilver asks, you have been hired to create your own show. You have complete creative liberties. But your show must be in the 2-5 year old demographic. What would your show be about? Well that's a good one. You know, first of all, it is, but you know, I mean, I can't, okay, I'll let you guys answer because I'm not sure.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:59:23.327 --> 4:59:23.749]: 
  What would you do?

 SPEAKER_02 [4:59:24.677 --> 4:59:26.955]: 
  Well, that's a good one. That's a really good one.

 SPEAKER_01 [4:59:30.854 --> 4:59:34.937]: 
  I'd say multicolored, well I'm gonna call them tubbies because they're fat.

 SPEAKER_06 [4:59:34.937 --> 4:59:44.337]: 
  And they have little TVs in this... Oh, and like little... Teletopies! Dicks on their heads? They don't say that. I'm gonna make a show where it's like a group of guys all wearing... Is that a...

 SPEAKER_01 [4:59:37.350 --> 4:59:37.604]: 
  Oh no.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:59:44.084 --> 4:59:48.235]: 
  Is that a roundabout way of saying how can we make things that are socially acceptable or?

 SPEAKER_06 [4:59:48.117 --> 5:00:39.585]: 
  for two to five years, yeah I guess so. You have complete control I guess, but the audience is two to five years old. What would you possibly do a show about? Something with a lot of flashing colors, next question. Yeah, I wanna have a group of guys eating fruit loudly in front of the video, so you're watching. It's literally cool, it's a live-action video like four disgusting ovals. No, and they're not disgusting. Voting, food. Some are disgusting, but some are fit, and they're just eating food, chewing against the teeth. What fucks folks have a fruit that just dies? They also laugh at it, spit it through the teeth. That's what it is. I would do a, I would do a. They eat food and then they leave when it's done. Now the question is, this is for your own, because if it was just for the sake of money, I'd basically just create a Ray William Johnson show where I featured Minecraft Let's Players, and two to five year olds eat that shit up. That's a good idea. Oh no, I know, two to five years old.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:59:49.737 --> 4:59:50.024]: 
  So.

 SPEAKER_02 [4:59:56.925 --> 4:59:59.811]: 
  Something with a lot of flashing colors next

 SPEAKER_00 [5:00:04.705 --> 5:00:05.279]: 
  It's really澈

 SPEAKER_03 [5:00:09.531 --> 5:00:10.577]:

  Hello!

 SPEAKER_02 [5:00:36.531 --> 5:00:49.457]: 
  That's a good idea. Oh, that's a good idea. Oh, no, I know. Two to five years. It's a billion dollar industry. I think you're misconstruing what a five year old is. Oh, no. Here's what five year olds like. Yes. Oh, yes. I go beyond that. Next question.

 SPEAKER_04 [5:00:43.365 --> 5:00:46.437]: 
  Here's what five-year-olds like.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:00:46.437 --> 5:01:38.918]: 
  I go beyond that! It's my next question, guys! I'll tell you what, I wanted to write a kids book for a long time about a boy with a long pinky and the more of the story was, everyone called him a freak, especially his one kid class he made up of his long pinky but one day, that kid chokes on something It's a pinky! No, no, no, no, the boy chokes on food and he uses his pinky to dig it out? No, he points at it and laughs at it because he could use it to help him dig it and that's the moral, my friends Some of my filly, these are more like our cartoons than four-year-old jokes Is it a pop-up book with a pinky? You know what? So if I could honestly make a show for kids 2 to 5 this is what I would honestly do I would do a... the show would be whatever the normal length is and it would just be other kids from other countries I'm talking all over the world Saudi Arabia, China, Japan, everywhere and it's just other kids just playing That's it and that's what other kids would watch other kids do other kids from other countries playing

 SPEAKER_07 [5:01:13.504 --> 5:01:16.727]: 
  the author of that book with an foram

 SPEAKER_02 [5:01:36.674 --> 5:01:40.842]: 
  There's a little Saudi room kid at the end. So you're two of the kids in Kenya playing soccer?

 SPEAKER_06 [5:01:39.930 --> 5:01:51.017]: 
  Exactly, so you're sitting like there's these you know American kids watching television or they're in China or whatever And it's for their kids and they're watching other kids play how they would play

 SPEAKER_02 [5:01:46.630 --> 5:01:46.731]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:01:50.055 --> 5:01:59.100]:

I'm gonna die motherfucker. And go back to whatever I'm doing.

 SPEAKER_01 [5:03:24.285 --> 5:03:26.766]:

 SPEAKER_06 [5:04:12.059 --> 5:04:33.270]: 
  It's like spaghetti or something. They have to swim through the cold cooked spaghetti to get to the actual cooking together. Are you disqualified if you eat some of it as you go? If you eat it, you die in the old man's box. Yeah, it has core for a minute. In short, it has to fuck you. This is for a five-year-old? This is a Christmas show. So you have four-year-olds trying to eat it and fucking suffocating in the soup for you. They take the spatula and whack you.

  I give him tips.

 SPEAKER_07 [5:07:45.443 --> 5:07:47.738]: 
  Glory. Take them that same amount of time to see the level.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:07:51.231 --> 5:07:55.450]: 
  Yeah, I put in the envelopes with the obisis hits him right in the face and he

 SPEAKER_02 [5:07:55.450 --> 5:08:07.127]: 
  would be a bullet list it would say number one don't trust women number two learn how to cook number three do you know how to change a tire you need to it would just go down like that it would just be like life knowledge

 SPEAKER_00 [5:08:06.705 --> 5:08:07.499]: 
  I think he got a dissapointing.

 SPEAKER_04 [5:08:07.127 --> 5:08:09.507]: 
  This is all the shit that you tell yourself now, though.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:08:07.499 --> 5:08:08.528]: 
  This is all the shit that you take.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:08:09.507 --> 5:08:18.450]: 
  You don't need to send a letter to yours past. You just do it right now. I know, but I know that already. Oh, I see. So you wouldn't have to deal with all that. Now listen, if you didn't get a letter- I left over the coals.

 SPEAKER_00 [5:08:13.624 --> 5:08:15.278]: 
  Oh, I see, so you wouldn't have to...

 SPEAKER_06 [5:08:18.450 --> 5:08:25.909]: 
  But if you got that letter, it's like that parent thing where the parents try to give you advice like you should brush your teeth and floss your teeth so you don't pull out.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:08:24.390 --> 5:08:27.495]: 
  lost your teeth so you don't pull out, blah blah blah.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:08:27.495 --> 5:08:39.004]: 
  It takes you experiencing it for you to actually let it sink in. Right. So if you got a letter from a girlfriend and a husband. Right. So if you got a letter from yourself telling you to do all of these things, wouldn't you just read letter and be like, yeah, fuck you. So what you need is to go.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:08:31.056 --> 5:08:31.950]: 
  Right.

 SPEAKER_03 [5:08:31.073 --> 5:08:33.233]: 
  Right, so you got a girlfriend and...

 SPEAKER_02 [5:08:38.245 --> 5:08:50.952]: 
  So what you need to do is give them something cryptic that they could actually figure out like you can't give them blunt knowledge Yeah, yeah, I have a realistic advice because nobody's ever gonna take that Yeah, so you have to give them a puzzle piece to figure out later that are a cam if I saw my face

 SPEAKER_03 [5:08:43.560 --> 5:08:44.759]: 
  Yeah, I have a serious

 SPEAKER_06 [5:08:43.982 --> 5:08:44.438]: 
  I was

 SPEAKER_06 [5:08:50.952 --> 5:09:24.921]: 
  telling me that I probably believe it. I've got the letter. I have a serious question. If you were to case a fart in a container and send it back to him, would it smell? You mean like an abolj jar? No, it's going back in time. Is it like a box close? Absolutely, it would still smell. It's not like you can come in a jar, send it back, and then it gets sucked back into your dick. How do you know? Well, you're right. Oh, so like the fumes are dissipating in the future. No, this is the past. Alright, so. So, if you fart and go in the past. I'll tell you what, Collie. Because only certain particles can exist in a universe, so it sucks as far as someone else's ass. You'd kill someone else, Collie. You'd deprive it of the fart. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [5:08:52.943 --> 5:08:53.955]: 
  I've got the letters.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:08:58.799 --> 5:09:00.250]: 
  You mean like in a ball jar?

 SPEAKER_02 [5:09:09.447 --> 5:09:12.653]: 
  Oh, so like the fumes are dissipating in the future.

 SPEAKER_03 [5:09:14.492 --> 5:09:14.712]: 
  So.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:09:24.550 --> 5:09:32.937]: 
  I don't think anyone's figured that out yet because if you're intelligent enough to create time travel The first thing you're gonna do is not

 SPEAKER_06 [5:09:31.215 --> 5:09:31.992]: 
  पुर्ड़।

 SPEAKER_01 [5:09:31.992 --> 5:09:35.940]: 
  And then hope that he goes back to... You don't know me, bro.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:09:35.940 --> 5:09:48.782]: 
  very well.

 SPEAKER_01 [5:09:42.690 --> 5:09:43.855]: 
  smell they said it back

 SPEAKER_01 [5:09:46.032 --> 5:09:46.909]: 
 谢谢

 SPEAKER_01 [5:09:48.782 --> 5:09:53.018]: 
  He's one of the best, come on, does he? Ya! Now you have a cover in $2US!

 SPEAKER_02 [5:09:51.719 --> 5:09:55.110]: 
  Put a note on the top, it says don't open until right now.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:09:55.836 --> 5:10:12.762]: 
  Open immediately. No, but I mean like it sounds like I'm being like silly, but no, I'm actually serious. Like, technically would it be a fresh fart or would it be a fart that's like, you know, it's because of the right? It doesn't exist yet. I feel like if you send it anything back in time. Oh yeah, the fart didn't exist yet. Yeah, technically.

 SPEAKER_01 [5:10:07.294 --> 5:10:07.497]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:10:07.497 --> 5:10:08.037]: 
  out of the way.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:10:10.517 --> 5:10:15.951]: 
  Oh yeah, the fart didn't exist yet. So maybe they opened the box and it's not even in there. Yeah, I know what it is.

 SPEAKER_00 [5:10:11.445 --> 5:10:11.952]: 
  exists yet.

 SPEAKER_01 [5:10:14.837 --> 5:10:22.634]: 
  Yeah, it was a better one than the box one. Yeah, but the letter would be the other. What are you fucking up to? Are you looking at a picture of your fucking wallet and says, fade away, call and you gotta go back and save it?

 SPEAKER_06 [5:10:15.951 --> 5:10:18.449]: 
  The letter wouldn't be in the box would be there.

A refrigerator, a computer, like just be like, I know what that is, I know what that is. Yeah, I was really into robotics at the time, I wish I kind of would like to. I still should. That's something I should fight and do with robots. And little inventions that did nothing. Like, I'd take apart a VCR and a wealth of... Cooking, mechanics, and building a computer. Like, how computers work and how you can like, fix a computer and make a computer. You're just stolen by building a computer.

 SPEAKER_04 [5:28:02.367 --> 5:28:03.059]: 
  I guess

 SPEAKER_04 [5:28:03.767 --> 5:28:05.944]: 
  Programming or like survival in the world?

 SPEAKER_03 [5:28:12.863 --> 5:28:15.934]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's why I drew two.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:28:17.318 --> 5:28:17.470]:

 SPEAKER_02 [5:28:19.562 --> 5:28:21.992]: 
  I still should. That's something that you fight to do.

 SPEAKER_07 [5:28:21.992 --> 5:28:25.570]: 
  And little inventions that did nothing like I take apart a VCR

 SPEAKER_02 [5:28:30.987 --> 5:28:36.083]: 
  You just stole my computer. Your building a computer is not that fucking complicated. Yeah, I just felt like- It fucking is for me. I never learned.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:28:32.995 --> 5:28:48.992]: 
  complicated.

 SPEAKER_03 [5:28:36.083 --> 5:28:36.150]:

 SPEAKER_02 [5:28:48.992 --> 5:28:56.046]: 
  If you open anything up, I bet you can look at it and everything, a lot, I wouldn't say everything but most of it would be common sense.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:28:55.962 --> 5:28:59.944]: 
  Well, I'd like to get that confidence to know that I can just reach in and pull something out knowing

 SPEAKER_02 [5:28:59.944 --> 5:29:04.197]: 
  You can do whatever the fuck you want to do. Break up, break this TV open and see what happens.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:29:03.269 --> 5:29:33.390]: 
  See what happens. Yeah, fuck it up and rip a cord by accident when I'm freaking out trying to pull something lightly All right guys, we got two last questions for our lightning round We're gonna wrap this up the first one. What was your favorite podcast you guys have made that so far? That's a good one. Yeah, I really it's a tie right? I really really enjoyed the pilot with the stamper Jeff what I did. I really enjoyed the rogue figure Yeah, that's almost I really enjoyed The pornography hour which is up to 10. I thought that was a really good one The hospital what I enjoyed and I think

 SPEAKER_02 [5:29:08.550 --> 5:29:09.006]: 
  All right guys.

 SPEAKER_05 [5:29:16.684 --> 5:29:18.051]:

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [5:29:33.525 --> 5:29:35.078]: 
  I don't like the hospital one at all.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:29:35.078 --> 5:29:52.020]: 
  I liked it because it had a story to it. I think the story ones are always a good change of pace like the Sabrina one It's what Sabrina was a good highlight one. You're naming loads. I'm just trying to know what I'm trying to think of them first Yeah, how many fucking voice voice feels with Jesus. I like I like there's segments on my own

 SPEAKER_02 [5:29:46.030 --> 5:29:47.970]: 
  Yeah, there's so many fucking...

 SPEAKER_02 [5:29:49.304 --> 5:29:54.906]: 
  My overall favorite podcast yeah, that was fun. You don't have to be

 SPEAKER_06 [5:29:53.843 --> 5:29:58.230]: 
  You don't have to be in the world. The world figure is a cheaty. I feel like it's a cheat. It's a... The voice spills with Jesus was one of the first ones.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:29:56.442 --> 5:29:56.931]: 
  It's a-

 SPEAKER_05 [5:29:58.230 --> 5:30:04.947]: 
  My very favorite overall podcast I wasn't in it. It's the Shad one. That was like the number one Shooks was a great one. Shooks was a good one.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:30:02.685 --> 5:30:08.355]: 
  That was a great show. That was a good one. I can't tell you the entire radio though, so I didn't... I added it.

 SPEAKER_00 [5:30:04.947 --> 5:30:07.005]: 
  I can't tell you guys really though, so I didn't...

 SPEAKER_02 [5:30:07.005 --> 5:30:13.992]: 
  I have been I edited I'd like loved editing though. I have a special place for the any anyone that we talked about like paranormal things Oh, yeah

 SPEAKER_04 [5:30:08.355 --> 5:30:08.524]: 
  like

 SPEAKER_07 [5:30:13.232 --> 5:30:15.949]: 
  Oh yeah, in the first game.

 SPEAKER_04 [5:30:13.992 --> 5:30:19.105]: 
  Like episode four like the ghost of grandma's janitor

 SPEAKER_02 [5:30:15.949 --> 5:30:16.017]:

  you

 SPEAKER_01 [5:30:17.755 --> 5:30:31.710]: 
  There's something really sp- like I would almost say that was my favorite episode. Yeah, absolutely. I still think that's one of the stories. I still love episode 5, The Roadfinger. I do like, obviously I like episode 1. Yeah, yeah. Or the pilot.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:30:22.395 --> 5:30:25.214]: 
  Yeah, that's a good one. I still think that's one of the things.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:30:27.559 --> 5:30:28.032]: 
  I do like

 SPEAKER_06 [5:30:29.635 --> 5:30:50.509]: 
  Yeah, yeah, or the pilot would be able to. I would love, love, love either to do a live-action version or see an animated version of that whole skit with like Jeff and Corey and you guys when it was the ghost, when it was the ghost detective guy and he's all like, the ghost tells him to go fuck his death line for the grave. That was absurd, that was absurd, what I think. Was it really? Yeah, yeah, well after the pilot, it was.

 SPEAKER_04 [5:30:44.704 --> 5:30:46.088]: 
  the life with him.

 SPEAKER_04 [5:30:46.814 --> 5:30:46.915]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [5:30:46.915 --> 5:30:48.417]: 
  Was it really? Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:30:50.222 --> 5:30:56.415]: 
  I just feel like it's relatable. It's like it's intangible things that we're all talking about and I feel like everyone can relate to like

 SPEAKER_06 [5:30:56.483 --> 5:31:32.190]: 
  I think I have but I have always feel like the product for hours really not under really but I think it's not pretty I really enjoy that one a lot. I had a lot of funny stuff. Yeah, cuz ever we were all moving We don't really out of it. We're like that we came and do it this week We did it. I remember really walking out of that one if we go, okay, that was a good one We you know, I don't know what about you guys. What do you think? Yeah? I like some last episodes to Let's say let's say it upon this favorite last episode People hate Paul Red. Yeah, I Like the one the first one we did Coming up and like great just putting his hand in yours. The only reason

 SPEAKER_04 [5:31:01.495 --> 5:31:03.047]:

 SPEAKER_01 [5:31:02.980 --> 5:31:03.014]: 
  MBC 뉴스 이덕영입니다.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:31:23.027 --> 5:31:29.288]: 
  I like the ball rod one. The ball rod was the first one we did. I love that one, the whole idea with the spaghetti.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:31:31.499 --> 5:31:37.118]: 
  The only reason Paul Rudd existed was because we recorded that initially with the first thing.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:31:35.903 --> 5:31]: 
  That was, yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [5:31 --> 5:31:38.046]: 
  We just cut it out because we've

 SPEAKER_02 [5:31:38.046 --> 5:31:39.497]: 
  felt it wasn't good enough.

 SPEAKER_01 [5:31:39.497 --> 5:31:40.729]: 
  was a quote unquote lost.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:31:40.442 --> 5:31:41.219]: 
 下集見

 SPEAKER_06 [5:31:40.729 --> 5:31:52.997]: 
  I love some of those jokes. And you guys kept bringing it back, which is so great. Because it was very like, even when you guys trailed off, then it was like, what do you think his favorite flavor would be? Like, blood? Like, just like this muddy water or whatever?

 SPEAKER_02 [5:31:51.445 --> 5:31:51.462]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [5:31:52.997 --> 5:32:04.439]: 
  It is kind of dangerous though because like not many people know who Paul Rudd is by people who do like it probably so it's like I did like the drunken idiocy out that's what I'm gonna say yeah

 SPEAKER_07 [5:31:58.650 --> 5:32:00.962]: 
  people who do like it probably so it's like

 SPEAKER_01 [5:32:03.392 --> 5:32:07.949]: 
  That's what I was gonna say, yeah. Mainly because I was just hanging out with Corey and Nile and we were just having a good time.

 SPEAKER_07 [5:32:03.949 --> 5:32:04.827]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [5:32:07.712 --> 5:32:11.442]:

  I was like that wasn't even a tabby I also really liked the green M&M I listened to the green M&M like 8 fucking times The green M&M was good

 SPEAKER_03 [5:32:11.442 --> 5:32:12.994]: 
  I heard it was

 SPEAKER_02 [5:32:12.994 --> 5:32:14.918]: 
  I listened to the green M&M like 8

 SPEAKER_02 [5:32:15.728 --> 5:32:20.183]: 
  The green M&M is good. Later on I found out the brown M&M was way hotter. She is way hotter.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:32:19.035 --> 5:32:27.507]: 
  She is way hotter, but the thing is I didn't even fucking know about her green eminem Green eminem is fucking everywhere the brown eminem is trying to show up. She's fucking hot bitch. What the lens?

 SPEAKER_02 [5:32:22.225 --> 5:32:22.242]:

  and got those nice frames.

 SPEAKER_07 [5:32:29.059 --> 5:32:37.058]: 
  She's a librarian dude fucking creepy, but anyway my worst one definitely is the tinder update because that spawned a lot of bullshit

 SPEAKER_06 [5:32:36.231 --> 5:32:39.792]: 
  We weren't asking about worst and that was one of my favorite too.

 SPEAKER_03 [5:32:37.699 --> 5:32:37.868]: 
  and that's it.

 SPEAKER_07 [5:32:37.868 --> 5:32:38.948]: 
  That was actually one of my...

 SPEAKER_01 [5:32:38.948 --> 5:32:42.492]: 
  favorite to I just wanted to say I just found a lot of very last question

 SPEAKER_06 [5:32:41.091 --> 5:32:44.500]: 
  Very last question guys. Who's fault is that? Captain Tender?

 SPEAKER_02 [5:32:42.492 --> 5:32:42.981]: 
  What is that?

 SPEAKER_07 [5:32:42.981 --> 5:32:47.993]: 
  Captain Tender? He has Chris. What's your business? It was a deal I made with Jeff because he picked me up. I had to do it.

 SPEAKER_05 [5:32:47.419 --> 5:32:52.178]: 
  My hands you said I like the hospital one of the pornography one. Yeah, yeah.

  Yeah, your last question. There we go Zerg says asks actually spaghetti birds one

 SPEAKER_03 [5:32:52.094 --> 5:32]: 
  For your last question, here we go.

 SPEAKER_05 [5:32:53.005 --> 5:32:56.110]: 
  There we go. Zerg says,

 SPEAKER_02 [5:33:00.143 --> 5:33:03.839]: 
  Why is there a season finale to a fucking podcast?

 SPEAKER_06 [5:33:05.357 --> 5:33:21.794]: 
  That's a good question. That's what I wanted to say. Why is there a finale? Well, let me tell you something. It all comes down to we need time to prepare. We need to take a break. We've been doing this every single fucking week. But...

 SPEAKER_04 [5:33:08.462 --> 5:33:09.542]: 
  I wanna save it for later.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:33:17.001 --> 5:33:17.997]: 
  Take a break.

 SPEAKER_03 [5:33:17.727 --> 5:33:17.744]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [5:33:17.997 --> 5:33:18.469]: 
  You can take a break.

 SPEAKER_01 [5:33:21.794 --> 5:33:22.502]: 
  There is

 SPEAKER_02 [5:33:22.502 --> 5:33:26.940]: 
  in unlimited amount of factors there. Look at your favorite TV show.

 SPEAKER_01 [5:33:26.940 --> 5:33:31.311]: 
  Yeah, when did it start running into the ground? Yeah, exactly

 SPEAKER_03 [5:33:27.261 --> 5:33:27.582]: 
  deal.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:33:31.109 --> 5:33:36.120]: 
  You need to quit when you're ahead and regroup or quit entirely. Also, let me just be honest. Let me be honest.

 SPEAKER_05 [5:33:34.585 --> 5:33:42.921]: 
  Also, let me just be honest. Let me be honest. Like if we said we're just taking a big break for three months Never called a season people would be much more upset, but if we say season two people

 SPEAKER_02 [5:33:41.976 --> 5:33:46.937]: 
  Nobody wants to hear somebody going on and on and on for years. What did, I know it's kind of a corny reference.

 SPEAKER_04 [5:33:46.937 --> 5:33:50.937]: 
  But what did the Goblin say in the first Spider-Man movie?

 SPEAKER_01 [5:33:50.937 --> 5:33:54.717]: 
  That was all people. Are you in or are you out? No. Was it?

 SPEAKER_06 [5:33:53.434 --> 5:33:56.792]: 
  No What is it? I think you're thinking of Joker for Batman dude

 SPEAKER_01 [5:33:56.708 --> 5:34:01.939]: 
  No, I'm thinking of the time where he said um the only thing people like more than holding something

 SPEAKER_02 [5:34:01.939 --> 5:34:05.432]: 
  something up is to break them down. Yeah. To watch them fail.

 SPEAKER_01 [5:34:03.779 --> 5:34:06.799]: 
  Yeah, to watch them fail. Keep them up, building people up, and then breaking them down.

 SPEAKER_05 [5:34:04.994 --> 5:34:09.803]: 
  I love building people up and then breaking them down when they're at the top. That's like a celebrity thing, you know? It's like...

 SPEAKER_02 [5:34:08.875 --> 5:34:13.380]: 
  It's also done. You support them all the way up and then you get sick of them and then back.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:34:12.672 --> 5:34:33.951]: 
  Like Aristotle said something like that, but I like that you associate that quote with What's that famous fucking Batman co-p either you either live long enough what is it? You get busy living or get busy dying

 SPEAKER_01 [5:34:17.684 --> 5:34:19.945]: 
  Well nobody else has said it better like

 SPEAKER_07 [5:34:27.505 --> 5:34:30.492]: 
  He lives along in my shot. As I drive and

 SPEAKER_00 [5:34:32.500 --> 5:34:38.895]: 
  There's a snake in my boot. You die here or live longer, just live longer. There'll be a villain, yeah.

 SPEAKER_07 [5:34:36.516 --> 5:34:41.089]: 
  It's a vlog of feeling, yeah. It's a bit of a vlog. I think it's kind of like... Very nice, how much? Ha ha ha!

 SPEAKER_02 [5:34:41.089 --> 5:34:43.992]: 
  Another quote is every fucking sea

 SPEAKER_01 [5:34:43.992 --> 5:34:46.455]: 
  and gets worse and worse as it goes on. Yes.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:34:45.949 --> 5:34:59.601]: 
  Yeah, so we're just gonna try to regroup and figure out how to do these better. We're gonna get some guys in, run PR meetings, see what the kids are talking about. Yeah, we're gonna get some stats, we're gonna get some stats from the kids, from the demographics.

 SPEAKER_01 [5:34:49.999 --> 5:34:50.303]: 
  We're gonna

 SPEAKER_00 [5:34:50.303 --> 5:34:51.130]: 
  Get some guys in.

 SPEAKER_03 [5:34:53.526 --> 5:34:54.960]: 
  Yeah, we're gonna get some

 SPEAKER_03 [5:34:57.829 --> 5:34:58.909]: 
  On the G immer Write

 SPEAKER_02 [5:34:58.909 --> 5:35:11.684]: 
  From my perspective, I think that we were doing things just fine, but at the same time, you know You can do this better though Most definitely, but I will say that a lot of us are eating up time with this that we could be You know, there's a lot of

 SPEAKER_01 [5:34:59.601 --> 5:34:59.618]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [5:35:04.495 --> 5:35:04.950]: 
  perdón

 SPEAKER_01 [5:35:10.502 --> 5:35:14.940]: 
  could be, you know, there's a lot of people that want content from us as well. And this is a

 SPEAKER_02 [5:35:13.827 --> 5:35:17.016]: 
  This is a weekly thing that we have to keep doing.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:35:16.628 --> 5:35:41.940]: 
  The important thing too is like if we get a patreon we did that if we didn't have all these different Responsibilities we wouldn't be taking a break, but the truth is that we now you know We owe people something back and you know they deserve that it now needs to be looked at a lot more carefully and For a lot more we were pretty effort to do before but we were pretty as much as we needed to now We need to do this better and also do more content better

 SPEAKER_07 [5:35:41.940 --> 5:35:43.004]: 
  We did meetings in a-

 SPEAKER_05 [5:35:43.004 --> 5:35:49.703]: 
  But there was no like sitting down and actually like as a company it's like we're gonna do like we're gonna make skid just didn't have time

 SPEAKER_06 [5:35:48.134 --> 5:35:54.445]: 
  time. We have it, we release an episode and then we have to do another episode. The podcast started as...

 SPEAKER_01 [5:35:54.445 --> 5:36:01.499]: 
  a piece of content that we could put out. Exactly. So if nothing else, at least people could stay in touch with us and... Because...

 SPEAKER_03 [5:35:56.942 --> 5:35:57.195]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:36:01.499 --> 5:36:20.415]: 
  This was the point where we would do a cartoon and then seven was later We do update video and it's up with sling to a cartoon I think we were all just you know as an animator that just gets sick of you like you constantly you you want it You have this orange. We're all content creators We just want to give people stop and create pretty much We're all constantly trying to give and you can't give when you're working people have shitty lives

 SPEAKER_01 [5:36:19.504 --> 5:36:27.807]: 
  I think I have shitty lives man. I would love to make someone smile after their day of car pushing at Walmart. Cause I get it, I understand. Fucking sucked.

 SPEAKER_02 [5:36:27.452 --> 5:36:28.650]: 
  I can make you laugh.

 SPEAKER_06 [5:36:27.807 --> 5:37:27.949]: 
  But the easiest thing to do is just sit in a room and talk and release that a week. But it's also taxing because it's like it's not even a factor of I want to do this. It's a factor of we need to do this now. It's an obligation. And by the way, we need to be good at it. We can't we show we can just come here and go. Okay, anyways, let's talk about what's the biggest shit you ever saw. Okay, exactly. We can't we're trying to be want to keep it fresh and keep it good and keep it it get better and everywhere we need to because you know, we don't want to plateau because I don't I don't believe there's any such thing as plateauing. I feel like the second you get comfortable is the second you get bad. There's you can't there's no such thing as entertainment as sticky at a certain level. You either keep getting better or you get worse. So that's the only two options. I think. Yeah. And so for that, let's there's a lot of fairness there. Let's let's close close up. You could wrap it up with your favorite song. Rain drops. No. Rain drops falling from my head. No, I'm silly. No. I don't know the rest of the words.

 SPEAKER_04 [5:36:45.745 --> 5:36:46.386]: 
  Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_05 [5:37:14.483 --> 5:37:14.669]: 
  What

 SPEAKER_03 [5:37:14.669 --> 5:37:15.715]: 
  raindrops

 SPEAKER_01 [5:37:15.445 --> 5:37:16.019]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_01 [5:37 --> 5:37:30.497]:
