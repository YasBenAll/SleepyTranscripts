 SPEAKER_00 [0:00:00.497 --> 0:00:20.444]: 
  There is a world as tangible as our own, impossible to see yet unavoidable to sense.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:00:20.444 --> 0:00:23.565]: 
  It's a bunch of guys, it's a bunch of bullshitter.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:23.245 --> 0:00:42.330]:

  and of course our special guest. Challenge your approaching.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:39.985 --> 0:00:40.255]: 
  say hello.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:41.504 --> 0:00:44.490]: 
  That's sad. Lovely to have you back on our podcast.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:44.001 --> 0:00:50.380]: 
  Thank you for having me. Yeah, why were you so excited to be on the show you've been talking about it all month? I don't know what you're talking about

 SPEAKER_03 [0:00:51.392 --> 0:02:15.700]: 
  This is so spontaneous. Make literally a butt. It's just that today. It's true. Enough of the formalities. I want to talk about topics. Let's do it. Here's something I discussed with Jeff and stuff. It was kind of funny. We were at Outback and we were like, you know, these new age abduction tactics won't work anymore. Like kids, kids are, they've grown out of the whole way. They've gotten savvy. They've gotten smarter. They've gotten internet savvy. You can't go up to a kid and be like, I got candy for you. And be like, I can get candy on the internet for like $10. So it's like, I saw videos of that. They're like, they get out their phones. They're like, stranger, danger. Yeah, yeah. It's, it's a different age now where it's like, how would you lure kids into your, you know, supposive ice cream truck? You no longer can use the candy place. It's true. I'll tell you one thing that's really put a wrench in my bucket. I mean, not me. I'm not like, you know, I'm not picking up kids or anything. Excuse me. A wrench in your bucket. One thing I will say is like phone tracking. I know has to be a factor. The fact that, you know, all kids have cell phones now. So if they ever got abducted, you know, just where's my iPhone app? Yeah. Done. There's my kid. I'm like, where's my rapage? Yeah. Where's my rape child app? Yeah. Where's my rape child app? No, the other thing is like so many times they're always like tweeting their location and like photos and stuff like that. Like if they were going to get in a car somewhere, they could, you know, they're probably just snapping photos of it and tweeting it or Instagramming it anyway. So what, what do you have to do? What does a guy or girl have to do to properly abduct and molest a child nowadays? What does the world come to? And or molest. I don't want to jump to conclusions. Right. Sorry. Okay.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:52.017 --> 0:00:55.324]: 
  on Danny's YouTube set today. It's true. It's enough of the four minutes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:00:57.501 --> 0:00:58.244]: 
  Let's do it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:01:33.293 --> 0:01:35.993]: 
  Like, you know, I'm not picking up kids or anything.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:49.864 --> 0:01:49.932]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:01:51.146 --> 0:01:53.070]: 
  Yeah, where's my rate child at? No, it won't work.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:10.485 --> 0:02:11.447]: 
  What is the world?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:12.899 --> 0:02:14.130]: 
  I'm sorry. Right.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:02:16.628 --> 0:03:10.847]: 
  So why are we asking you this? Were there tactics you were thinking of here? So you have to be smart now. You can't, you know, candy and all that shit. It's not going to work more. So you got to really like look it up. Like, where are the kids into? Right. The Angry Birds Minecraft. Right. So you got to be like. I got some Angry Birds over here getting my car. No, no. You got to be like, I got an Angry Birds Minecraft. You know the Angry Birds movie? I have the first ever showing in my car on paper views. That's not even fair. I feel like right now you're giving out some actual advice right now. You tell them, you're like, I know a new Minecraft ingredient on how to craft kryptonite. And people are like, well, that's cool. Then you bite them in. You got an envelope of Minecraft. That was beat. Beating them down. Oh, that was beady. I wasn't sure what that was. No, no. And then I take them out. Munching your hand. I was sure if that was like vicious rabbit ass pounding or if you were smacking their face. No, I take them out. And then I scold them on my prank channel. And I'm like, listen.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:17.235 --> 0:02:19.480]: 
  So okay, so like so you were thinking of here

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:25.639 --> 0:02:25.875]: 
  Right.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:27.495 --> 0:02:28.947]: 
  Right. So you're a kid. Like, I'm not.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:34.347 --> 0:02:35.494]: 
  You know the anger words movie?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:38.177 --> 0:02:39.899]: 
  That's not even fair.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:43.645 --> 0:02:44.607]: 
  Can you tell him?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:55.677 --> 0:02:56.436]: 
  That was B.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:59.423 --> 0:02:59.946]: 
  No, no.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:02:59.946 --> 0:03:02.325]: 
  and then I take them out. I'm pinching your hand. I wasn't sure if that was like.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:11.759 --> 0:03:35.451]: 
  I think another way to do it though would be like in game probably like to have like an in game persona You know what I mean like in a second life scenario because I feel like that's the quickest way at least to to connect with them on a level Especially if you can fake your identity second life or whatever like second life Sims stuff like that say something Anyone's Facebook People actually use it for that. Oh, yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:25.917 --> 0:03:27.132]: 
  your identity.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:30.237 --> 0:03:31.452]: 
  I don't think anyone's

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:34.135 --> 0:03:36.784]: 
  Oh yeah, no. They use it to hook up with children. Me, I don't...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:36.109 --> 0:09:23.481]: 
  I don't think anyone's going to your Sims 3 server No, what am I talking about? You're talking about Sims and second I fucked that they're just going right to the Minecraft server They're going to the source. Yeah, they're going to your place to going like oh I really like this slide you made a Minecraft and this yeah mining tunnel compliment That's like step one get on the server step to compliment their creations. Yeah step four give them mod abilities So they feel important right step five. Oh, yeah dress Yeah to meet up I have this special Minecraft ingredient, but I have to give it to you in person Let's see the key to Minecraft Take about place we found on second life where you go in and there's like all these children kind of in cages Oh, what isn't that the baby sanctuary? Yeah, the baby sanctuary That place is fucking creepy. No you go in and there's babies in cages But they've got like ladies voicing them so they're like I can't find my parents So it may give you more to adopt them What but people can actually plays them to you used to be able to go in there right? It's just like a creepy mod. No, I don't know it's part of the game second life Just is a creepy mod you can do whatever you want in it second life It's like it's like a script heavy game where you can create your own matches you can put your own animations Yeah, sometimes the scripts are kind of like they work against it because they used to be a script where you can kick the babies and stuff Yeah, people would just go in there like to adoption centers and start kicking kids Oh Babies aren't real characters. They're in peace. They can be it's weird They can you can get an NPC or a real person who will pose as a baby for you. You spent up to 88 There's people who dress up in diapers naked and like roll around on the floor and that turns them on It's shit themselves in real life. It's not second life second life. That's harmless. That's real Yeah, but but if you were to adopt a person posing as a baby, there's clearly something weird going on in some way I think your baby has a person talking, right? Yeah, so what you're having conversations with this baby Like why are you seeking out a baby companion? It's not like now you're my daddy. Yes, you are my child Yes, there is no people like roleplay just be a baby Yeah, so you can own land in second life and what people always strive to do for some reason is have a family within second life So it's like this is my wife and this is my son and it like you know They're a little baby boy in the game might be a big fat 50 year old bearded man in real life Who's just like I love you father and they'll just roleplay that for fucking weeks and weeks You know, you know when I played second life, it was a lot more innocent, you know, no It wasn't there was no chat. There was no talking option. You just typed you you put your fucking smooches and coos You didn't actually I love you Someone making out with a baby like a girl No, I'm pretty sure in real life. I'm pretty sure Bans you for doing I've seen I went to I went to we went to the baby changing server where a bunch of people were changing babies That's pretty weird. What you mean changing their diapers or swapping babies Well, you you you walk up to the babies No, there's this long novel of words that talks about a story of you digging your heads into their fucking diaper and feeling But you could have a person being like change my diaper papa My wiener I've heard that people poses like real estate agents or something. They don't poses them They are real. Yeah, and then they're selling like this digital second-life real estate for real cash Yeah, and they used to make shit tons of money doing it You know, I saw like a documentary on this like fat obese black woman who designed furniture in second-life Yeah, and she looked fucked but she was happy because she was doing what she loves Well, yeah, she was having a good old time, but she looked really bad like this worse than Do you think that when those people like know they're going to die in their real life that they would have like a funeral on second life? Probably I don't think anyone would do it for them. No, no show up because people are really self-absorbed in second life All anybody wants to do is brag about themselves. Nobody cares about anyone Yeah, people would come to your server and suck griefing when you have in your fucking Funny thing about those babies though is that like you'll adopt them and then they'll still be like Where's my parents they don't change the voices or anything? Do they really? Yeah Doesn't it go with a happy script or something like I think so I'm not at the skill level Chris is where you can like He's like a good sheep herding dog. He knows how to hurt them in that. Do they have like a sin? Do they have second-life cons? I don't think so no because that would just ruin the whole Facade and they have for Katie. Oh, yeah. Do people dress as their avatars? No, I've never heard of for Katie Khan Big life Dad and I had a brief discussion earlier today, and I'm curious. It's a little scientific science. Don't worry I think you'll be okay. Shut up. Are you ignorant shit? Please go on all right. This ruffian so we were discussing the idea of artificial intelligence Oh, yeah, and shut up. We're discussing artificial intelligence and what the implications of that would be yeah, right? Now we always see artificial intelligence is like in the movies It's like oh they start getting really sad that they're robots and they don't want to die They're gonna kill you and then they want to kill everybody else essentially Yeah, that's what we end up seeing But I was curious if a robot had free will like complete free will and Imagination to think if a robot could come to the conclusion that there may be a God because eventually There's a point where the logic ends right? There's only so many things we know like we still don't know what the beginning of the universe is Eventually you'd hit a wall and if you had free will to have imagination to think for yourself Could you not possibly make the leap to think that there was something beyond logic right? Yeah, they probably like in a split second come up with the most crazy fucking backstory monster Make ever seen the video where this like robot with four legs is walking on a treadmill And I throw a log at it

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:40.800 --> 0:03:42.522]: 
  No, what am I talking about? You're talking about...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:46.167 --> 0:03:46.825]:

  Yeah, the baby sanctuary, going in.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:31.847 --> 0:04:33.045]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:17.029 --> 0:06:19.155]: 
  In Second Life or Real Life?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:21.366 --> 0:06:22.547]:

  probably

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:22.049 --> 0:07:22.622]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:27.735 --> 0:07:29.069]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:41.168 --> 0:07:43.952]: 
  Excuse me? Does it come with you?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:55.849 --> 0:07:56.288]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:57.722 --> 0:07:59.005]: 
  The whole facade.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:07:59.005 --> 0:08:01.097]: 
  and they have percadium, huh? Oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:05.974 --> 0:08:08.404]: 
  Why? It's because I made it up. Oh, fucking ass. Yeah, didn't I?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:39.437 --> 0:08:40.230]: 
  I'm gonna kill you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:15.482 --> 0:09:15.499]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:15.499 --> 0:09:16.124]: 
  Thanks so much!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:21.507 --> 0:09:22.620]: 
  Candi農

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:26.299 --> 0:09:26.620]: 
  That's a...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:26.451 --> 0:09:27.936]: 
  What support do you guys got?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:27.936 --> 0:12:42.944]: 
  Let's say learn how to dodge the wood. Shut up. I saw one where they had a robot. You could shove it and it could counterbalance. Yeah, it was the same one. They threw wood at it until it learned how to jump over it. Then they started pushing it off the treadmill and then it learned to keep its weight on. I love that's what you got to in that. You're talking about philosophical things. If that robot... If it ever became self-aware and looked back at that footage, it would look back and be like, you guys are assholes sitting there fucking shoving me around. They justified it. They'd be like, hey, baby steps. We had to push you down in the dirt. Yeah, but then they would study and see if that's what we do to our younglings. It is what we do. We shove our babies down and fucking wait for them to get up and push them down again until they finally learn balance. That is what we do. We don't do that. No, I think in a lot of ways we do. We like set people up to fail so we can see them figure out how to do that. Sometimes you just gotta fucking bully and beat the shit out of someone until they're not lame anymore. If you have a lame kid, push it down until they learn how to do that. People need to learn that being lame is something that you can physically extract from people. If you hit them enough, they will stop being lame. What you just said, that was all nonsense. What? It's complete gibberish. You beat the lame out of people. It's just nonsense. To a degree. It's a moley metaphor. Yeah, we were talking. What if there's this guy who's like, yeah, I'm pretty cool. I go to Katana and he's there swinging at you. But he's like the fat old workout. You fucking kick him till he's down and you take the Katana away and you make him learn his lesson. Do you not think- Yeah, do you not honestly think that if people are acting stupid, if you shoot them down and point out their flaws, that they will not possibly learn from that and become less lame? Here's the thing. So in some ways you could argue that yes, you can beat the lame out of it. No, no, on a very serious note, obviously that's fucking around, but on a serious note, I do think that all of the best lessons I learned came from me fucking up really hard and people pointing it out. Oh, no, absolutely. But some kids and stuff who you perceive as to be lame, that's just them, that's just the way they are and they don't really deserve it. I'm not saying you just walk up to a bunch of kids playing cards against humanity and just fucking take a baseball bat to the back of their head. I'm just saying that, you know, in terms of certain flaws- I'm talking about a guy who walks into your office and spills coffee all over his pants and fucking wipes it off on your desk. Yeah. You gotta be like, dude, you're fucking 80 and you punch it down to the ground. Or you just let him do it because then he's just gonna keep doing it. He's gonna keep pouring coffee all over his lap. And fucking wiping it all over your face. Yeah. Fucking asshole. What you see, Shad? It's the only way. Like that girl who poured beer on her pants and rubbed it in. What? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? She poured beer on her pants and then she rubbed her pussy in the house face. Oh, fuck. Oh, yeah, that's a mystery lady. What the fuck? Well, it's time we were having a really fun party and this girl crashed it. Miss Ratfink. She spilled fucking beer all over her pussy. And she started rubbing her pussy through her jeans to like kind of wipe it off, but she got too into it and she did it in Nile's face while he was sitting on the couch and he looked really scary. Cause Nile was drinking his coffee and enjoying his own time. He was having his little safe coffee zone. How the fuck did these people get in your general quarters? Dude, she came back from... I don't know, man. Scary. She came back from a prior UK experience. Oh. She crashed her party, ruined all the fun, and she rubbed the pussy in Nile's face and he screamed the rat out.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:30.906 --> 0:09:31.952]: 
  Shut up, I've seen it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:31.952 --> 0:09:32.003]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:32.003 --> 0:09:32.459]: 
  No.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:36.441 --> 0:09:36.947]: 
  He even said.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:36.998 --> 0:09:40.019]: 
  Yeah, oh that was the one.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:09:49.401 --> 0:09:50.954]: 
  I would, you know, if the robot...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:58.986 --> 0:09:59.948]: 
  I think justified to be like,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:07.002 --> 0:10:08.689]: 
  It is what we do.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:12.132 --> 0:10:13.262]: 
  That is what we do.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:10:13.262 --> 0:10:13.448]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:18.527 --> 0:10:20.232]: 
  Oh, you just got...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:22.628 --> 0:10:22.898]: 
  is true.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:23.640 --> 0:10:24.349]: 
  It's true.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:25.412 --> 0:10:25.817]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:26.695 --> 0:10:26.999]: 
  people

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:26.999 --> 0:10:27.792]: 
  You can learn.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:43.806 --> 0:10:43.890]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:51.990 --> 0:10:53.425]: 
  How do you define yourself?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:56.850 --> 0:10:57.070]: 
  Do you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:10:57.981 --> 0:10:58.437]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:10:58.437 --> 0:10:58.774]: 
  you know

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:07.954 --> 0:11:11.650]: 
  Here's possible. So in some ways, you could argue that yes, you can beat the lame out of it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:19.277 --> 0:11:19.328]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:19.986 --> 0:11:20.222]: 
  least he's got a ruler. Aw, it's a long moving

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:25.251 --> 0:11:27.377]: 
  way they are and they don't really deserve it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:35.123 --> 0:11:35.815]: 
  I'm talking about a good one.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:44.438 --> 0:11:44.455]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:47.475 --> 0:11:50.715]: 
  over his lap and wiping it all over your face.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:11:51.559 --> 0:11:52.032]: 
  That's all.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:58.394 --> 0:11:58.664]: 
  We'll see you next time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:25.208 --> 0:12:25.461]: 
  He was.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:43.956 --> 0:13:08.425]: 
  Sounds like she was trying to get the party started. No, it's like when the party ends and then the wild person comes in I nobody wants them there personally I think she had one of those stinky pussies, so she's trying to make the beer soak up that stank because There's nothing like some fucking rancid beer to really just freshen up Dirty beer. She's a wah wah. Freezer burn fish steak pussy

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:50.115 --> 0:12:50.453]: 
  First

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:02.485 --> 0:13:03.565]: 
  That's a beard.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:10.939 --> 0:13:22.195]: 
  You ever have that? Professor Pern? No, I haven't! You're talking about? How do you cope with these words? I just don't want to bet this is your only choice. Corey's 3 AM nightly excursions. Corey, do a hypothetical quick.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:18.060 --> 0:13:18.077]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:23.055 --> 0:13:33.130]: 
  Oh god, I'm not good at these. Shad hates hypotheticals. Really? Yeah. Shad's always like, this is totally illogical. This would never happen. Why waste time discussing this thing that is not based in reality?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:24.254 --> 0:13:24.878]: 
  Shed heats up.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:31.982 --> 0:13:36.505]: 
  That's some of his hypotheticals. Literally? That's not what he thinks about it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:33.805 --> 0:13:34.581]: 
  Literally

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:35.222 --> 0:13:43.289]: 
  Literally that's like saying like Shed, what if your eyeballs were boobs? What? It would be boring, a lot of cloth over your eyes a lot of the time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:37.315 --> 0:13:39.441]: 
  There's no doors, no windows.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:39.441 --> 0:13:39.576]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:43.947 --> 0:14:52.409]: 
  I'd be there. There's your high pedigal. Well, you can rub their eyes and it feels really good. Oh, that's true. That's insane. It's like elephantitis, but like just over both of your eyes. You just, you can't do anything about it. Like, you can't do that trick where you close one eye so you can like see the side of your nose. You can't do that when your eyes are nipples. Chad, if a really fine lady walks in and she's like, hey baby, and you're like, this is a very nice looking specimen and she takes out her teddy and puts it in her mouth. She goes up and down, up and down in rank. She takes out her own breast and puts it in her mouth. Like, she... I would think she's insane. So she goes down? I would just think like she's clearly mentally ill or something. But she's doing it to like be like, I think you're a very sexy, Chad. I've also got your voice. I would. I would. It's just Chad with the wig. Where is this? In your office. In my office? Yeah, you're there working. She got in the house. How did she get in the house? She snuck in when you weren't looking. I don't fucking know. She comes out from underneath your desk and she has her hands up already. She saves some time. She's been there the whole time. She's like fantasy girls where... Well, when you're like, oh man, I'm very horny and you push a button in your wall and a portal opens and she steps out. She's like, I'm here to serve you, master, but she puts one of her boobs in her mouth. She won't take that. That's not what she wants.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:44.165 --> 0:13:47.490]: 
  There's your, there's your happy pedagol. Go like rub their eyes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:48.520 --> 0:13:50.005]: 
  probably will be the next game.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:51.996 --> 0:13:52.958]: 
  both of your eyes.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:13:53.768 --> 0:13:54.072]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:15.368 --> 0:14:16.920]: 
  She goes down.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:19.924 --> 0:14:20.549]: 
  What she's doing is...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:24.227 --> 0:14:31.770]: 
  I would. It's just shad with the wig. Where is this? In your office. In my office? Yeah, you're gonna work in your drawing. She actually got in the house.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:39.550 --> 0:14:41.997]: 
  She's been there the whole time.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:41.997 --> 0:14:42.672]: 
  You think?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:51.244 --> 0:14:56.847]: 
  She won't take that's not what I wouldn't like that's not what a fan is So you send it back to the person? Send it back, send it back

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:53.050 --> 0:17:57.308]: 
  Like that's not what a fantasy is. So you send it back to the Earth. Send it back. Send it back. Get out of here. Go back to your portal. Here's a question I know Shad would actually answer. So based on evolution, what do you think the next evo- like just from amoebas to, you know, land walking, amphibian fish, to monkeys, to humans, what do you think the next phase of evolution for humans is? Like people say like aliens, like the big head watermelon head aliens, are like what we would become. Everyone should give their two cents on this. Yeah, absolutely. But this is one that Shad would just immediately be like, this is a logical. Yeah, like what do you think we would look like? Monkeys, humans, snakes. Yeah, what's next? What would be our difference? I think we'd be a charred corpse. Why? Because we're not going to last much longer. That's true. That's false. If we live, if we live. When the sun explodes. It's not going to evolve into a next 30 billion years. You fucking see about that. Did you check the weather report? The sun is exploding. But next time, something like that, you'd have to see that this gene pool. Sorry, Corey hasn't answered it yet. He said charred. He said fucking charred. I thought that was your answer. I was being, it was my answer. He was being mischievous. If I was to say what the next evolutionary thing would be, if it's not that, it would replace all things that fail. Like when your body fails, you get replacements for it. And eventually we'd all be androids. You think we're going to get like a million, regrowth ability? Yeah, yeah. Like we're going to start, they're going to realize like, hey, we have this 3D printer that prints organs. That's actually not insane. Yeah, that's what's happening right there. And they're going to be like, why can't we just stick this inside of someone's body so when their arm gets blown off, it immediately grows back. Like some crazy. Or just stick them in like one of those Goku tubes, like the capsule tubes. Where it just like, you know, scans your body. It takes like a month, but it's worth it. But it does like every cell, like you know, every cell in your body that's dying. Yeah, exactly. Or malfunctioning. I do feel like that's the next evolution. The next evolution is slowing growth down and speeding up durability for the human body. Like we're going to realize that like our body is... So we stay younger, longer, and we live longer. Yeah, they're going to find a way to make it so like, we no longer, bodies don't fail anymore. Now they find ways to like, keep the hearts pumping even when the... But even if they had the technology, they'd have to keep it so limited because if it became like relatively accessible, population problem is already, you know, I mean, it's not as bad as it was before, but it's still happening. In the moment people live even longer, that population problem is going to get out of control. And I feel like that really would create like this 1%, that the 1% would live for like 500 years. Meanwhile, they got bulldozers going through like, you know, shitty towns and hoods, basically just plowing down the people that aren't dying. So when the purge happens, we have an... No, the purge, yeah. Every year. What is it? The New World Order? They keep talking about the Illuminati's... The one day where everybody kills each other, because it's okay. That'll save that. And the people who live, get their fucking Bionic Commando arms. That's mine, that's mine. What's yours, Chris? That's not too far off for me. Mine, I was thinking more like appearance-wise. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So let's just go with that. Right. We're gonna get fins. What the fuck, Corey? That was mine. What a good... Corey has three.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:22.446 --> 0:15:26.395]: 
  Yeah, absolutely. This is one that Chad would just immediately be like, this is a logical one.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:28.994 --> 0:15:30.057]: 
  humans next.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:32.065 --> 0:15:32.369]: 
  I think

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:37.026 --> 0:15:37.178]: 
  That's all for this video. Thanks for watching. I'll see you in the next video.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:37.178 --> 0:15:38.460]: 
  That's true too.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:38.460 --> 0:15:39.962]: 
  If we lived.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:41.920 --> 0:15:44.991]: 
  We're not gonna evolve into a next 30 billion years.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:48.383 --> 0:15:49.615]: 
  Mix it up something like that

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:53.429 --> 0:15:56.770]: 
  You said fucking short pulses. I thought that was your answer. I would always be...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:15:58.154 --> 0:15:59.335]: 
  You must've been mischievous.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:10.641 --> 0:16:10.844]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:12.649 --> 0:16:13.189]: 
  Yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:18.539 --> 0:16:22.285]: 
  Oh, and that's actually not insane. Yeah, that's what's happening right now.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:27.668 --> 0:16:28.731]: 
 ..so silly..

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:31.245 --> 0:16:35.127]: 
  Yeah, little tubes just like you know scans your body like a month, but yeah, but

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:38.637 --> 0:16:40.358]: 
  your ear or your mouth on scene.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:16:48.357 --> 0:16:51.563]: 
  Like we're gonna realize that like our bodies stay younger longer and

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:28.637 --> 0:17:28.840]: 
  So

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:29.920 --> 0:17:30.510]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:31.658 --> 0:17:32.451]: 
  What is it the new?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:37.109 --> 0:17:38.003]: 
  Yeah. It's OK.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:38.003 --> 0:17:38.459]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:43.639 --> 0:17:45.647]: 
  What's yours Chris? That's not too far off from me.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:48.651 --> 0:17:50.372]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So let's just go with that.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:17:55.772 --> 0:17:59.451]: 
  Korea's three. Korea's three. Best of the three.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:59.451 --> 0:23:42.216]: 
  Well, what way are we gonna be able to fly, Chris? I don't know, like, um, if you look at like, monkeys, right? They've got long ass arms and little ass legs. That's true. They've got no butts. Makes no sense. We, like, they've got little dog asses, like. Yeah, little triangles. We grew, like, these big, fat, cushiony asses. So we're gonna get bigger asses and smaller arms and legs? No, I'm serious, right? So if you look at a monkey's asshole, it's like, it's always a prolapse, like, always, right? Yeah. They've got these, um, these, like, shoulder blades for, like, butt cheeks. And their legs suck and they just look generally gross, right? Yeah. And the further you look down evolution, like, this isn't something that I'm thinking because I'm myself a human, right? But they do get genuinely more attractive and less gross the further you go down, right? I don't know. There might have been a caveman somewhere along the line that was kind of a freak of nature who was, like, this hot ass. Yeah, probably. Yeah. But what I'm saying is, like, the further you go, um, the more our bodies, like, change into these, like, curvaceous, like, nicer to look at things. So I think in the future, everyone's gonna have fucking giant asses, huge long cocks. I guess from an evolutionary standpoint, though, if... Fucking shaved heads. But, like, people are wanting to hook up with more attractive people, right? Yeah. So that makes sense that, like, you know, they are procreating, look, a lot of people are fucking. Yeah. But if we're getting to the point where it's less about survival and more about, like, what we think people look like based on their physical features, then that is something that technically over time... Yeah. I think, um, you know, people like fuck each other's asses a lot now. Yeah. I think the human body's gonna eventually be like, we need to evolve a tiny hole to let the sperm leak through into the pussy here. If we could lose the need to shit, that would be great. Yeah. If we could, like, excrete waste in other ways that was more efficient, like, use it as energy, and then whatever the last bit is just hokkeluge, and then that's it. Yeah, I really like the system they had in Scary Movie 3 where they pee out of their fingertips. Yeah, but what about, like, it was actually like, oh, wow, that is kinda... What about a... What about a... What about a... Easier to name. What about, like, corn and seeds? You can't just, like, wha-tuh. There's a little corn on the ground. There's corn on the ground. Just... Wait, there's one more thing. You know, the way people's hair has started receding over the millions of years, Yeah....on, onto their head. It used to be on their faces, but now there's an on their head. Yeah. I think eventually it's gonna be, like, one tiny little point on top of your head. There's just a lot of hair growing out. Just, like, this, this dagger that'll wheel, like, fucking, like, gel it up to turn it into weapons. Yeah. Like, alfalfa from fucking Little Rascals. Yeah, he had it first. He set the goal. We're gonna evolve out the need for more organs. I like Chris's... Oh, yeah, cause there's a bunch of organs we don't even fucking need. Yeah. Are there- The goldbladder. We don't need the goldbladder. Yeah, are some people born without wisdom teeth? Cause those are fucking useless and actually dangerous. They can, like, push your teeth into your skull. They completely fucked with my teeth. Toncil? We don't use tonsils anymore. More appendixes. Appendix to tons- yeah, tonsils, appendix. I mean, we have tonsils. We don't necessarily need them. Yeah, male nipples. What the fuck? Well, that's because you go through, like, a female, like, everyone starts out as, like, you know. But you wouldn't need it. You move into it when a base is on the floor. But your gender isn't necessarily set until- Yeah, it's gender neutral. Right. So you have a nipple and no cock. You have a penis and vagina and you get born. And then your fucking cock, like, splits in half and we get a line and that. We're gonna get a line and that. Shit out every bad toxin in our bodies all into one little black ball. Yeah. And then burn it for a few of us. Yeah, I was gonna say, like, if you're like a perfect black pearl and then you can use them for energy. Yeah, nibbler had the right idea. Yeah, exactly. Throw it on the ground and disappear like an engine. We're gonna shrink it. Can they, like, fuel their ships with that or something? It had, like, the density of a small star or something? Yeah, I mean, we're gonna shrink it into little nibblers. What do you think, Shed? You see, I think everything, like, Corey and Chris have been saying, it was more out of, like, personal convenience. Like, what will happen? What is good for us? Uh, excuse me. That's what evolution is. No, it's not the- No, it's not the- Bigger dicks, shitty gutter organs. Let me explain to you what evolution is. Oh, it's not. Evolution is when the gene pool is plastic to the environment. Meaning, the environment shapes what the gene pool will be like. That's why the monkeys needed to be like that to cry around. I don't think it's that. It's when you're like, one of your things mutates in your body, and then if that happens to suit your environment, that will survive. Because that's why the gene pool is plastic to the environment. Yeah. Because if it happens to suit. But our environment isn't harsher anymore, like it used to be. Oh, you're right. So we're not going upwards. We have now come to this stagnating phase where we are making everything comfortable for us with technology. We're gonna turn into javas. No, so it will be like this- Java the hush. Yeah, we're gonna just, like, fucking turn into javas. Slime slugs. We live in the age where it's like, you know, the little bit thing, like a slight weather change is called for the news. Like, it's like, listen, it was slightly cold today and I couldn't wear, like, a comfortable outfit. It's like, this is a big deal to me. But we live in the day and age where people like us, for example, where we can just work on the computer, we can just do that. We don't have to move anymore. Like, we don't have to move much. So a lot of our functions we have, we don't even need. We don't need to climb trees. And not only that, but- We need legs though, because we do use legs periodically. We have proven as a species that brains brings you further than bronze. Yeah. So the evolution that Krish was talking about, that was gonna go to this upwards thing, no, that is false. I know it's not, because- Do you think we're just gonna devolve into, like, a head? Not devolve. We have actually mastered technology to our benefit, and we cannot even imagine our life without technology. Exactly, that's why I think- You look like a barn into technology, you'll be dying into technology. We will start replacing the pointless things. Our brains will be replaced with computers. The information we learn at school will be pointless, because we'll already know everything, because we'll have it all calculated before anyone else. It's like, we'll just, everything will be given to us, and we will basically be cybernetic. That is always going to be the future. But you're also all, like, approaching the future, I think, in kind of a weird way. But I'm gonna die before that happens, so I'm- Are you sure? I mean, of course this is all just hypothetical. This is the answer. But you're approaching the future in a way where you're saying, like,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:02.624 --> 0:18:02.640]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:12.040 --> 0:18:12.917]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:17.828 --> 0:18:18.014]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:47.528 --> 0:18:47.916]: 
  Yeah, probably.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:18:48.540 --> 0:18:50.194]: 
  But what I'm saying is like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:08.672 --> 0:19:09.837]: 
  Yeah, so that makes sense.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:22.662 --> 0:19:22.982]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:26.340 --> 0:19:26.830]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:31.217 --> 0:19:31.420]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:41.865 --> 0:19:42.625]: 
  Yeah, I really like it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:47.063 --> 0:19:51.062]: 
  It was actually like, oh, that was fun. It would have been easier to aim.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:55.214 --> 0:19:56.867]: 
  There's a little corn on the ground.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:01.710 --> 0:20:02.166]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:04.157 --> 0:20:04.461]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:07.752 --> 0:20:08.849]: 
  There's a lot of hair growing out.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:13.304 --> 0:20:13.439]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:13.439 --> 0:20:13.658]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:16.307 --> 0:20:16.560]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:24.340 --> 0:20:25.859]: 
  Yeah. Are there- There's some people-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:40.422 --> 0:20:41.316]: 
  We don't necessarily need to.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:47.830 --> 0:20:47.999]: 
  but

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:48.674 --> 0:20:49.129]: 
  You move.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:49.737 --> 0:20:50.445]: 
  Oh, that's

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:52.302 --> 0:20:55.913]: 
  It's gender neutral, so you have a nipple and no con.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:56.689 --> 0:20:57.584]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:00.030 --> 0:21:00.942]: 
  We're gonna get a line in there.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:06.460 --> 0:21:08.957]: 
  Yeah, I was gonna say like, he's like a perfect...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:12.940 --> 0:21:14.324]: 
  Yeah, exactly.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:15.015 --> 0:21:15.960]: 
  We're gonna shrink

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:20.010 --> 0:21:20.871]: 
  We're gonna

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:22.255 --> 0:21:22.660]: 
  What do you think?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:28.465 --> 0:21:32.650]: 
  What will happen? What is good for us? Excuse me? That's what evolution is. No, it's not the loo...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:34.759 --> 0:21:36.379]: 
  but it's not what iteration is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:48.462 --> 0:21:48.934]: 
  I don't think it's...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:54.334 --> 0:21:55.499]: 
  because then

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:12.002 --> 0:22:15.074]: 
  No, so it will, no, it will be like this. Job of the hud? Yeah, we're gonna just...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:16.289 --> 0:22:17.504]: 
  I can turn it into javas.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:43.373 --> 0:22:43.474]: 
  We

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:51.304 --> 0:22:51.490]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:56.097 --> 0:22:58.594]: 
  I know it's not because you think we're just gonna devolve

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:06.660 --> 0:23:08.382]: 
  Exactly that's why I think

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:33.019 --> 0:23:33.525]: 
  But I'm...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:35.331 --> 0:23:35.837]: 
  Are you sure?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:42.216 --> 0:23:45.237]: 
  like what we're doing now, that's gonna be the future.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:45.237 --> 0:24:36.030]: 
  Yeah, but that is backwards. No, what we're doing now create at the past because the past is all we have the future doesn't exist All we have is the past. Yeah, what we create it now What we're doing now creates our knowledge of the past because it's echoes. Yeah, you know You don't think there's foresight based on what we're doing now that's going to inform what the future could be I mean obviously none of us know that is that is that but you can't know that like that is the future does not exist The way people are now is they're like super obsessed with like appearance and looks right like everyone's like I want a really hot girl from a boyfriend So in the future everyone's gonna see like people gonna mutate and grow fucking giant asses overnight, right? They're gonna be like whoa I want to fuck this new creature right over here with the giant perfect ass overnight overnight And then the next day they're gonna have a little baby with a giant perfect ass, right?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:47.532 --> 0:23:48.460]: 
  No, it's not.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:06.972 --> 0:24:08.440]: 
  I mean, obviously none of us know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:29.061 --> 0:24:29.635]: 
  overnight.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:32.774 --> 0:24:38.494]: 
  No, but you're just your attractive kind like the ones that are

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:38.494 --> 0:27:56.505]: 
  and seek out attractiveness art and majority that is false. That's true. That will be the fossil food like the food for like the Stronger ones will not even have kids because oh, I don't ruin my body use a condom Please Darwin has rule I actually do know a lot of people that don't even watch it anymore because of that They don't want to ruin your body purchase your robot, baby, and you'll be Aged well, but then when you're tired of it, you'll just upgrade to have you seen AI. It's exactly like that That's the future me and Corey are going to get killed by the attractive feeble Listen chat. I'm gonna get a big dick and there's nothing Big dick a big ponytail sticking out of the tip and all you slug beings are gonna fucking burn when salt falls from the heavens if for some reason like you know like our ozone layer the next 50 years like started depleting in you know, Whatever the case is there's gonna open guys gonna spit a big look yeah Hypothetically something like that happen And all of a sudden like we were getting a shit ton of radiation like in a short amount of time People would have to adapt in a certain way like evolution wise like we'd have to be able to withstand a certain amount of radiation and like the Body would have to form to that for all we know in the next 300 years. It could happen soon There's already gonna be people that have like you know scales on their skin in order to survive the radiation that comes No, yeah, that'll happen, but it's like I'll be dead so it's cool My body's not ready for it anyways I find your beauty thing a good interesting thing also because a lot of this stuff you perceive to be as beauty is artificially mean no, that's not genetic, but there are certain things though where it's like you would rather see Something smooth and curvaceous than something prolapse and square covered in hair, right? Okay, let's say you're somebody who smokes a lot and your lungs have holes in them They're fucking not existing anymore. You're just like you're just like I need a new organ. I'll pay whatever for it You get a new organ. It's a brand new lung It functions exactly the prior one because it's already discovered the enzymes or whatever to make the things work They go new lung and everything's better again because this is the world we live in Yeah, we need to fit be comfortable if something doesn't work we get rid of it and fix it with something new That's diffusion with technology That's that's why they regressive form because we will just fit everything around us to our exact Even if we even if we have strokes on our fucking body start shutting down We still have ways to have like a solar flare and fuck up all our technology in like one day You know what we were talking about good-looking people like evolving and shit like I think that also comes from like when you look at something healthy it looks like a certain way and something unhealthy looks the other way and Things in the past looked unhealthier than they do now I don't know. I mean some people like a lot of people really attracted to like Helena Bonham Carter, right? She looks like a fucking heroin addict corpse who but at the same time some people think Kim Kardashian looks like a fucking Bulbas human wreck. I guess it comes down to cosmetic debauchery. That's what I think Miley Cyrus looks like personally Yeah, right, but some people yeah, so I think it's interesting like it's also aesthetics too like we're talking about oh good-looking You know, but some people like no butts some people like big butts I like a little monkey shoulder boy some people like things that look kind of sickly and whatever And some things that look healthy. I think at the end it doesn't come down to what people like It's what they can obtain what is obtainable to them sure so they always want what you don't have

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:47.640 --> 0:24:48.180]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:29.944 --> 0:27:30.434]: 
  medic

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:31.328 --> 0:27:31.564]: 
  That's all.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:43.900 --> 0:27:44.355]: 
  some people

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:47.022 --> 0:27:49.199]: 
  and some people like things that look super healthy.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:55.206 --> 0:28:02.445]: 
  So they always want what you don't have? No, they might find that girl on television really hard. You want to do it Chris? But they fuck your ugly girlfriend. Yeah, also, also.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:58.210 --> 0:28:10.765]: 
  You wanted to hear Chris. But they fucked your ugly girlfriend. Also, yeah, Chris, even if there's really pretty people, there's still that subset of people who are still really looking for those slugs who spit out 10 babies. They're still in it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:02.445 --> 0:28:03.441]: 
  Yeah, good for her.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:05.179 --> 0:28:05.466]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:11.355 --> 0:33:25.500]: 
  Our generation, our generation, our tastes are very like fluid. This is something I think about a lot where it's like people focus on looks so much that an argument can be solved by saying like Yo, well you look like a fat fucking idiot and then everyone's like ah It's like why did he win that argument by saying this because every single person is obsessed with looks so You know it's interesting you say that because Shad and I actually were talking about bananas today Yeah, and the idea that even in I'm not saying I'm a hundred percent along with the you know Oh looks will dictate evolution However, I will say that a lot of foods that we have have been produced and manipulated genetically to look Better and for people better than a bowl. So in that way that is the ever like we have altered the evolution of certain foods Just to aesthetically please also cows and Right, you know when you go to those like fucking like the album, but they're not even more healthy No, I know I'm not even like better for you. You know, you know, it's just looks better You know when you go to like the Alamo and shit and there's like these like Indian people holding up like maize and corn and stuff And it's all in Tom and I'm hated and red and disgusting Yeah, yeah, so corn used to look like until we spice it up with a little bit of gene splicing Yeah, spiced it up. We made it look fucking bland as shit. It's this Damn pale ass yellow Homogenous, yeah, you know what you're not sticking your fucking cursed red Maze corn and you're not sticking that you're not sticking your fucking Alamo decoration into all your damn food you make true I wish I had putting your beautiful like vibrant yellow corn that we've made by the truckloads every few seconds In everything else and by the way that may stuff was impossible to eat. It was like it was fucking infected It had like disease really not yet. You know how do you know so much about this? Thing if you look at maze If you look at maze originally it was like it was nonsense like you you got so much stuff from it You couldn't eat it. It was actually painful to eat. It was sharp. It was hard to eat But now we've made corn into like just everybody's That's what has shit looks like it's just like an amazing. I think it's one of the most like human things there is now It's like every single thing has to look good What's the medical thing where you can splice genes in order to like get rid of diseases and stuff really? Yeah, what's it called? It's a thing where you like you can find out if you're if your child's going to have a certain disease Before it's even born if I can find out, you know, whether my child is gonna have a certain genetic disease And if they're gonna have it not bring them to life, you know not bring them into this world, you know Why is that unethical? Yeah, these people online ask like how many chromosomes do you have right? Well, no, I think it does stuff like that Like checks how many chromosomes I mean whatever it is there is a thing but regardless This is the age we live in it is and so but with that it just like all other like technologies like oh the internet's this great thing because with it We can communicate and our knowledge of the world will grow together and greater But instead is just used for fucking, you know meme faces and dick pics and fucking, you know, whatever and Minecraft videos But I think the same thing with that technology where if you were able to like alter the genetics of your children before they're born What would we I mean? We would say that we're doing it for health We would say we're doing it for the longevity of the race But in fact what would people really be doing would they just do it to make their kids look like the next Kim Kardashian? I want my kid to look like the next Johnny Depp, you know, what do I have to do? What genes do I have? There would probably be some sort of like you can't do this unless you sick sir go home It's like but I want to make my son's dick 58 feet long Well you said Chris that obsession with visuals is more present than ever Yeah, it's like the German saying that men's is an augent here. Did you say? You did You say men's men's that means human in German The thing is that the human is an animal of the eye. Yeah, so like that is his most important organ It is Every single day you'll hear a sentence that's like like talking about it has someone or something looks but it's always someone though It's like oh, yeah, she's very good looking. It's like, okay But we also are creatures that can dilute themselves into thinking that something is good looking because it is our Like you know like when you're like someone you have to accept your faith like a woman or something. Yeah, she's she's my precious angel You know, but it's not it's like to others like what the fuck are you talking about? But that person is so deluded that he's like shut up. Yeah, it's like it's also like Well society does that to us all the time. They're telling us what's beautiful all the time I'm not saying that I'm not like I don't like good-looking people or like I don't like a good-looking girl I'm just like the question is what do you think things look good because you what you think looks hot It's not necessarily what everybody else exactly I'm just saying like I don't like it when people will end an argument or just like oh, yeah, of course That's as merit like yeah, it's like it has nothing to do with it. You've lost once you do that It's like I don't like that at all. Yeah, that's like people say I like I like attractive ladies Everyone's attracted to whatever they want. It's the same thing when people say oh shut up. You're poor. Yeah It's like what yeah, wow you lose you've lost sir. Yeah, you know why we are so visual Why because sex is such an important thing because of reproduction. Oh, yeah, that's back at our vinyan thing So we are attracted

  I'm not saying that I'm not like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:49.337 --> 0:32:51.008]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:25.500 --> 0:33:27.947]: 
  it to what looks healthy and what looks intelligent.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:27.947 --> 0:34:53.436]: 
  Yeah, so by law of nature you should be attracted to the mainstream ideal Sex is like the thing that nobody can just dismiss and be like it's not important It's like the most important thing that anybody nearly all the time. It's like oh anyone ever fucking thinks about but without the survival Instinct shad we're able to focus less on survival and therefore the needs of that like look for the most attractive thing based on the Mainstream and we're able to focus more on ourselves and in our own neuroses You know what I mean like people being attracted to people that look like their mom because of like some weird thing or because they have an Eating disorder right they see this skinny or this fat girl is like really really attractive You know all of a sudden because we're not so worried about just getting to the next day It just opens up the doors for all sorts of things to be attractive Yeah, that's also another like point is like while there is like the norm like everything has to be pretty We've also moved kind of this society where people hold themselves higher than others So how you perceive people is like yeah, this is me. This is what I want in life and this is what I'm going after I don't give a shit what you like right which is basically that yeah And also in an age where everybody wants to be different everybody Oh, yes, no flake you have just like constant conflict with what is what and it's like That's why we need technology to come in and start sticking wires into us and get our shit together Chris yeah, but since you have like such interesting views on beauty. Why don't you like indulge us in your perfect woman?

You want me to be serious? It was a serious question. I don't know, I like a little bit of meat, a little bit of love handles. Wait a minute. Yeah, I like, I do like pale skin though. I like dark hair. It's interesting, like... That's about it. I like big asses and big titties. I was gonna say, societally pale skin is one of those things like certain cultures really covet it and certain cultures don't like it at all. Yeah, I know, that's my views. Where but you? Yeah, she had, you're gonna dish it out. Okay, okay, look, you see the way he described this, like, it's all for him. It's all about me, you know what? I want big breasts, not for me, for my children so they can have milk. Wide hips, not for me, so you can bear my offspring. Yeah, but I think you're like, asexual or some shit. You want Gerda? I just imagine this big, like, German fucking bread maker. She's like, working the fucking till I need milk. I need strong arms, because you can work in the field. You need like nice, like, hairy arms, whatever the fuck they want. Yeah, you get a nice one, man. People can like, go skinny ladies, they can like, big fat, huge ladies. I will come home and be like, Guten Abend, vibe. Good truth? And she would take care of my children and give me my dinner. She'll come down, she'll carry your kids in her breasts, she'd be like, I made bread.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:04.607 --> 0:35:05.991]: 
  You see you give him a serious

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:05.991 --> 0:35:07.240]: 
  There's another question in here!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:19.812 --> 0:35:20.436]: 
  That's the...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:20.436 --> 0:35:20.959]: 
  That's what it is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:45.867 --> 0:35:46.795]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:20.545 --> 0:38:10.350]: 
  She's fucking spit out a baby. You got good for you. I want some And then she'd go out into the field and she fucking Yeah, they just snap its neck with her bare arms she big and she'd use you Fucking leg off of it bring it back into the house bear like blow fire through her lips She would bamboo and fire rip a cow in half like a fucking weightlifter and give you the meat and kiss you on the forehead She'd rub she'd rub two steaks together so hard that they'd actually cook and then she put it You get a woman who's basically If some guy comes up to you so cartoonishly bend the gun back yes Do you think it's wrong that people are attracted to specific things like that no not at all I think that's good. I think that's good. I was just joking. I think it's good that people have still sexual interest Otherwise, what would you be alive for yeah? No? Everybody has what they're into. I know a sexual people who are fucking delighted. They don't have to worry about it Yeah, other things to focus on I do think that you know and it's kind of a cliche But I do think it's really true that personality really does alter the perception of a person you could have someone who you know If you'd never spoken with them you'd think they were dropped yet gorgeous You have you know you spend a little time with this person and you're just like you cannot unsee the ugly You know I mean and vice versa that's 100% true. That's happened to me a few times where like I you know I'll see you girl and I'd be like nope like cuz I'm just an asshole. Yeah, and they'll talk to you like wow you're cool Yeah, I like you this is but again brain deputing everyone people are still attracted to looks and that the no That's the initial thing impossible not to be yeah before you talk to anyone before you read a book before you do anything You see something first. Yeah, and that is that initial instinct You know you're not gonna look at a pile of shit and go hmm. I wonder if there's a golden nugget in women or not pieces of shit

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:27.379 --> 0:36:30.045]: 
  She fucking bought you a cow in the head, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:38.854 --> 0:36:40.525]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:37:02.310 --> 0:37:03.104]:

Yeah, probably if it is the right one. Yeah, I could you could too. I don't think I'd ever marry anyone I don't know though marriage is that is a highly I think it is it. I think I feel like marriage is a scam. It's like a huge scam Oh as someone who had been married for eight years I will say that in retrospect I do think marriage is very contrived and I do think it's very it is the epitome of unnatural to me Yeah, that's really I'm not saying that being with a person for a long time Just the concept and being loyal to them or things like that. I don't think signing papers Yeah, I don't think those are unnatural, but yeah the papers signing papers You are in love. This is what happens if you bring yes I think that is very unnatural or the fact that we and the implications of people put on that or rings rings like Wedding rings are complete. Yeah, I really don't like that idea Exactly before we wait before we upset a shit ton of married people right people can get married and be very happy and die happy No, absolutely. We're talking about that, but that's the thing right nearly okay 90% of people I know who do that just they get a divorce and they like it's a huge ordeal that like ruins a year of their life And it's like they got to go through all this fucking bullshit with the court and spend a shit ton of money I think you just not get married was never about love love was a byproduct that may or may not happen Basically out of survival so you didn't kill your fucking spouse But before marriages were all fucking arranged But I think that once marriage became about love now the factors have changed because if marriage is now about love, right? That means the moment you or that as soon as you don't feel like you guys are in love anymore Well, then what's the fucking purpose? Yeah, like why are you still doing this? That's when you get those parents that just fucking hate each other, but they stick together out of convenience or obligation I know way too many married people who are just fucking furious at each other all the time And it's like they'll at the end of the day they'll like hugging kiss for like a second But it doesn't not it's not right because it's like like you you can definitely marry slight like don't get me wrong You can marry someone be like yeah, this is great like we're in love We're gonna die happy and you die happy and you had a great marriage right for the fuck Well, you can also start a let's play Minecraft channel and blow up But most of the time when you start that shit you ain't gonna get more than ten fucking views and most of them We're gonna be dislikes anyway if I met someone like and I really love them I'd be like yeah, you know what we probably get married, but I'm not signing that you get half my shit That is bullshit that is fucking a complete scam and then a girl like most girls gonna be like what you don't trust me Most girls can be like, you know trust me fucking pieces. It's like wow I'm glad I asked that you fucking psycho. There's also alimony. Yeah, like the concept of alimony, which is like, you know I was paid as Subsidement out of money and I still deserve that even when we're there's just too much that can go wrong It's like rich people and it's like it's also the whole I'm completely ignorant Okay, I'm like 25 years old and marriage is the last thing on my fucking mind But I've always thought the idea like conceptually of giving a ring. Yeah, like oh purchasing a ring for like thousands of dollars The whole antics behind that too is its own subsets subset of bullshit like oh Therefore what do you know? But you know like people who like oh, I lost my ring and it's like it's like oh, I'm gonna get in I'm gonna be so I'm gonna get so much I'm just gonna be right why if the if your person you were with is like Understands that you guys are committed together and it's like why would they be upset that you lost it? It's I understand that but it's still kind of like shouldn't you guys still be on like a level of trust It's a thing right and you're an object when you get drunk you're like oh, yeah, right exactly My dick's just gonna slip into somebody you know when you see people getting like tattoos of like they're like girlfriends names and their arm and shit It's like a stupidest fucking idea in the world right unless you murder them and it's kind of like a mark For every girlfriend. I still think that's more forgivable than a ring because rings that are like they're overpriced and stupid And it's just this like concept that shouldn't exist It's like it's like and you can lose it It's like what why the fuck that like at least you can't lose the tattoo and it's like cut off your body You know it's like it's like tombstones like people spend like thousand thousand dollars to get the nicest tombstone But in the end you're just fucking in the ground worms come on I did you think like that then you could say that about everything yeah everything I die put a stone there and be like dead man when I go to the graveyard, right? There's two graves. They fucking love right it's like one guy the graveyard got a grave So that his grave was a fucking bench. It's like you were the coolest egg I've ever met I could sit on you and be happy for like a minute. It's cool. I had a tribute bench at high school That's fucking awesome. I love that right because it's like if I was a bend Yeah, but it was a bench. I'd have butt curves in it It wasn't it wasn't a comfy bench. It was some bullshit stone bitch. I want to get like a public toilet as a grave No, but um I know the other graves are really cool are the Chinese graves where they have these shrines that you know What I was saying for get I get fucking castrated for time I'm talking about the conceptual idea that like you pen spend thousands of dollars because they force you to these people are like Oh, you have to get the sixteen thousand dollars. Well, there's also the engagement ring and the wedding Yeah, but I'm talking about like that and the wedding. Yeah, we talked about it But it's still like that like it's still like that shit It's still like no matter what you're always gonna be having some sort of overly expensive item to be remembered by and it's like It's not a terrible thing, but it's just like what Chris said like we're all remembered by how commercially like I Honestly think that if you took the money that you spent on rings and the wedding and instead Planned a trip with the person that you're supposed to marry that to me I think is a lot more about a party dude. He cost more than the fucking wedding ring at the time Yeah, no, absolutely tens and thousands of dollars and for the rich people like a million dollar wedding or whatever But honestly and when I say a trip I don't mean just some like oh go on a cruise to some Caribbean island I mean grab the money that you would take from this wedding or the wedding ring Yeah, find the person that you are marrying experience You're gonna do that and then yeah go to Alaska bring some backpacks and survive the wilderness for a month Then you will know No, that's true But you would know that this person was clearly not fit to survive because they got eaten by a bear you guys go out into the woods and Then for your lives as a team. This isn't the fucking discovery channel We don't have to do this and if you both survive and come back I don't want to fucking do that you want to remember this day instead of spending a fucking trillion dollars on making all your friends Think you're cool for a day. Yeah fucking bring her to like Japan and fucking Yeah, I see the silverback gorilla is fucking experience Money And ride the silverback gorilla's absolutely how about this instead of buying a expensive casket for you and your wife buying a ring Buying a wedding party. Yeah, but you tell take a little bit of that money Buy a gun two bullets for the both of you and end your life because you fucking a guy's gonna get married a fucking loser I'm gonna be fucking you might as well just end it right now. Your time is over. I just like Like I really think if a girl can understand and be like, you know what I agree that this is like This is kind of like a governmental farce where it's like we're making the government a lot of money by getting married and all this There are couples like that. Yeah, and then like if a girl can understand it's like, you know what? We can just love each other and not have to get married. That's the nicest thing ever It's like wow, we don't have to spend a shit ton of money to prove we love each other A long time. Yeah, after 10 years. I was kidding. What? I got your 10 years. I don't want to see each other anymore That's just the thing like I keep hearing love is a chemical imbalance or not chemical involves a chemical reaction in your brain That lasts maximum four years. So you might love them now and then four years. You're like, oh shit Wow, there's an expiration date on love. Yeah, fuck. Well, that's why you gotta figure out absolutely everything you know about your That's the thing you never know if you're gonna fall in or out of love with somebody Yeah, I'll just throw this out there real quick to end this particular topic about love But if a little wisdom if you're ever wondering do I love someone or do I still love someone? The answer is no. Yeah, no if you're already asking the question Then the answer is already there's another test just go in the bathroom and jerk it and then come and then that'll your mind Will be 100% ready love you like boy. I don't love her. I'm just horny. What love is a battlefield

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:43.834 --> 0:43:47.175]: 
  You're supposed to marry. That to me I think is a lot more symbolic than memorable.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:49.977 --> 0:43:50.955]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:44:26.460 --> 0:44:28.350]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:56.286 --> 0:45:57.079]:

  Um... Hmm. I can't say this on national television. I can't say it on national television. That's the thing. It's so bad that I can never tell anyone about it. I think that's the best thing. Now everyone's got like at least fucking three of them. What's the most perverted thing you did as a child that you couldn't be held accountable for? That's the thing. I can't say it. It's still bad. The one I'm thinking of was a kid. It's still bad. I can't say it. I think I already said it once in the podcast. I was a kid, but I was still able to read. I think it was like 12 and it was on an international flight. And I was reading Value of the Horses, the sequel to Clan of the Cave Bears. And I got really horny and was chewing a big wad of gum. And I went into the bathroom, the airplane bathroom, this tiny little thing. And I brought in the page that I was reading where it got really hot and heavy. It was caveman sex. And I wrapped the gum around my wiener and jerked off with a wad of gum around my dick. That's not that bad at all. That's not that bad? It's not that bad. You don't even notice stuff we did. Yeah, yeah. That's the thing. I can't tell you because when I was younger, I didn't know what I did. Uh, can I tell a true story, but it's not bad. It's just funny. When I was 11, I went on holiday to America with my mom and dad. We stayed at their friend's house and they had porn on their computer. I was watching it. And I got super horny and I ran up to the room of Stainin. And I started drawing like me fucking like people. I'm like, like... I used to do that too. No, I know, right? But I was like... You're a loser. I know, right? I was like 11. I was like drawing horrible, like fucking insanely stupidly bad pictures of me. You're like right.

  And that's the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:41.174 --> 0:46:41.933]: 
  What's the most...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:44.717 --> 0:46:45.949]: 
  That's the thing.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:45.949 --> 0:46:49.037]: 
  I can't say it's still bad. I can't say it's still bad.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:14.991 --> 0:47:19.497]: 
  That's not that bad at all. That's not that bad. You didn't even notice stuff. We did.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:19.497 --> 0:47:20.914]: 
  You get it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:28.694 --> 0:47:29.082]:

  I dropped it at the bottom of the river with a brick over it. No you didn't! Yeah, no I did. No you didn't! This sounds crazy, but I was like, I took a knife and I chiseled holes in it so it would sink. And I took a brick and I tied it with rope. This is when I was leaving my dad's house for the last time. I did this before he got home. I was like, I'm leaving. I don't want him finding this one day when he has a kid that moves in and gets my room. And I buried it at the bottom of the water. And I'm sure if I went back there today, I could bring it back up. You could. We should go and go get it. Yeah absolutely, I just bring it back. I would love- I just fucking dropped this like seaweed box, but who was three? Let's put it on Jabbay. Let's fucking make it a thing. He's like dilapidating like rotting pictures and be like, peach fucking dates. You guys ever play a game called Sextris? No. What's that? You guys ever know what Sextris is? No. It was Tetris, but it was called Sextris, but it was like Tetris, but all the pieces were made of people, naked people, and you would combine them like you would with Tetris. Is this like a rom hack? What's that? Is this like a rom hack? It was just like an online game. I think I- It's like a game. I played that around the time Snood came out. Yeah, it was in college. So it was like- I used to have a rom hack of late 90s. Yeah, it was like late 90s, early 2000s, I think. No. Anyways, so if you could just imagine a bunch of pieces like L shaped, naked people, whatever, and then you could combine them and they would go and they'd disappear. That's cool. But essentially, so I guess the references lost, but anyways, if you haven't played Sextris, Google it, it's there. But essentially, I had a drawing when I was a kid that was that it was like this. It was just this ongoing project that I had where I just had a couple of people like like in sexual positions, either what you couldn't really see dicks or anything like that. But over time, I literally just kept adding on to the pile and like I'd add some underneath. I could never add any on top, but I started in the center of the page, so it didn't matter. And I just kept adding people like over time. I mean, I don't know. It was just like occasionally I'd whip it out and just draw a person here or there. What? But it ended up being like this entire fucking page or just all these people fucking like they were small, like tiny little people, you know, like they look like little Lego people almost. Like I couldn't really draw very well. But that was about as far as I went into it, about with the sex drawings. Like Gumby's horse pal, like characters like that. Yeah, which is a whole fucking like a quilt of human fuckery.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:50:51.025 --> 0:50:52.493]: 
  No you didn't.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:52.493 --> 0:50:55.210]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:24.623 --> 0:51:25.686]: 
  I would drop this like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:27.492 --> 0:51:30.951]: 
  We'll put it on Travis. Let's fucking make it a thing.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:29.550 --> 0:51:30.546]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:59.149 --> 0:52:01.444]: 
  Yeah, it was in college. I knew.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:52:01.444 --> 0:52:02.980]: 
  So it can be called like it's late.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:52:04.532 --> 0:52:05.933]: 
  early 2000s I think.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:01.671 --> 0:53:01.924]: 
  like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:03.240 --> 0:53:03.527]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:53:10.935 --> 0:54:32.104]: 
  This is good times. See, we're all just a bunch of horn dogs, what's he saying? Everyone's horn dogs. We were built to be horn dogs. Everyone is just a horny fuck and anyone who denies it is a liar. That's why there's that statistic. Anita Spartan, just sneezing. Circassian? Yeah, the one who said that all men are rapists. Rapists that are toxic. Yeah, it was 10 out of 10 men will rape everyone, or everything, even inanimate objects. One out of seven girls play games, 100% of men are rapist toxins. It's hard to be a guy. It is. You know what it is? It's hard to be a white cis male in this civilization. You know what? You know what? You know what's even worse? It's like we're eating the throat. Not getting to rape people. Yeah, obviously, but like I feel hurt being white in this world where other white people talk down to me and they say, hey, whitey, there's your fountain. Hey, whitey, there's your bathroom. We're segregating ourselves into a new civilization. It's true. I would say that like it is kind of frustrating that I just can't rape all the time because it is on my mind. And societally, it's not all right. I literally, as a man, have been built to just walk up to things and molest the fuck out of them. You've ever had like- And on a daily basis, minute to minute, you know, guys have sexual thoughts like every 30 seconds. You know, maybe I'm like overactive, but Jesus Christ, every second of the day I'm trying not to just stick my dick in something. Yeah, guys, make sure I just to like rape everybody and it's not fair to say you're

 SPEAKER_01 [0:53:15.036 --> 0:53:17.145]: 
  We were built to be horned-oves.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:53:42.660 --> 0:53:44.500]: 
  It is. This civilization. You know what?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:46.643 --> 0:53:48.752]: 
  It's like we're not getting to the people.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:53:55.064 --> 0:53:55.283]:

Did you learn this from Jordan D? 66 yes, you use your crystals Your body you know the old people will lead you out of your flesh So you can float above your body and go chase down children and rape them men think men think about two things rape and toxins It's true. Let's stop talking about the the qualities of rape. Let's get into the real meat Let's talk about the way our fucking society is heading so we have streaming Yeah, we had five nights at Freddy's This is the future this is where we go from there How do we evolve what is the next big big horrible stupid thing that I think the next well as far as streaming is concerned I think the next thing we're gonna get to is people just streaming their day-to-day lives Once Google Glass comes out and people can like see through other people's eyes I think people will just have full-blown channels where it's just their life 24 7 that will be the point where I can't take it anymore I'm just gonna quit the internet because I feel like there's enough lawyers out there who want to watch and there's enough Exhibitionists who want to show and there are some look if there's channels dedicated to people just like eating Doritos or watching trailers to movies There's gonna be the whole like this is my life. This is my wife my kids my job My lunch my shit break. I think yeah, I think movie theaters You know in the previews like video previews and stuff before you watch a movie. Yeah I think that space is gonna be bought up for like YouTube stars like people are like hey check out our prank videos or hey I'm a up-and-coming artist check out my music well YouTube You know you to be a comedian on the big screen. Well, or I've definitely seen weird I've seen the print ads. I've seen the print ads for the YouTube stuff I'm like bus stops instead of getting movie previews that stuff we've gotten for like years. Yeah, it's gonna dissolve into TV commercials We're gonna see like new kids toy that glows and stuff and it's just like are you saying sky plays Minecraft or sky does minecraft is gonna be he's gonna be in the next Pixar showing yes Yeah, it's gonna be the preview to the movie man Pixar is gone. They are done. What are they doing now? What if fucking trash like what with the Disney stuff? What the fuck Chris I hate Pixar first day have you seen their YouTube page?

I've never seen it It's what watch it there. They're marketing is fucking putrid.

So wait, he made those, right? But when you look at it, it doesn't- it looks like a bunch of interns No, do- Fucking threw shit at a wall. They were like, hey, let's just- Do you know what's fascinating is? We- me, Chris, and Aaron were watching it. Yeah. And it was like, we were literally like, these are people? This is someone who's like saying like, the joke is a Scottish man is watching a famous TV show. Yeah. You write that on paper? Yeah. And then you do it. And that's the joke. He's Scottish, and he's watching like fucking Grace Anatomy. Right. And he's talking about it. He's like, oh, don't you don't you- Yeah, no, I saw- I remember watching it, yeah. But it's just like, this isn't funny! I don't understand it! There's no joke! It's like stereotype humor. Yeah, it's two people talking. That's what it is usually at the time. I remember there was this one with like the monkey. Actually this guy meant like this monkey at an airport and they fucked him because of a guy with sex with a monkey that's a AIDSist man. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You should probably get yourself tested. It was so-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:21.972 --> 1:02:23.659]: 
  Yes, if you want to like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:27.912 --> 1:02:30.544]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:35.877 --> 1:02:36.501]: 
  They were like, hey.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:36.501 --> 1:02:37.176]: 
  Okay, let's just-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:40.889 --> 1:02:41.175]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:49.140 --> 1:02:49.529]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:02:51.182 --> 1:02:51.520]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:02:59.670 --> 1:03:01.949]: 
  Yeah, no, I saw I remember watching it. Yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [1:03:03.045 --> 1:03:03.265]: 
  I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:06.319 --> 1:03:06.825]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:03:16.343 --> 1:03:23.042]: 
  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, and he's like oh you should probably get yourself tested. It was so dry and just yeah, okay

 SPEAKER_03 [1:03:20.832 --> 1:10:20.327]: 
  Yeah, okay I know what you're saying that a guy had sex with a monkey. That's how AIDS came, but it's not a joke There was just a lot of them. There was just like a guy that was standing there It was like the awkward guy in the room when he's just standing you just like I feel weird I mean, I feel like they just dug up a bunch of skits that never were meant to see the light of day Yeah, they were then just threw them all together Remove yeah, it was a huge Burger King advert really If you would tell that to him you'd be like I make more money than you that's the thing He's like super ridiculously talented at like singing and stuff Oh, yeah, he's really talented guy and like family guy season one is like he can do a lot of great voices Yeah, I go back and see certain cartoons or certain movies and I'm like he fucking voiced that yeah He brought all these like really good old cartoons that were on Cartoon Network And yeah voice he's a really good voice like he's a really good singer and he just does that so I think the thing with family Guy is that he's not even really involved anymore. I don't think I mean I think he voices stuff. Yeah, but I feel like as someone with his name on the show Like he'd be like in the booth or in the studio recording lines And he just look at the script and say what the fuck is this like well I'm just so surprised he hasn't like you know what I mean like just guys guys guys look I know I stepped away for a while I put this in your hands and I'm working on other things right now and you know, it's not my baby anymore But what the fuck is going on sometimes after super I have the suspicion that like characters like Brian He specifically wrote them to be Republicans and yes, no absolutely like project himself into those and that's why the show becomes even worse He is just Brian. Yeah. Yeah, he's like a writer like for instance, too. He's like in the show tunes I think Brian is extremely liberal. He's all about like feminism and stuff like that One episode where he becomes a Republican. He well then it's for in that scenario. It's because he's not normally Where Brian used to be the voice of reason he actually just became the one note of topics going on like he became the liberal He became the feminist he became the social they like all became this horrible character It's just that none of them have any humanity left and they're all just like they'll let each other die and like not care It's fucking hard to watch and like Meg is just like a desperate loser She's like the joke. She's a running gag It's like Meg walks into the room and that's what you're Spirited yeah, it's just like you watch a single episode now and it's just like this mean spirited just deluded cartoon show What it used to be it's just like who are these characters? It's almost like they parodied themselves so nobody could parody them because it's gone It's literally got what would really be a family guys What happens with every show by the way it just turns into a parody of itself after a certain point I think South Park parodied family guy really well. Yeah, that was good the manatee episode fucking Manatee would just like Yeah, yeah, I would agree with that actually just Randy Marish being a big idiot every episode I think South Park has a lot of episodes where you can kind of see it coming from a mile away What they're doing and then it becomes predictable and sale you guys remember when scrub season one was like this really like nice like light-hearted like Kind of dramatic like yeah, and it's just turned into this like fucking I like scrubs at first Like that Same Is J.D. in scrubs You know this isn't the first time you've been confused about Zach Braff's identity. Yeah, like they all turned into weird parody He said he looked like me though, you know, it's interesting that we say it because we just shed and I we wanted we went on a little movie date together and We put on the human centipede three We needed we needed some entertainment. There's a third one some good Lawls some tears There's a third one. It was a parody of itself completely ridiculous And it became clear that they did it it was almost like we were both trying to like figure out what the strategy was behind this like Why are they doing this director himself shows up? Oh, yeah, I wrote this movie And he's like oh, it's the big it's the big director guy like this We love your movies and they kept like flashing the DVDs like it's always you gotta watch DVD I know it a really good And it was like they were purposely parodying it so nobody else could cuz Like the second the first the second one you you say you like the second one. Yeah, would you recommend the tiny bone? No, okay, you may enjoy the third one. It is it is such a bizarre I mean, I guess they're all bizarre But this one was clearly like just rando humor the whole fucking time She was the actor the main actor was the doctor from the first one and the secondary main actor was the doctor I from the second one. There's something I don't like they're both kind of shitty But I just like the atmosphere the movies is like this is a totally different atmosphere. It's colorful. It's like vibrant colors They talk a lot like they all talk a whole lot. Yes, there is a human centipede Yeah, human caterpillar that means like no No, no legs There's a part of the second movie that made me kind of just be like, okay That's too much one that the baby falls under the the break of the car and she puts her fuck down and squashes her newborn baby It's like come on You know those movies those three movies I respect them because the first movie in the second movie third one They all have a completely different tone and a completely different style Yeah, that's why I kind of really respect that that they they're not a bad horror trilogy They're not great. They're not good. No, they're terrible movies. Yeah, but there are there are things about I mean They're they're embedded in people's minds. You know what it's like. You know what it's like It's a I wouldn't in no way regard this it's like but it's like evil that where the first one set like this like weird tone Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then the second one perfect example Yes, because the second movie was a very different movie But it still kind of had it but it was still and then army of darkness and then army of nonsense Absolutely, that's a lot that's very much a good analogy But the humans end to be this comes from like kind of funny to just complete dark and no humor Exactly very funny. Well, they funny like they're trying. Yeah. Yeah. I think they're trying to be very funny They're trying to be I'm not saying I thought yeah parts of it I mean sometimes you're just laughing like is this actually happening right now Here's the part where he screams at an eagle. Yeah, he's just screaming and the eagle is flying to just fill the eagle Why he's screaming? I want to know something right? So just say something just saying like Mick went like missing for like six months, right? He came back and he had those like scars around his like face And he was just completely shallow of his former self and if you found out that he was stitched to a man's anus It was forced to eat shit for a few months, right? Yeah, would you still hang around make if that had happened? Yeah, and hang out with him even more. No, you would you're a liar. No, okay, Corey Corey that happens to make right? He comes back. He's a shell. He's he's got these big fucking scares You can't ignore when you look him in the face and would you talk to him every single time every single time you're like? Shit guys, I gotta go take a dump you you feel yeah, you feel like you can't say that around me anymore The first thing I would say is I would be like hey Mick why so serious

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:12.533 --> 1:08:13.377]: 
  Bizarre

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:06.179 --> 1:09:10.448]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then the second one. This is a perfect example. Yes, because the second movie was a very different one.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:10.448 --> 1:09:11.157]: 
  different movie.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:12.996 --> 1:09:16.202]: 
  and then army of darkness, totally different movie. And then army of darkness, nonsense.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:17.147 --> 1:09:18.631]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:29.939 --> 1:09:30.394]: 
  Parts of it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:36.452 --> 1:09:38.528]: 
  He's screaming.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:37.836 --> 1:09:37.953]: 
  We're

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:42.779]: 
  It's awesome, right?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:09:59.115 --> 1:09:59.419]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:00.584 --> 1:10:01.005]: 
  No, you won't.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:01.005 --> 1:10:01.630]: 
  Would?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:10.050 --> 1:10:10.455]: 
  everything

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:14.286 --> 1:10:14.674]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:16.193 --> 1:10:17.307]: 
  The first thing I would say

 SPEAKER_03 [1:10:21.795 --> 1:12:16.157]: 
  And then your face would morph into the troll face, man. And you'd sing troll-a-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. It's another thing I always wondered about, though, is like, if one of your friends got to form to the point where it's like, it kind of ruins any, like, hanging out with them, would you be that horrible friend and just stop talking to them? That's the theme of a number of things. There was a book by the guy who did Fight Club, and I think, what was it called? Something monster? Why are you looking at me like that, Shane? Anyways, think of what could horribly happen to you. Well, no, essentially, this person- The face gets ripped off by an assistant point. Yeah, yeah. The main protagonist of this story is like a model or like an actress, like a famous actress, and she's got like the supermodel boyfriend or something. Yeah. And then she gets in like this terrible accident and like her face gets burnt or something, and like everyone, like, it's not flat-out said like, oh my god, we can't hang out with you. But all of a sudden, like, the boyfriend ends up dating her best friend, and then eventually, like, she can't get any more acting roles, and then like her whole life just goes down the toilet because of this one accident that happened. But that actually kind of happened in Vanilla Sky as well with Tom Cruise. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, like, his role, like, he's like this famous dude, everybody loves him, blah, blah, blah, and he gets one, like, something happens to his face, and now all of it- This actually loops back to the whole discussion about looks. But all of a sudden, you know, people can't work with him and like all this kind of stuff. Yeah, so I could see why if an accident happened to someone, I would expect better from you guys, but, you know, it- You hear about that lady who got her face like ripped off by the chimpanzee, right? And like, I read that like, nobody goes to visit her, like, nobody, like, she gets super lonely, and it's like, why would people not visit her? Like, this is because she's just like- Chris, would you visit her? I don't- I don't- That's the thing, like, if that happens to somebody and nobody visits them and you're the only one to visit them, then they become dependent on you, and then- Yeah, that's true. And then you're kind of stuck in it, and nobody wants to be stuck anywhere. That's true. Chris, if you- Chris, we started a Kickstarter to get you out there, to get you a trip to fly out to the gorilla lady, to the gorilla face-rip lady. With- With Mitch!

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:21.930 --> 1:10:24.006]: 
  and then your face would move.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:10:24.664 --> 1:10:25.002]: 
  Peace, man.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:25.002 --> 1:10:29.609]: 
  that he sings for the Lord. Hey, thanks for coming.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:46.990 --> 1:10:47.429]: 
  Anyways

 SPEAKER_02 [1:10:49.977 --> 1:10:52.440]: 
  This person gets ripped off by him. Yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:52.440 --> 1:10:53.453]: 
  The main protagonist of the game.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:22.748 --> 1:11:24.385]: 
  Yeah, yeah, like he's full like he's

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:04.277 --> 1:12:04.952]: 
  Yeah, it's true.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:08.850 --> 1:12:09.120]: 
  크리스마스

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:17.237 --> 1:12:31.446]: 
  Serious lady It's such a horrible truth though But put yourself into that situation if you were like the centerpiece of a human centipede Yeah for two months and then you got rescued by the slot team and would you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:31.446 --> 1:12:35.648]: 
  want people to come visit you and talk to you? That's the thing, I would just be like...

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:33.218 --> 1:17:09.023]: 
  That's the thing I'm asking it's like still the same me. I just eat shit for you're not the same you you've been fucking like I'm turn into a human son of you know not just that you're like you but then where do you draw the line though? That's what I mean here We're talking about like face rips from gorillas and ass eating shits from human centipedes something horrible is happening You're not the same person anymore But what about what about if you know a family member of yours died or you know you got divorced because of some crazy thing like You know just I mean where where's the line? I really think it depends on what happens to the person and how they deal with it if I was part of a human centipede I came back. I was like hey guys. What's up? You're like dude. Did you get I was like yeah, dude totally sucked But you know what you know what life goes on trying to forget about it. Yeah You know I realized I realized guys while I was sitting there eating Bruno's big Dumpy poops I Sat there and I had to justify life in some way. Otherwise. I just fucking kill myself You know what in life. We're all eating shit. We are all in every everybody else We're eating the shit of their bad day. We're eating the shit of their imaginations. We're eating the shit of the government We're eating the shit of Commercialism all the time. Yeah, and then Mick and then I people finish you're like you gonna flush that or yeah No, right, so that's exactly you'd have to make a joke of it Someone take a dump they come out of the toilet and you'd be like leave any for me see like there's I mean The other situation that comes out of what you're saying is just like you could come back and you'd be like look Something fucking horrible happened to me, but yeah, I love a way I got it. I got a perfect scenario for you. Okay, right after this right? Okay? Just say you come back like yeah, no everything's cool, right? But but society will still always treat you like oh you're the poor person You like got fucking pooped on his mouth and you shout into another poor lady's mouth Yeah, and people will always forever treat you like that So would that not just like make you really angry if people keep doing that to you I don't think they would though. Can I get on even if it did? I think your job then is to not let it bother you and and to and to be like hey listen I know where you're gonna go with this. We don't need to talk about it or you know what? Yeah, it's true That's the guy who I was but guess what I'm good, you know like you just have to constantly remind people It's like when people make memes of you guys or something like that It's like dude, please stop but at the same time it's just like you know like it's not gonna ruin your day But it's like you educate people like hey guys, we're kind of done with the Nazi thing You know what I mean like you can stop now, you know, but it's not like you just sit there and take it I mean if I was experienced human centimim I'd use my newfound fame to go try out for Ellen Generate and then I would go on Ellen generate. I'd be like I fucking hated you as Dory Leave you get free knives though you get free knives and you get a nice blender You get a bunch of nice shit from I know I would come in and I would say that and I'd be like That's the dude who ate shit as a human centipede Yeah, he told her to her face that she fucking sucked his Dory this dude You know what you were like in the other said for six months. I was eating I was eating shit out of a dirty ass swamp ass, okay, but you know what I would rather go back to the human centipede Then watch your show Let's go to something a little more I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to ask this Chris you strike me as a secretly talented cocksucker Okay, so like you could as they say wax a mean cock right so Paul wax the pole Imagine if someone if like this big black guy, right and he would be like Chris up my deck I'm not saying you do that But you would you would you just be one of those guys and you suck his dick and he filmed you secretly and put it online Oh, no, would you then still want people to talk to you or would you just want to be like? I don't want to know anybody Personally if that happened to me the best thing you can do is completely own it just like right so Yeah, so then it's the same thing with every other situations like I've been turned into a human centipede so Yeah, but he's looking at it. Yeah, because the worst thing that can ever happen you after that won't be as bad So like like you know, I look like a fucking super villain You always hear stories about people going blind and it sounds like a really horrible thing But they always seem like much happier because your other senses get enhanced like spider-man the real question is What are things that would be worse than being in a human centipede having your ears eyes and tongue cut out? Yeah, but the but see the whole point of the human centipede is that it didn't mangle you you know what I mean? You were able to mangle you didn't do it. Oh really? It like ruins your asshole. It means you have to wear diapers for the rest of your life It means you'll never be able to walk into a grocery store that people looking at your face be like And they also cut out the things

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:36.795 --> 1:12:37.369]: 
  I just said that you just...

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:43.259 --> 1:12:45.334]: 
  But then where do you draw the line though? That's what you're doing.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:52.827 --> 1:12:53.451]: 
  But what about

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:09.128 --> 1:13:13.380]: 
  where you keep it set up, and I was like, yeah dude, totally sucked. But you know what?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:15.659 --> 1:13:16.047]:

I'm just... No, no, it was a man. How did he do that then? He just, he actually just decided he wanted a pussy. So did he just gave him an operation and it worked? He was a guy first? Yeah. That works? Yeah, he just wanted a pussy. And then wait... He wanted to be, his thing is being fucked by men, so it's simple. Oh, okay. You slice up the shaft of the penis, you grab it by like, you know, the shaft, and you wrap it around into itself into a pussy. Oh. And then tie it in a balloon knot and then you're set. He's ready. You tie it into like a little giraffe balloon doll. It's like tying your shoes. It's like, pull the rabbit ears through the hole, pull the end, you never forget. That's how you tie your shoes.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:37.161 --> 1:18:40.097]: 
  En voel ons nog zo booster

 SPEAKER_03 [1:18:39.929 --> 1:18:43.624]: 
  That's what the doctors are doing. Use a stapler or a don. That's what all the kids are doing.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:18:42.696 --> 1:18:43.118]: 
  So all the kids

 SPEAKER_03 [1:18:44.907 --> 1:21:34.855]: 
  You're good. How beautiful. I was saying like with a lot of them, with a lot of like, you know, there was this one comedian who was talking about gay guys and just kind of like the perception that, oh, they're these effeminate guys. And I love, he went in this little rant and I loved it, but it was basically like, hey, so what do you like? You know, it's like this guy asking another guy, he's like, oh yeah, I like women. I like them nice and small and soft and silky and, and you know, smooth and cuddly and pretty and they smell good. It's like, what about you, gay guy? It's like, I fuck dudes. And there was like, there's nothing more masculine. You know what I mean? If you want to talk about effeminate, like, oh yeah, I want this pretty little princess to stick my wiener in versus like, give me a big hairy motherfucking dude. You know, like he just fucking lifted a barrel over his head and threw it down the hall. Now this sweaty man, we're going to fuck. This is going to get fucking, you know, I want this guy to wreck me or I'm going to wreck him. And it's like, I don't know, that's pretty manly. There's probably somebody out there who thinks it's like the epitome of masculinity to go out into the wild, find a bear and literally wrestle the bear to the ground and then violate it sexually. Actually in the age of wood, never in the world would you wrestle a bear to the ground. I think what's way more manly is wrestling a silverback to the ground and fucking raping it. Dude, a bear or a silverback? Come on, man. Yeah, with a bear, you can, a silverback? Come on. I don't know. Silverback or Zizzley bear? Grizzly bear or silverback? I think the fucking bear would fuck up the silverback. I don't know. I mean, the silverback has the trees, right? I mean, it has the ability to be more noble. Silverback could pick up the fucking bear and throw it on the ground. Are the silverbacks like the old ones that can't really do much? They're the Alphas because they're supposed to protect everybody. They fight for that role and when they're too old to be protectors, another alpha will come and it will challenge it. They're like nature's bodybuilders. Yeah, and if he wins, then he becomes the new alpha. I see, I did not know that. Yeah, a lot of animal tribes are like that. Like they'll just have a leader for the longest time until a younger one comes and kicks his ass. Yeah. What if you go into the hood and choose like the most meanest, biggest black man and wrestle him and rape him? Is that manly? I don't think people would fuck with you. It would be pretty manly. Yeah, but you could say that about any place. If I walked into the fucking Google office right now, marched right up into the main office into the fucking CEO's office, some bodyguard security guy came over and I fucking just bitch slapped him. I went right up to the guy, grabbed him. It's a fucking chair meeting. It's like all the chairmen are there. I grab him and drag him onto this long table, flip him over, pull his plaid pants down and fucking stick my dick in his ass. I don't know. Like, and if anyone tried to challenge me and I was able to defeat them and then I stood up and I said, I'm the new fucking CEO.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:25.052 --> 1:19:25.356]: 
  Versus.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:19:55.461 --> 1:19:56.507]: 
  Actually in the asian

 SPEAKER_01 [1:19:56.507 --> 1:19:57.790]: 
  Just rape the bitch.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:07.527 --> 1:20:08.235]: 
  Come on, man.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:10.851 --> 1:20:11.948]: 
  I don't know who do you

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:11.948 --> 1:20:14.192]: 
  I think we're silverback or zizzleberry

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:16.960 --> 1:20:17.939]: 
  Who's gonna fuck each other first?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:20:30.696 --> 1:20:31.945]: 
  Because there's supposed to protect everybody.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:31.945 --> 1:20:33.767]: 
  They fight for that role.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:40.855 --> 1:20:40.872]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:56.903 --> 1:20:58.455]: 
  and wrestle him and rape him.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:07.517 --> 1:21:07.956]:

I've heard of two toilets Yeah famous Japanese ones where the squats. Yeah, this quad holes and also just ours American ones No, India's got a really good one too. You shit right on the beach Have you not seen a video on YouTube or it's like This I do is like, you know, I've got a toilet in my house But I am one of the very few here in India and she goes out onto a beach and there's this guy's like I will show you where we all take a Like brings me out onto the beach and there's like hundreds of people just squatting taking shits like full view and The waters like coming in pulling out the shits And it's like do they at least draw like a line in the sand to delineate where you know Stand around any sort of ship piles the house holds the house holds are like split up based on like oh my god And then it's like a part where he's like if you run into one of your friends or someone you respect all you can do is look away

 SPEAKER_02 [1:22:45.443 --> 1:22:49.965]: 
  Google ads. It scares you shit while you're taking it. What do you mean, why Germans?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:23:29.402 --> 1:23:30.887]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:10.814 --> 1:24:11.607]: 
  That was a shit.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:24:15.420 --> 1:24:15.960]: 
  And then it's like a

 SPEAKER_03 [1:24:22.255 --> 1:25:15.529]: 
  Yes, like YouTube video? Yeah, and you, like in the YouTube video, they don't censor, you see shits coming out of their assholes and landing on the beach and stuff. When I was in Taiwan, we went to a Buddhist monk temple, and what they had was this trough. So it was like this like concrete trough, essentially, and at the very top of the trough was a little gate. And what would happen is this trough was maybe like 30 feet long. It was pretty long, in about five feet deep, but it was only about half a foot wide. So it wasn't very wide, but you put both your feet on both sides of this trough, don't fall in. You squat down and you take a shit. And you can look down the trough, and there's just piles of shit going all the way down. And when it gets too filled up, you pull this chain and the water comes down and flushes it down, I guess, a hill. But essentially, it's like the trough. So we've got squats, we've got like the squat toilets, we've got the normal American toilets, we have German shelf toilets. Toilet troths? Yeah. I would hate to fucking fall into that thing.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:25:17.267 --> 1:25:55.658]: 
  Rape isn't funny because rape isn't a joke. In fact, it's super duper serious. Studies have proven that even joking about rape is equal to, if not more, rapey than the act of rape itself. The unraped truth? There's never been a funny rape joke, just like there's never been a funny joke about terrorism, racism, sexism, ageism, or even rapism. We may not be able to stop rape, but together we can stop Paul Blart's Mall Cop 3. Join the movement at BannedTheBlart.com.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:25:59.624 --> 1:31:22.814]: 
  I want to hear a story. I want someone tell me a story. I got a great story, Mick. Recently, well actually it was a few months ago, I went to Hershey Park with two, I went with Niall, my friend Jack, and my friend Caitlin, right? Yeah. So we're walking around Hershey Park, having fun on roller coasters, when this kid runs up to me, this normal looking kid who looks about 12, runs up to me and he's like, ha, the teenager, and I thought he was making fun of the way I looked, because I was wearing like stupid Halo t-shirts and my hair was long and I looked like a dumpy idiot. Yeah. And I was like, yeah, he ran away, right? So I was like, that was fucking weird. So basically he was like all your fans, but go on. Yeah, I was like that kid must have known who I was or something. Oh. Right, so then he was gone and then I was having more fun on the roller coasters with my friends. Then I ran into the kid again and he went, making fun of me, right? Oh, no. And I was like, what the fuck? And then I noticed there was this like black kid behind him like laughing and like an egging him on. So I was like, OK, these kids are like trying to fuck with me, right? Yeah. And then this kid like walks up to me and he like grabs my t-shirt. He went, right? And I put my hand on his chest and I like pushed him back. And he like he kind of like went back a few steps. He was like, get away from me. And then his friend went, hey, this guy's pushing him, right? And then at this point, a bunch of other kids ran over, one of them being a lumbering eight foot tall fat retard who was like, what are you doing to my friend? Right? And I was like, oh, no, push me, right? And dude, it gets gets great. You you kicked the bees nest. Oh, it gets better. So I'm standing there trying to diffuse this ridiculous situation when my my look like a god, my friend Jack came over who is six foot three built like a tank. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And he was just standing behind me just like, what the fuck is going on? Chris, what what the fuck have you done? I'm like, I'm doing shit. I was fucking pushing away this kid is fucking with me. Like I'm not going to let him just push me and fuck with me. Right. So I was getting mad. And then all these kids are walking towards me and I was just like, OK, this is bad. And then I said out loud, why do I always attract these fucking freaks? Right. And then this big tall lumbering kid. It's like, if you say that about my friend again, I'm going to smash your fucking face in. And he was like, he looked like he looked his face was 10 years old, but he was like six foot five. Right. And I was like, what the fuck am I supposed to do? I can't hit them. And then the mother came over and she's like, what did you do to my son? And I was just like, I pushed him away from me because he was grabbing at me. Right. And then the kids, the little fucking shits were like, he was pushing him around. Right. And I was like, oh, fuck me. And then this big fucking tall, built black dude came over. He's what the fuck is going on here? And then the fucking Christ, my friend, Katelyn was like, your son was like pulling on my friend's shirt. Right. And she's like, oh, and then my friend, Jack is like, oh, he's autistic. And then she's like, yes. And it's like, yeah, he was pulling on my friend's shirt. Like, and she's like, I'm sorry, we'll like leave. So all these little kids were egging on this like autistic kid to pull on my shirt. And I pushed him away and it got the entire fucking scene mad at me. Wow. And then everybody was mad at me for the rest of the day at the end. Do you think they do that? Do you think they bait that kid into going around? Yes, they were egging him on to like fuck with people. And then I like, I didn't push him hard. I put one hand on his chest and just pushed him away. I would have picked him up. And he started saying, he was like swinging at me as shit. He was going, yeah, like swinging his arms at me. I was like, you fucking asshole. Why do you think the other kids thought you were an easy target? Because it looked like a dumpy teenager. You know, you have these stories, though, like when you were in Dublin, you said like a bunch of kids surrounded you and started like poking you and making fun of you and trying to steal your camera and shit. Yeah, it was over Christmas. And before that, I got punched in the face for literally no reason. Walking through Dublin, too. I honestly also, we had a lumbering beast once hypothetically in our presence that threatened to beat your ass. Yeah, you know what I think it is? It's because I've got this fucking long blonde hair and I just look like a fucking teenager that wants to be picked on. You have one long. You have that you have that punchable that punchable. And all fucking this is a baby. This is like fucking a porn. I honestly, I think I just look like an easy target because I am an easy target. I wonder if I don't think you look like an easy target, though. Half brain, lobotic retard walked up to me and he was like, do who do who I'd be like, it's like a scare. Are you trying to say that you'd fight fire with fire? Yeah, it worked. I was like, I was minding my own business. I'm always minding my own business, having a good time when these people start fucking with me. And it's like the worst part was everybody was like pampering him. Like once I pushed him, all these little shitheads try turning the situation on me. I was just literally trying to get there. There is no way it was the first time. Yeah, there's no way it was the first time. Honestly, though, the parent comment, I'd been like, this little shit just started. This is so fucked up that you can be standing there and then a bunch of kids can start fucking with you and you push him away just to get him out of your face. And then everybody will the fact that he touched you is bullshit. He was he's like a fucking grenade that they threw at you because they knew you have to respond to the old cunt of a mother was leaving her fucking autistic kid unattended to do this shit. And parents. Yeah. And you know what? At the best part at a fucking roller coaster park, you know, because that's like the safest place to just fucking let your kids run wild. He looked like really like normal, except he was acting like, you know, an autistic person. Right. But at first I thought he was just fucking with me. Like all of us. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:31:21.480 --> 1:31:21.953]: 
  Like all

 SPEAKER_03 [1:31:24.400 --> 1:32:59.609]: 
  He just had that like head on him where he's like smiling going, Ehh, you teenager. I was just like, oh, okay, thanks. So, what does that even mean? I don't fucking know. I don't think it means anything. I think at that point it doesn't matter what they're saying. No, it doesn't. Yeah. No, anytime, and I'm not saying this kid did it, but anytime I got into a fight when I was in high school, the fight always started with like the stupidest shit. Things just like, you know, I don't like your hat. Literally, like that's it. Like this is the foreplay you're gonna give me? You don't like my hat? So what? You're gonna throw it down? Yeah, that's when it started with me. Some kid was pushing me, is there any like my coat? No, no. It doesn't even matter what. If you got like an autistic kid who like goes around like trying to fuck with people and you know his friends are gonna egg him on and do it, and like, if you see like a guy pushing your kid away, are you not gonna assume that maybe your kid was doing something fucked up? Like, they were all just obviously pampering him and making him more of a force. I don't know, you know, sometimes you'd think that parents are a little bit more aware of what the hell's going on, but sometimes they do block it out. But here's the biggest red flag. She was like, what'd you do to my son? So clearly it happens. Because if she's like, oh, I'm sorry, it won't happen again. She didn't even apologize. What's going on here? It's just what did you do to my son? Immediately, what did you do? That fucking ragged old cunt didn't even apologize for like, and she knew that her kid was starting shit. She just like lets him get away with it, and that's why he does it. That's why his friends egg him on to do it. It's even on a baser level, it's like when people have kids that are crying or annoying other customers or stuff, you just see them sitting there and it's like a whole, it's just like blank. It's like they've found a way to just block it all out. Sorry, I was really mad. My old friends were like, Chris, why did you push an autistic kid?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:31:38.710 --> 1:31:38.828]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:31:52.007 --> 1:31:54.184]: 
  my hat so what you can throw down

 SPEAKER_02 [1:31:56.817 --> 1:31:57.947]: 
  No, no, isn't it?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:31:57.947 --> 1:31:59.297]: 
  It doesn't even matter what-

 SPEAKER_02 [1:32:12.325 --> 1:32:13.050]: 
  I don't know, you know.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:32:17.809 --> 1:32:19.530]: 
  They do block it out.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:32:22.281 --> 1:32:25.437]: 
  So clearly it happens because if she's like, oh.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:32:26.550 --> 1:32:28.761]: 
  Or what's going on here?

 SPEAKER_02 [1:32:31.495 --> 1:32:31.832]:
