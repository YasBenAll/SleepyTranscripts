 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:44.016 --> 0:02:48.031]: 
  That is what happened. What is this, the Lion episode? No, that's not a lion, that's true.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:46.682 --> 0:02:56.453]: 
  No, that's not a lie, that's true. It was more like, thanks, I got it today. No, I didn't. No, it was not. No, it was fucking eyes were dilated, he was just shaking. Chris goes, thanks, I got it today. And then like...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:02:50.462 --> 0:02:57.465]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:02:57.837 --> 0:03:30.659]: 
  That is true. He didn't walk away awkwardly. Yeah, yeah wait. I was explaining myself yet Explain why there's nothing else explain there is many things to explain in the world of judgment bullshit Fucking you what you write a bike some fat guy in a car drives by going ah nice legs You freak and you're like okay. I'll you use a skateboard and then they're like oh look at that skating faggot And you're like fine. I'll get a longboard and they're like look at this fucking college douche bag Where's your fucking hoop earrings retired? It's and you can't do anything when I being judged except for drive around your big fucking car And I don't know if he would like your car

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:01.144 --> 0:03:05.211]:

  If you call 12, give a shitty call to the...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:03:29.984 --> 0:03:34.101]: 
  One day like the geese were fucking bullying us for being on it remember that yeah, like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:33.578 --> 0:04:23.089]: 
  Fag, fag, fag. That's why I never wanted to ride my bike, because I had a bike, but I just didn't want to ride it, because I didn't want to be the guy riding his bike. When you're looking at somebody for the first time you're judging them, it's just natural. But when you see a guy on a longboard, and you're just finding his own business, and you stick your head at the window to be like, you're a faggot! I always, I think I never- Why did I do the warrant then? I never did bikes myself, because it's like me. So if you see me on a bike, you want to push me over. The only people you don't want to push over on a bike is some athletic guy with fucking nice legs. If you see some chubby guy with breathing heavily, going to the wall, want to get a fucking sandwich? Yeah, a cyclist with those skin tight shorts. I'm just like, I fucking hate that. No, because if I know what I'm saying, these guys are kicking my face. But that's not fair, because now I'm judging people. What? I always say that no, because if you make fun of the guy, the buff guy on the bike, he'll get off his bike and kick you in the fucking face, and cajure your face like a fucking- Yeah, that's true. With his bike and your bike on the legs. But there's fucking-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:04:10.332 --> 0:04:13.437]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:04:13.437 --> 0:04:13.774]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:04:20.760 --> 0:04:21.637]:

  with his fucking biker like, they're like, skinny

 SPEAKER_02 [0:04:24.405 --> 0:05:06.137]: 
  What I'm saying is you can't go anywhere without getting judged for something stupid Yeah, I wanna go to Wawa on my longboard because it's really fast and it gets me down Where's trench coat? Go through the glasses I used to wear a trench coat and you guys judged me for it It's because you wear your fucking trench coat cause trench coats keep you warm and the cool fucking winter They keep the blood fucking off you You remember in high school where there was like that point where you were kind of turning into an adult And everybody had cars coming of age Like certain friends in F-cards so some people still took the bus And sometimes your friends had to leave early And there was always that dread of oh shit I have to take the bus Why can't I wear a fedora and a trench coat and use my longboard to go to Wawa?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:09.529 --> 0:06:19.729]: 
  Did you see the video of that guy burning the fucking house down in the middle of the woods? He's like, he's like, this is chaos. I have a burning- He just burnt down like some little shit. There's no Minecraft video. Coy, have you seen this? This fucking guy made a series called Minecraft High, and in the finale, it's like, it's a school shooting episode. I'm not joking. Are you fucking serious? I am not joking. It's like- Is it a cartoon one? No, it's a fucking real-life gameplay through Minecraft. And he's like- What? There's like, God just said to fix things like, don't orient, Molly, we'll be safe in here. So it's- It's like, boom, boom, boom, and it's like- Fuck you and me. I swear to fucking God. Tell me this, are the gunners wearing the outfits from the Colombo? You don't see it. You don't fucking see it. So you have these- You are a liar! I swear, I will leave the fucking- I take my hat off and call you a liar! I will leave the video. Let me guess, he ends the video with, school shootings are bad. No, no, no, no, no, no, that's the bizarre thing. It's like, he's like, Emily, babe, do you hear that, babe? Boom, boom, boom, boom, and gun shots, and it says to be continued. There's no message. Good idea. He's using a fucking school mic, a school shooting mic. That is great. Could you- That's what Minecraft needed! Could you imagine being like a call-by-survive, like, I'm gonna play some Minecraft today. And you just see that, and you're like, well, I guess Minecraft is ruined now. You kind of deserved it if you were looking at Minecraft high.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:30.927 --> 0:05:31.838]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:35.939 --> 0:05:41.659]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:05.288 --> 0:11:18.434]: 
  Like four times and it worked, but I didn't do it for eight hours, but this time I crawled out and when I know that I got out of the bag and then you got when I crawled out from under there I was looking up the manager skirt accidentally because I was crawling out. Yeah accidentally also so what?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:06.182 --> 0:11:06.385]: 
  Bye!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:16.577 --> 0:11:22.230]: 
  Yeah, also, so what you just like grab a pile of clean clothes throw it on the floor and no it won't make it now

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:21.269 --> 0:11:25.791]: 
  No, it was making a nest out of it and sweating to it as you sleep. It wasn't on the floor, it was in the stock room.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:23.007 --> 0:11:24.036]: 
  What is your sleep?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:25.791 --> 0:11:29.183]: 
  and it was already like... Doesn't make it smell any better when you sweat it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:28.660 --> 0:11:35.984]: 
  I didn't I didn't sweat into it. I work you all under it. No cuz they were hung up They were hung on a rack and I

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:29.909 --> 0:11:33.790]: 
  I work under it. No cuz they were hung up

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:35.427 --> 0:11:38.093]: 
  You probably fucking drilled all over there.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:37.401 --> 0:11:45.434]: 
  Yeah, I wasn't even touching it. I wasn't even in contact. I was under how do you actually look up so would school because I didn't know She was there and she was wearing a skirt like all the time

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:38.954 --> 0:11:42.767]: 
  I wasn't even in contact I was under how do you actually wake up to would screw because I didn't know sure

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:44.084 --> 0:11:48.117]: 
  He's like, well, he's stuck his head out like a fucking cartoon character looking around a corner. And he was like, what?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:11:47.830 --> 0:11:57.769]: 
  No, I crawled out under there. She was standing there and she was wearing a skirt And I was looking up and then she saw me looking off and I was like hello, and then I got fired Did you see the flap? No, I didn't see I didn't actually see anything. He saw the bee

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:54.698 --> 0:11:55.457]: 
  Did you see the fly?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:11:57.077 --> 0:12:01.583]: 
  He saw the beef. You were like a groundhog who saw a shadow and then he shot back into your fucking mouth.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:01.279 --> 0:12:03.507]: 
  I was not, I just got fired

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:02.444 --> 0:12:10.341]: 
  Yeah, probably he did it by the way. So what animating now is a creepy gopher? The guy kept asking me. A hook-fucking hyper realistic gopher with his face on it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:10.544 --> 0:12:23.672]: 
  Then when I worked in a fast food place, the guy kept asking me to get a haircut and I was like, yep, yep, tomorrow, yep, yep, yep, yep, and I kept saying, yep, oh, it just never did, I just did not care. Well then I said, this protocol. Then he told me that I wasn't allowed to go to the bathroom and I was like, I'm going to the bathroom anyway, fuck that. And then he fired me. Now did you-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:17.378 --> 0:12:19.032]: 
  Well that's super good, that's protocol.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:23.149 --> 0:12:25.714]: 
  Now that you've learned a lesson in all this crazy story

 SPEAKER_01 [0:12:25.714 --> 0:12:32.295]: 
  Yes, Zach, I did. I learned that even if you don't want to work, you should just do it anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:31.097 --> 0:12:37.628]: 
  Yeah, yeah. Wow. Yeah. You're really, you're really at a good point. It's like a novencentral park, like, logic.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:12:31.165 --> 0:12:35.333]: 
  Yeah, yeah. Wow. Yeah. Oh, you really made a good point.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:12:38.438 --> 0:14:47.312]: 
  the fuck? Cory, get out! So you know what? Don Bluth original, look it up, you fucking bastard. Let's talk about Don Bluth's fucking corpse ass. Can I be Frank? You can be Cory. Um, I thought Don Bluth was fucking dead. Are you saying- I actually thought this dude was dead. Are you saying- are you saying a genovan central park is a bad film? Yes, but I'm also saying that I thought Don Bluth was fucking dead. I had no idea he re-crawled- He might as well be. He fucking moved the dirt and crawled out of his fucking brain. He was in- he was in a Stoneman Critic video, their fucking puppeteer's corpse was real. Did you see him get up and like walk and like stretch his bones out? It's like- it's like that horror movie, what's it called, fucking Saturdays? Were they- Did you see him get up and he like walked around, he was like popping his fucking bones? He walks like that horror movie, the mama person, down the hallway, the clickety monster, that's how he walks. That's how he's walking around to go to his tablet and fucking walk. He runs really fast to his tablet. Time to draw dragonslayer. That kickstarter fail. Yeah, well let's talk about dragonslayer, okay? I was actually at a 4x his heart transplant. I respect Don Blue that should make it like a clip, I'm just joking. I respect Don Blue for everything. But what I don't understand is this like new wave of nostalgia nonsense. There's like a wave of all like 80s, 90s stuff being rebooted or you know, like Mr. Science Theatre, Psycho-Lots 2, the dragonslayer thing. I guarantee half the people would say, I love dragonslayer, they just love the fucking video that they- I got it for free in my cereal box. Dragonslayer was fucking awful. I think the problem is that I respect a lot of the kickstarters out there. I'm not shitting at all of them at all. But I feel like some people who do have series for like the 80s or whatever, or movies or whatever, they want to bring it back. And I think that's a viable option, but they don't really look and do the specifics of it. They're in over their heads in a way. Tim Schaefer fucking- He's deliberately- He got way more of a budget than they thought. So I looked at a few hours ago. He asked for, I think it was 400,000, he got $3,300,000. So he got almost $3,000,000 more than he asked for. Let's just ignore the other fucking games he completely abandoned. So he got what he asked for plus $3,000,000. And it's still- that's a whole other fucking story. So if you do a kickstarter, are you legally obliged to make it? No. No, that's the bad thing. What? We're talking about kickstarter-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:43.349 --> 0:12:44.715]: 
  Let's talk about dark blue.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:46.487 --> 0:12:47.348]: 
  Can I be free?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:49.019 --> 0:12:49.795]: 
  I thought I had-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:12:50.841 --> 0:12:51.465]: 
  Are you saying...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:00.932 --> 0:13:01.979]: 
  He might as well be.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:04.493 --> 0:13:05.117]: 
  He was in the

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:10.349 --> 0:13:11.192]: 
  They were like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:22.583 --> 0:13:23.190]: 
  It works.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:31.139 --> 0:13:31.459]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:34.919 --> 0:13:36.015]: 
  Oh me too aw.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:37.264 --> 0:13:40.099]: 
  No, I just meant to undo everything.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:13:44.571 --> 0:13:44.588]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:52.992 --> 0:13:53.279]: 
  I can't.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:13:57.092 --> 0:13:57.936]: 
  I got it for free.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:57.936 --> 0:13:58.172]: 
  in the

 SPEAKER_03 [0:13:58.999 --> 0:13:59.573]: 
  It's real bucks.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:17.663 --> 0:14:18.017]: 
  He's the best.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:20.700 --> 0:14:22.439]: 
  I would still have a few hours.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:14:29.931 --> 0:14:32.057]: 
  $30 more than he asked for.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:34.437 --> 0:14:35.382]: 
  So he got, he could.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:42.992 --> 0:14:44.494]: 
  No. No. No. No.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:44.494 --> 0:14:44.595]: 
  That's it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:14:45.270 --> 0:14:53.269]: 
  What? We were talking about Kickstarter. So he can actually legally take the money? Yeah. And run. We were talking about... Not him. I'm not saying him. That's not what he did. Well, he did. Well, he can. Well, he can.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:14:48.561 --> 0:14:48.949]: 
  money.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:14:48.949 --> 0:20:39.224]: 
  No, we were talking about that. I'm not saying him's talking about that. Well, he's not using Kickstar. He's using fucking Fignation or some made-up website. A big example of a scam that happened was the Chester Cheetah, whatever the fuck it's called, 2. Cheetah Man 2. Cheetah Man 2? That game was them playing nostalgia. They admittedly were like, Yeah, it's a scam. Fuck you. They literally just released the game exactly how it was. That was really messed up. Same shit happened with Femme Frequency 2, where they got way more money than they thought. They put out two episodes. There's nothing to it, but Kickstarters that has kind of come up over the last years. All these Kickstarters now, where some of them, you know, people have to do what they can do. But then there's like these Kickstarters that are promoted already to begin with. They're already have like people who are ready to put millions of dollars into the Kickstarter. There's already money being pumped in, so they make it feel like, Oh no, look, this Kickstarter, we really need the money, but they're already being invested in it. It sucks because the Kickstarters who have either taken the money and ran with it, or have genuinely wanted to finish the game, but they weren't able to. Those four are the people who have actually done what they said they were going to do to the team. One of the people that did exactly what they said they were going to do was Cynine Happiness. I give props because they did everything they could. I give them props. They've been releasing stuff constantly. There's a lot of stories though of like, it even happened to me where I donated to the Kung Fury thing, and I didn't get my rewards at all. Oh yeah, that happens a lot. Now they're releasing some fucking 80s looking like CRTVs, nostalgia looking bullshit, like Kung Fury game. That looks horrible, looks like a terrible indie game. It's just hard because it just happens where... Yeah, the movie's good, but do you really want to see random laser dinosaurs shooting like fucking Amazonian women's with fucking rifles? It's a huge mess because for the people who get kind of fucked, say you need to do a Kickstarter, and you're like, I'm going to send out like 400,000 rewards now, but you don't want to do it, so you hire someone to do it. So then you hire that person, and then there are probably shit, so you fire them, and then the people that they sent the rewards out to, you can't keep track of now that you fired them or whatever. Yeah, you need someone to do such a mess. That's the curse science thing, if you think it does well, you have a fucking 400 backers, then you have to set up four things. That's why you shouldn't be an incompetent monkey with a typewriter. Well, or a big thing, the other thing that happened though was they get a John K, and it's not polite to share the other honest, but this is a situation where... You know what's fucked up about John K? He was like complaining about stuff, he's like, I don't have the money, and then fucking Miley Cyrus came to me, did a cartoon in like fucking like three weeks. He, again, not even speaking on his character or anything, just speaking solely on his Kickstarter behavior, he raised over $100,000 I think, for like a three minute cartoon. It's like, dude, that ruins it for everybody else now. That's gonna be the back of everybody's heads. I mean, I donated to something, some space document or a few years ago, three years ago. I donated to like really shitty like anime indie, like, not saying indie bad, but like people who clearly looked like they were gonna fall under, they were asking for a game that was like $100, and it looked terrible. I donated to the reward, and the thing that they were supposed to send him, he got like smashed in the mail. That's not their fault though, I mean, it sucks, but I agree. What I'm saying is, it's never been worth it for me to donate to anything. What about the AVGN movie? Unless I just wanted to support it. I donated to that, he did a lot with that budget. That budget looks double what it was worth. Really? He did a very, very big job with that budget. Yeah, he managed his budget really good. Did you see his new board James video? No. He did a finale for board James, like fucking, it was overflowing with practical effects and shit. Yeah, he's always really... It looked fucking amazing. He's always really captured that. And it was really interesting, because he pulled like an exception like story, but he did it so nicely. He like made it work. And like, I gotta give him props where like props are and stuff. He's really good at making like people like look like they're smaller and like a big, like he might gotta look at these green screens or like... Like tell your husband? They're like reporting the ground and like people were falling and it's like the ground was getting bigger and then like fucking they spun on the ground and then... Red Little Media's also really been good at doing that too. Red Little Media is always really good with their budgets. Let's get into the real deal. The real deal. The real deal. The meat of things. The juicy meat. I like to bring something up. I saw a documentary, that's a documentary I guess. It's called the Lightmare. It's about, you know what sleep paralysis is? Yes. So this filmmaker who takes a few people, like eight people about that. And they ask them what they see in their sleep paralysis. Because people have very severe sleep paralysis. And he takes what their stories are and he like makes them into films that he re-enacts it. It's good to fuck enemy. Because I've never had, well I've had it, but I've never like had it to like, I've never seen anything in that sense. It's fucking horrifying. When you guys said a story about you, there was like a hunched over like shadow person running around your room. I was in my bed staring at the wall. And then you get this sensation where you hear everything like bass drop where it goes like... And everything is like real slick. You know, you start feeling like there's shit closing in around you. But then you start hallucinating. So I hallucinated this huge, I'd have to draw it. It was like, it wasn't human at looking at all, but it had big long arms, big long, or tiny little legs at the back. And a tiny little white like face in the middle. You can draw it for this podcast. Yeah I will. And it was just like, it was at the, you know, the foot of my bed, but it was leaning in very, very slowly. While keeping its like hands and legs both on the ground. So for a just... But it was like, to me it was like nine foot tall. Like just leaning in. For people who don't know... It was like coming in to give you a kiss. For people who don't know really quickly sleep paralysis is literally just like you wake up, you're actually awake, but your body releases chemicals when you go to sleep that freezes your body. You start dreaming over real life. So you don't like sleepwalk your body. Yeah, so your body, your body like, says chemicals when you go to sleep that paralyzes your body. You get fucking hyper realistic hallucinations. Yeah, no there's no distinguishing... It's honestly when people say like, well I felt, I couldn't breathe, I felt like someone was holding me down, and I was seeing like hands strangling me. Oh my god. That happens. But that is like sleep paralysis. I used to get it every single night. You talked to this recently, I didn't know this, you had it like really bad for a long time.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:09.419 --> 0:15:11.629]: 
  That was really best of it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:14.582 --> 0:15:15.915]: 
  Despecteurs-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:15:29.567 --> 0:15:30.074]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:36.351 --> 0:15:38.444]: 
  It sucks because the kids don't...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:15:53.749 --> 0:15:57.951]: 
  They've been releasing stuff constantly.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:15:57.951 --> 0:15:58.356]: 
  always though

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:04.532 --> 0:16:06.085]: 
  Oh, yeah, não é pra zoar, né?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:12.059 --> 0:16:12.447]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:14.894 --> 0:16:17.661]: 
  It's just hard because it just happens

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:15.450 --> 0:16:16.007]: 
  because

 SPEAKER_01 [0:16:23.517 --> 0:16:26.369]: 
  I really don't

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:44.290 --> 0:16:46.214]: 
  You need someone to do this.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:50.179 --> 0:16:51.090]: 
  of poorer things.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:16:53.672 --> 0:16:55.005]: 
  Well, or a big thing.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:16:59.984 --> 0:17:00.574]: 
  어�步워

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:01.755 --> 0:17:02.481]: 
  We can live.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:17:11.204 --> 0:17:12.049]: 
  Key again.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:28.300 --> 0:17:29.532]: 
  I don't even know. Three years ago.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:37.733 --> 0:17:39.066]: 
  They were asking for a game that was like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:40.905 --> 0:17:42.289]: 
  I don't need to reward him.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:17:46.035 --> 0:17:48.887]: 
  That's not their fault though. I mean it sucks but I agree.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:57.899 --> 0:17:58.523]: 
  Really?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:17:59.215 --> 0:18:00.936]: 
  He managed his budget really good.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:00.936 --> 0:18:01.155]: 
  see

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:03.197 --> 0:18:03.248]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:08.074 --> 0:18:10.538]: 
  He's he's all looking amazing

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:11.145 --> 0:18:11.500]: 
  And it was

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:15.989 --> 0:18:16.326]:

  Like, hey husband.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:18:27.936 --> 0:18:30.585]: 
  Yeah, like reporting the ground and like people were

 SPEAKER_03 [0:18:35.496 --> 0:18:38.854]: 
  The other media has always really been good. The other media is always really good with their budgets.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:18:38.854 --> 0:18:39.411]: 
  into the rear.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:12.014 --> 0:19:12.267]: 
  What are you doing?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:19:16.452 --> 0:19:17.380]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:26.256 --> 0:19:26.779]: 
  and everything

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:44.532 --> 0:19:45.224]:

  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:52.716 --> 0:19:53.864]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:12.797 --> 0:20:13.219]: 
  research.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:13.827 --> 0:20:14.924]: 
  It's not over real life.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:16.071 --> 0:20:16.628]: 
  Yeah, so you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:19.480 --> 0:20:19.952]:

  It's honestly- Get fucked-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:20:21.488 --> 0:20:23.530]: 
  Illucinations

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:28.390 --> 0:20:28.862]:

  like god

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:33.672 --> 0:20:34.380]: 
  I used to get it every-

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:38.144 --> 0:21:03.152]: 
  I had a really bad when I was when I was a kid I saw it like the first memory of it is that I woke up and I thought my sister was in bed beside me Then I noticed it was a little boy. I was like what the fuck? I don't have any brothers So I was like what the hell and then I got up and I was like I try to walk away And then he got out of my bed and he started walking towards me. I was like who the fuck is it? I didn't even know like I was like who the fuck Yeah, I wasn't black shadow. No, it was just an actual just little boy and then like he just disappeared

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:56.402 --> 0:20:59.760]: 
  Give Regis for two. Yeah, I wasn't- Was it a black shadow? No, it was just-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:02.325 --> 0:21:09.464]: 
  But it didn't register to the skillet you just registered like oh wait me like my mom has a friend over or something It's exactly what I thought was a cousin asleep brows

 SPEAKER_01 [0:21:06.460 --> 0:22:00.038]: 
  or something, it's exactly what I thought it was. That's not sleep paralysis. No, but that time I wasn't paralyzed, but I... I was on sleep paralysis. Yeah, no, no, that was Jake. I just woke up and I used to get that. And then I ran to my parents' room and I woke up there so I knew it was real. And then I kept getting that same fucking boy for a long time and then it stopped. But then when I turned 19, I started getting sleep paralysis again, but the actual where I was actually paralyzed, I started getting that every single night and I saw, I was seeing figures in my room, hearing tapping on my windows, hearing like... I used to get audio hallucinations, a lot more than visual, but like, the audio ones were kind of creepy. And then I'd get like visual ones every few nights and I'd see just shadows and stuff. It's audio hallucinations. Like it would just... I didn't hear it. No, but it wasn't like, it wasn't even scary. Like I just hear like a football game going on. Or like ambience. Or I used to work in like McDonald's and I just hear McDonald's like exact sounds of like what happened in McDonald's is going on. And then like I'd get...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:12.096 --> 0:21:13.176]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_03 [0:21:15.522 --> 0:21:16.956]: 
  And then I ran to my parents room.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:45.779 --> 0:21:47.618]: 
  Like it would just hear it

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:54.992 --> 0:21:55.043]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:00.038 --> 0:22:08.644]: 
  like a visual one where it would just be a shadow man in a hat. See you and Chris talked about it so casually. If I saw a shadow figure in a room and it was paralyzed, I would think I would have a heart attack. No, no.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:08.374 --> 0:22:13.302]: 
  No, but I think there's something like at the time it is so scary, but then when you wake up you're like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:13.049 --> 0:22:23.325]: 
  I know it's not a real David or something, but it's clearly a sleep paralysis. It's your own brain making it, so it literally fishes from both feet.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:22.161 --> 0:22:27.443]: 
  Yeah, it knows your brain knows exactly what's the most scary thing in your head and it conjures that up like I?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:26.819 --> 0:22:32.877]: 
  I haven't I'm sorry. I haven't gotten it in like four years. So I'm like I look back on it like that was kind of cool I haven't got

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:32.354 --> 0:22:38.108]: 
  I haven't gotten it since I moved to America, but I used to get it every night when I lived in But that would be frugal because he would have hated

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:36.100 --> 0:23:01.446]: 
  What happened to you frugally Chris? You would have hated it. No, no, but the thing is um, so the first time it happened I was lying on my back staring at like into the ceiling or whatever or the wall I was like, you're on your back And then you just feel like I kind of like take hold of you and then you're glued to your bed and you can't move Right, so like the first time it happened. I had no idea what happened. I've never heard of sleep paralysis before I was fucking terrified. You think you were dying or something? I just couldn't believe what happened It was like a ghost was in the room. Yeah, I couldn't believe it. There's no this.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:55.759 --> 0:22:56.755]: 
  You think you were dying?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:59.489 --> 0:23:00.417]: 
  I couldn't believe it

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:01.446 --> 0:23:02.830]: 
  not distinguishable from reality.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:02.172 --> 0:24:14.785]: 
  Then I like I told my mom and my sister and my sister's like that happens to me every single night I was just like oh, that's really to that bed. It happens to her every single night. Oh my god every night, too But the thing is like I was like so what causes it and I looked it up And it's like when you're in bed your brain goes are you sleep yet? And you might feel like a little itch in your face so you go to scratch and your brain goes Oh, you're still awake So if you feel like little like itches on your face at nighttime and you don't scratch it your body will go Okay, you're falling asleep now, so it releases that chemical, but if you're still awake That's you start dreaming while you're awake and you can't move right? You're always gonna dream bad shit cuz the second you realize you can't move you feel claustrophobic Yeah, and your brain goes what I what I what I heard was that yeah the the initial anxiety of realizing Yeah, just just the anxiety of realizing that you're paralyzed. Yeah causes your brain to look for danger because those are anxious Yeah, but the second time it happened to me I told it was like it was an airplane crash stream But then I was in my bed glued and I was looking around my room and I couldn't move right But the second time I was like you're in sleep paralysis You know what's going on do not think of anything bad I was darting my eyes around just trying to like strike myself from thinking of something scary Like I was trying to like call it to my friend, but I couldn't do it's like Yeah, I feel like if I was thinking to that anything better, then we just need to think of something better

 SPEAKER_01 [0:23:07.200 --> 0:23:08.550]: 
  To that degree, to that bed?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:09.647 --> 0:23:10.474]: 
 おまえ!

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:27.417 --> 0:23:27.839]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:22.244 --> 0:24:28.994]: 
  I have a really bad story of a ghost girl. I'm scared of cliches. No, I'm kidding.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:27.374 --> 0:24:33.550]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:31.002 --> 0:24:40.992]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:34.394 --> 0:24:37.397]: 
  So in my head I laughed, I saw Smurf blaring because...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:40.334 --> 0:24:45.784]: 
  Man, I like sometimes I'm not even paralyzed and I have to have these hallucinations when I wake up This is you see these so

 SPEAKER_02 [0:24:44.856 --> 0:25:37.995]: 
  This is your thing they so my only experience with sleep paralysis where you guys have all experienced I love you, my only experiences is not being able to get up and just like feeling the Yeah being like yeah, that's so weird as you close your eyes and visualize your entire body getting up But then when you open them again, you're in the exact you're dreaming dude. It's terrifying I just give one little weird fact about it though that yeah, so The first time I was like I realized you get it cuz you're lying down on your back in bed And you're falling asleep, right when I learned that that happened to me because I was on my back I laid on my front for a few months and it didn't happen to me again And the very same night I laid on my back for the first time in months. It happened to me again So I haven't done it I never sleep in the bag I don't sleep my back for that like I can sleep on my side my front my back But I have not slept in my back sense cuz I'm too afraid I strictly sleep my stomach I sleep on my back Well, I haven't had it's happen, but no what's interesting is you've told me that you like Hallucinate like even after waking up sometimes like you said yeah, I go

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:48.248 --> 0:24:48.619]: 
  We are.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:24:49.750 --> 0:24:50.374]: 
  அழு வீட்டையின்

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:54.053 --> 0:24:55.504]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:24:55.504 --> 0:24:56.719]: 
  That's so weird.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:01.022 --> 0:25:02.963]: 
  You're dreaming dude.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:01.140 --> 0:25:01.326]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25 --> 0:25:06.405]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:23.550 --> 0:25:24.732]: 
  I'd never sleep in the bed.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:29.085 --> 0:25:30.452]: 
  I strictly sleep where I stop.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:30.452 --> 0:25:30.621]: 
  Thank you for watching.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:32.258 --> 0:25:33.085]: 
  But no, it's it's

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:37.439 --> 0:25:41.202]: 
  Yeah, I go to the bathroom or something and I'll see something out the window and like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:40.746 --> 0:25:45.454]: 
  Yeah, you told me you went to the bathroom with a ground floor and like behind a tree sling a long tall

 SPEAKER_01 [0:25:44.914 --> 0:26:14.513]: 
  It was like before slender man was a thing so I'm not like ripping on but I saw a thing It was almost like slender wasn't exactly like it But I saw like a really fucking thing just like literally like right near a tree about like I'd say 20 feet away from the window But I was already getting these things beforehand So I like knew it was fake, but the worst ones I used to get is the like I swear to God It was the most evil I barely even saw her but it was like an evil presence of a girl That's why I'm scared of it because that because this is what triggered it because I got the most evil presence ever

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:57.908 --> 0:25:58.650]: 
  Windows.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:14.412 --> 0:26:16.605]: 
  You said that our flat was haunted by a little different.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:15.981 --> 0:26:18.833]: 
  Yeah, because I thought it was the same one that I can't see in. It's just stress, like...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:17.483 --> 0:26:37.952]: 
  I can't see him Isn't stress like the cause of like Yeah, it's a huge, it's a huge It's a huge factor, yeah Stressing yourself out, it causes air loss, it causes you to sleepwalk Yeah, what it does is it fucks with you The more stressed you are, the more you're playing And the more the more it fucks you, the more stressed you get Yeah, so it's like it's exactly like just rolling down a hill Can I elaborate on that?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:20.993 --> 0:26:21.803]: 
  Yeah, it's a huge

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:21.449 --> 0:26:23.946]: 
  That's a huge, it's a huge, it's a huge factor.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:23.946 --> 0:26:24.419]: 
  Stretching your

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:27.591 --> 0:26:28.452]: 
  What it does is it

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:30.392 --> 0:26:32.333]: 
  Yeah, and the more folks you the more

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:33.075 --> 0:26:34.122]: 
  Yeah, so it's like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:37.041 --> 0:26:43.859]: 
  Can I elaborate on that little girl though? Like now I know it's like not real but while it's happening I still like it's as real as it gets

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:43.150 --> 0:28:02.378]: 
  I don't see her, I don't see her, but I just know she's there. But the second time I got sleep paralysis I was like, I know exactly what's happening. Does that not happen to you? I think what he's saying is like even though it's even though he knows what it is, it's still scary because you're saying a little. But to elaborate just a tiny bit, to elaborate what we were talking about, I only ever had sleep paralysis once in my life ever and I didn't see anything. I was laying on my side and I felt like a, that's not what I described as an evil presence. And it felt like I felt like looking at me over me, like hunching over me and then I felt my body being pulled out of my window which is next to my bed, my old house. And I was like, this is fucking scary dude. I swear dude. Yeah, this is not cool. And then somebody woke me up and I was like, hopefully, fun. You guys have all these experiences, like one really weird experience I had that I recall after a while, we guys talked in your stuff, is I remember sitting in my room when I was really little, it was at one of my dad's places. I think he was, it was like kind of like a makeshift room because he was turning it into an office and it was also a room so I was kind of like sleeping with all these. So it was a room that was full of a bunch of fucking like doctoring equipment and shit. And this guy with a cowboy hat comes into the room and fucking tips it at me. Did, did, did not tell you? No, he was just, he just walks in. Did you have the hat guy? He said, don't tell me you had the fucking hat guy. Listen, he comes in, he tipped his hat at me and then he left and I was sitting there and looking at it and I was just like, man that hat guy, that's a cop. I was telling this about the hat guy. That's a cop of God. That's a cop of God.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:44.939 --> 0:26:46.440]: 
  No, I don't see her. I don't see her.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:46.440 --> 0:26:48.415]: 
  I just know she's there the second time I

 SPEAKER_01 [0:26:51.486 --> 0:26:52.448]: 
  No, no, no, don't.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:52.448 --> 0:26:52.752]: 
  easily.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:55.232 --> 0:26:56.751]: 
  You see a little- At the time.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:57.494 --> 0:26:59.063]: 
  I only saw her once.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:00.042 --> 0:27:00.700]: 
  that these facts

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:16.191 --> 0:27:18.452]: 
  I swear, dude. That's a good one.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:18.452 --> 0:27:21.372]: 
  That's not cool. And then somebody woke me up and I was like, holy fuck.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:36.458 --> 0:27:36.863]: 
  That's kind of like.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:47.005 --> 0:27:47.950]: 
  Didn't I tell you?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:49.148 --> 0:27:52.202]: 
  Did you have the hack?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:55.965 --> 0:27:55.982]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:55.982 --> 0:28:06.293]: 
  That's the process. That's the hack guy calling me. That's the hack guy calling me. I was telling us about the hack guy. That's the call of God. That's the call of God. That's the call of God. That's the hack guy's in everyone's fucking... That's the sleep paralysis. Everyone gets the hack guy. That's why it's scary.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:56.944 --> 0:27:57.501]: 
  I was just like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:04.116 --> 0:28:53.931]: 
  That's why it's scary. Do you want to know fucking true terror? This is real right my sister is a sleepwalker and a sleep talker She she used to walk through the house in her sleep, and we just got used to it We'd be like okay student again, but nothing is fucking scarier than hearing footsteps going down the hall at the fucking dead of night Right you hear Fucking exorcist talk. Oh, yeah. No, that's like fucking chicken and dog. That's what she does. It's fucking scary It's weird too because you know when you stay over at your friend's house I'm gonna stay the night at his house, and like you don't realize that your friend sometimes sleep sleep talks That is terrifying. He has such a normal apparently I do it too, but I like sometimes I'll be I'll be like laying next door and she'd be like haha. It's funny. That's English you fucking cares She's sitting there.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:54.758 --> 0:29:52.504]: 
  Talking about what's up on the TV? My friend too he'd be like put over there, and I would just be like I'm sure I'm sure I'll crystal this but I I've heard you sleep Yeah Zack does sleep a screen I So the difference between sleep paralysis is like you wake up and you see something that tears are literally the exact No, no, no, it is it's that bad you've never done it that bad, but you've got you've woken up and got like Oh, it is the most horrifying Seriously like like fight or flight they ever but you know why you just wake up terrified But sometimes I'll do this the I might have talked about before but a few times It's not sleep paralysis, but a hallucination for like maybe five to ten seconds tops Yeah after wake up if I have that like one time I woke up when I was really terrified and I saw ants all over I thought it was like oh like what a Alan what he Allen was on your head fuck you Chris

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:57.087 --> 0:28:58.167]: 
  What's-

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:00.563 --> 0:29:01.508]: 
  And I would just be like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:29:01.508 --> 0:29:03.094]: 
  Yeah, I used to just say like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:03.094 --> 0:29:03.735]: 
  nonsense

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:06.503 --> 0:29:09.912]: 
  sleep talk? Yeah, I've heard you sleep talk. I've heard you sleep scream.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:13.439 --> 0:29:13.540]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:14.367 --> 0:29:15.885]: 
  I have like, that's like tears.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:21.539 --> 0:29:25.099]: 
  You wake up going... AHHHHHH! No, no, no, no, no. No, it is, it's that bad.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:54.462 --> 0:31:15.462]: 
  I could be in your hand for a little bit here. I took my lamp on it and disappeared. But a few nights ago, I was really, really tired. I was on a Skype call with somebody. And I fell asleep on the Skype call. They sent something. For some reason, it terrified me. And I screamed. I screamed when I woke up. I saw three figures in my room standing, staring at me. And that terrified me more. So I was like, ahhh! And then they fucking went away. And I couldn't go back to bed. Oh, you're talking about that kind of stuff. That's happened to me before. But I never really thought of it. Because it's not like in the same vein of sleep paralysis. It's a little bit different, but it still feels fine. I was sleeping on my side against the wall. It was completely dark, but it was like this weird thing where I'm pretty sure the shadows were just playing tricks on me. Because it was at night and there was like a lot of lights on outside. So all these like different shadows on my room were there. And when I woke up, I turned around because I was like facing the wall. And you know when you face a wall and your fucking vision has been completely blocked out for the last 12 hours? You turn and immediately see all these different fucking shadows moving and wiggling. You just like, yeah! Cause I was just like, oh, and I'm like, and it's just like things are like fucking scurrying under your bed and like it's some shit and you're just like, what is going on? I used to get really bad hallucinations at my grandmother's house where she had this big huge painting on her wall. And it was like an old Irish lane and the, you know, the road wraps all the way down this lane. I used to always just look at it when I was trying to go to sleep and I'd see like little like shadows walking up and down it. Oh my god, that happened to me as well.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:56.385 --> 0:29:58.562]: 
  I chewed my lip on it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:17.699 --> 0:30:18.998]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:06.930 --> 0:32:09.546]: 
  You get off the boat, you fucking walkie-talkie up some kind of...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:14.322 --> 0:32:14.727]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:17.562 --> 0:32]: 
  Yeah, come here.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32 --> 0:32:19.452]: 
  Is that sports of your year?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:31.197 --> 0:32:31.635]: 
  I was like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:35.702 --> 0:32:35.736]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:53.219 --> 0:32:53.438]: 
  I'm

 SPEAKER_01 [0:32:53.438 --> 0:32:53.826]: 
  I'm just like...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:32:58.500 --> 0:32:58.956]: 
  Thanks.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:05.790 --> 0:33:07.343]: 
  So I was like, what do I do?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:20.995 --> 0:33:25.180]: 
  That's like Roodscape. That was like Street's Roodscape. That's the whole thing!

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:29.871 --> 0:33:33.921]: 
  You're trying to sneer ROOTSCAPE for everybody, you're trying to start a campaign.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:33:40.367 --> 0:33:43.860]: 
  Yeah, you're preaching to the choir there though, like... Don't we tell you about the guy? Don't we tell you about the guy?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:42.122 --> 0:35:07.240]: 
  Did I ever tell you about the guy fucked on Fricadia? Yeah, you did. You talked about the pedophile, baby. No, you talked about how he violently forced his yif ways on you. You didn't even want to be a part of it. This was a different guy. He was, um... I was 14 and I met a guy in Fricadia and he was like, Hey, baby, you know, I was pretending to be a girl and I was trying to find guys to fuck with. So I was like, Hey, what's up? You want a yif? He's like, Yeah, whatever. I used to do that in Naya. I saw it. I pretty much fucked the guy in Fricadia. I was like, Yeah, I was like, you like fucking me? And he's like, Yeah. And I was like, Well, I'm a 14 year old boy. And he was like, I don't care. And he just kept fucking me. And I was like, Okay, that's weird. And then you keep going. No, no, no. I stopped. You tried to set it up, but he like, No, yeah, it was just, he just did not care. Why do 14 year old boys have a draw to pretending to be 13 year old girls? To old men, I don't get it because everyone does it. It's the only way you can fucking troll people at that age. Yeah. Is that really trolling? You're just making something like jerk off. To you, you're like, I'm going to surprise him. It's that's the equivalent of like dressing with a girl making your friend fucking you and be like, Gotcha, you're gay now. You're fucking me. I literally that kind of stuff. Because you're making a guy masturbate to you. Yeah. That kind of stuff is such like a waste of time. I would never even think about wasting my time doing it. It's like opening up an IMVU account and fucking conning somebody. It's like, what do you get out of it? Wasting your time? Ultimately. Like getting a fucking malware on your computer for downloading fucking IMVU first. Look, I was a vigilante. Okay. I only did it the people who deserve this. Yeah, me too. I downloaded it. She downloaded every IMVU app. Her fucking computer was running at one point. Oh my God.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:45.430 --> 0:33:48.062]: 
  You fucked up, you talked with the pedophile man.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:50.830 --> 0:33:52.467]: 
  You don't even want to be a part of it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:02.187 --> 0:34:02.474]: 
  So

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:14.572 --> 0:34:14.909]: 
  And

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:15.974 --> 0:34:16.496]: 
  You can go.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:16.496 --> 0:34:18.960]: 
  No, no, no, I stop.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:20.445 --> 0:34:20.952]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:27.228 --> 0:34:29.052]: 
  Every word does it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:30.655 --> 0:34:31.279]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:35.380 --> 0:34:36.172]: 
  That's the good one.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:41.420 --> 0:34:43.344]: 
  Cause you making a guy dance to big jeans.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:46.922 --> 0:34:47.580]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:53.588 --> 0:34:54.110]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:56.828 --> 0:34:59.444]: 
  Look, I was a vigilante, okay?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:59.444 --> 0:34:59.697]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:01.502 --> 0:35:02.498]: 
  3, 2, 1.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:05.805 --> 0:35:06.953]: 
  Oh my god.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:07.932 --> 0:35:31.962]: 
  Just like gotta open up IMVU or a fucking screen, just flashing red, it's like warning your computer as a virus. She's like, move, we gotta play. Like IMVU appears on like porn websites on the corner. Who downloaded that? I downloaded IMVU because I was curious. I was like, what is this gay shit? It's like Second Life, except worse. It's malware, you install it and it's like, it's like would you like IMVU keycard? I'm like, no, I don't want this. And it automatically installs all your stuff.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:09.147 --> 0:35:09.889]: 
  That is the biggest thing.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:10.075 --> 0:35:12.117]: 
  We're splashing red at you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:15.509 --> 0:35:19.457]: 
  IMVU appears on like porn websites on the corn who download that?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:22.495 --> 0:35:22.950]: 
  this is geisha

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:22.950 --> 0:35:23.389]: 
  It's like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:24.486 --> 0:35:27.237]: 
  It's malware. You install it and it's like

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:30.055 --> 0:35:36.636]: 
  You install it like any website you go on it's like would you like to buy some fucking imv u haircuts?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:35.961 --> 0:39:38.809]: 
  What is this game? I've never heard this before. It's just like second life. It was like ten years ago. It's like if you take second life and cut out everything and you put it in one house and you can decorate it and you can have your lame hipster clothes and you can go in there and be like talk to each other and wave. Second life is fucking weird on its own. The last time I played with Chris we went to some strip club and there was some four-year-old woman and Chris was harassing her. Fuck you! You were harassing her! I was being polite! He's fucking lying! I said I had an eight-inch dick and I heard some four-year-old smoker go who has an eight-inch dick, call up a hair big boy and I was like I got an eight-inch dick. It's a real fucking big baby. And you harassed her because you're no damn good dirty fool. You're a fucking liar! I do not harass people in second life. I fish for it. I fucking, I act like the people. I'm polite to them and I see what funny shit they'll say. That's the worst they'll do. Hey Chris, you like bait them kinda. Chris, you walk through there and you're like guys, who is a backslash B, backslash bro here. You did what I did. You come in and you be like I'm innocent. Hey, who wants to be my friend? I'm new to the game. I'm a woman. The worst, the actual worst thing I did in second life was the, I went to Sonic Town and it was really bad because there was a girl who looked like shadow. She was female shadow and she was just dancing with some guy and I walked over and I was dressed as Tails. Tails was a girl. And I was like, excuse me, could you turn this fucking music down? And they were like, whoa! Did she trigger you? I was like, you turn this fucking music down and you're like whoa, what's your problem? I was like, you are like, yeah, you're triggering me and then everyone was like whoa, you better turn it down or whatever. The girl was like, well I shouldn't have to turn it down. I was like, you call me a faggonegler and then this huge fucking epidemic of people screaming over each other started happening where people were, people thought I was a girl. They were defending me for bursting in and telling this poor girl to turn off her music. People were defending my fucking ass because they're fucking worthless. Because you said they were a trigger. You like, ruined a friendship of like five years. There was, no that was a separate incident. You've ruined several friendships. Yeah, well I walked into a guy, pretty much just called him names for like a minute. I was being an asshole but I just wanted to see what had happened because I was dressed as Tails and I just wanted to see what they would do. That's what Eric had been like. My predictions came true. They were treating me good because I was a girl and they didn't believe their friend, who they had been friends with for months and months and they just believed my word because I waltzed in and said that I triggered them. That's how much power the word trigger has. Dude, it's power. It does. You pull out the, you pull out the tasty words that people use. So, I was, look, okay, I was being a huge con but I just wanted to see what would happen. I think the fact that was the outcome, kind of the gates of the fact that you would be a dick. Yeah, like, if they were like fuck off asshole, be like okay, that's not very interesting for the fact. If they had like kicked me out instantly I would have been like yep deserved it but no they didn't. They kept me there. They treated me like royalty because I said I was triggered because I was a girl. They told the actual victim and fucking blamed her, they victim blamed her if you will. And at the end of it, the fucking, the poor girl, everyone made her apologize to me because I said that she triggered me and I called her a faggone. Are you serious? Yes. It was fucking bullshit. It's funny. This is like a presidential candidate in like 2004 fucking going second like the whole weekend or like 2008 I think. Yeah. Barack Obama opened up his second life. Well, he's like hey y'all please vote for me. They're like get out of this sort of dancing party. No, but no, I think like I want to see what's going on. He did like. There is weird remnants on second life where like big companies have purchased land for a few years and they've just completely forgotten about it so you can go and visit shit that's just like ghost towns. Oh yeah, Mountain Dew has like a fucking like they have this like factory that you go into and there's nothing there. It's completely barren with like a chair in the center of it. There's a chair in the center of it. Yo wait shout out to the best gamers for showing me how to do stuff in second life. Have you guys ever played Club Penguin before? Yes. Just about to bring up Club Penguin. Yes. Club Penguin for me was coming in and being like fuck this game. Cory banned immediately. Cory, can I ask? Cory. It was bullshit. It's rigged. It's fucking bullshit. So they did. I went up to this guy and it's just like I don't like this game. Can someone tell me how to leave this hub and I'm like fuck you. Fuck this game. Cory what do you think? Cory what do you think the reason?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:35:37.564 --> 0:35:38.813]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:41.209 --> 0:35:42.525]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:44.584 --> 0:35:46.677]: 
  Yeah, you can like decorate it and you can have this

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:01.442 --> 0:36:02.252]:

  Everybody down!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:36.994 --> 0:49:59.100]: 
  That's now! Bray out the dancing lobsters! Have you ever escalated a situation to avoid a different situation? Like, if you ever seen somebody be a weirdo, so you just tried to out-crazy them so they leave you alone? I did that recently. I was with Chris and I went to Wawa, we saw this guy by a Papa John's in a pizza outfit.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:59.100 --> 0:50:12.432]: 
  We were walking to uh, Wawa one day and like there's a Papa John's between our house and Wawa And when we were walking towards the Papa John's we noticed there was a guy in a pizza outfit doing a dance He was kinda going, hey guys! And he was giving it his all, he was dancing

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:08.517 --> 0:50:11.504]: 
  He's gonna go, hey guys, he was giving it all.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:12.330 --> 0:50:15.149]: 
  I got the feeling we were like oh he's totally the poser

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:13.799 --> 0:50:25.442]: 
  And as we got closer, as we got closer, there was no avoiding him. So we were like, oh god, he's gonna do something And he saw he even saw us going like oh for fuck's sake and then he's still kind of like sadly, but like hopped over to it

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:25.442 --> 0:50:37.289]: 
  He was like so I saw this guy's like this guy's talking about me. He went hey, what's a pizza?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:34.420 --> 0:50:35.044]: 
  Yeah, the beat.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:36.495 --> 0:50:45.675]: 
  The video is just dancing like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, so this guy just skipped on over to us did a dancing goes you and pizza It's actually because I love it a pizza

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:44.275 --> 0:50:47.987]: 
  The guy, the guy, I mean you fucking bitch. She actually panicked.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:46.350 --> 0:50:56.492]: 
  She actually panicked. You could see he was visibly frightened even though he's wearing a piece outfit and he like backed off and just didn't And then like when we were walking back he was still there and there was

 SPEAKER_02 [0:50:56.087 --> 0:51:25.602]: 
  He avoided us that time. He avoided us. He just did not. He just didn't. So that's my solution. If everyone's like being crazy, but he's out-crazy, they think of a psycho. So you do that anyways, cause we went to Giant Theater the other day, we were walking in, we were walking into the door. Zach, like, he got this weird burp and he just went, UGH! And then a fucking girl walking by just looked at him and discussed and kept walking. This girl, like a ponytail idiot, was like, She looked at us like, but I was like, I was far away from her too. It was like in her fucking ear. You screamed it, you went, UGH! No, it looked like an idiot. I really would.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:50:57.859 --> 0:50:58.433]: 
  It's not.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:50:57.944 --> 0:50:58.399]: 
  No, I'm...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:03.360 --> 0:51:04.170]: 
  I don't know if you do that.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:11.309 --> 0:51:12.456]: 
  ugh

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:23.307 --> 0:51:24.589]: 
  No, I'm with- I'm with-

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:26.260 --> 0:51:54.188]: 
  Okay, I'm gonna tell the most embarrassing exact story ever. What? What? Well, but don't see it for who me. You ever. What? You're gonna cover your face with shame. We were crossing the road the other day, and there was a car coming. And Zach ran in front of the car, and we stayed behind. It's not true. He looked like an idiot. That's today. He looked like a fucking idiot. He crossed the road, and we didn't see anything. And then someone was like, Don't do this. You fucking dope. Not here. What did you do? He was like, Look at the beat. He was like, I'm gonna control the way.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:51:29.483 --> 0:51:30.276]: 
  What?

  That's it, eh?

 SPEAKER_01 [0:51:44.502 --> 0:51:47.556]: 
  He crossed the road and he was just there and he was like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:51:51.842 --> 0:51:56.618]: 
  He was like I'm gonna cross the road

 SPEAKER_02 [0:51:55.352 --> 0:52:50.112]: 
  I'm gonna cross the road. I'm gonna be the first over but he had to wait first anyway We tell the story of the of the mall candy girl. Okay.

I said what did you say you look like my friend Dan? And I said no and she said okay, and she went but I don't think it was like that makes that situation makes no sense First of all, she's on duty. So if I thought I saw you cori in a place. I would say are you cori? I'll say hey cori. Yeah, it's really fucking bizarre. Are you my friend? I said what I said, okay Well, then maybe she was meeting something she's a rep before I like from online or something was like no That's making sense either cuz she would know what they look like and why would she meet them on the job? And I was like maybe she was hitting me It's like no cuz nobody's gonna fucking hit me like that because I avoid her that every time I walk around

  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:30.415 --> 0:56:31.444]: 
  Oh no it's not.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:32.507 --> 0:56:35.545]: 
  Ireland's like Romaine's. They're just like gypsies.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:37.215 --> 0:56:37.452]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:56:39.949 --> 0:56]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56 --> 0:56:41.704]: 
  That seems like a strictly wrong game.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:43.341 --> 0:56:50.715]: 
  Yeah, but like look they're not all of them not already but they're just a specific color meaning just see they usually like sit on the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:56:50.108 --> 0:56:53.297]: 
  Okay, so you just say put it like a camper or something

 SPEAKER_01 [0:56:53.297 --> 0:57:22.525]: 
  They usually sit on a road, the side of the road with their heads down and they have a cup out and you just throw change in there or something But there's this whole like group of them that go around with dead babies Like they're little kids and they go around with dead babies in their hands and they're like I don't recall Hold on, hold on, hold on There's not this, there's just not the epidemic of people with dead babies No, swear to God it's real. I haven't seen it, but I've read about this, this is real I've never seen it, it's not real, but it's real Look it up, they rock around with dead babies and they're like, my baby's really sick and I'm only like 12 There's another

 SPEAKER_03 [0:56:59.592 --> 0:57:00.081]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:07.337 --> 0:57:12.619]: 
  Hold on hold on. There's not this this is not the epidemic of people with babies

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:15.859 --> 0:57:17.834]: 
  I didn't see it, it's not real but it's real

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:21.884 --> 0:57:45.947]: 
  There's an objective proof that there's gypsies who sit on the side of the streets and steal shit. Yeah, but this is real too. But I've never seen a fucking dead baby gypsy come up. If it happened once, it doesn't mean it happened to fucking waves. Look, if you go to Rome, you'll see your family. Let's really figure this out, Nile. Let's really figure this out. The amount of time it takes to make that happen is nine months. The baby rots after a night.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:26.052 --> 0:57:26.946]: 
  Yeah, but this is really

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:29.612 --> 0:57:36.295]: 
  If it happened once, it doesn't mean it happens in fucking waves. Look, if you go to home, you'll see me in the living room.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:57:33.578 --> 0:57:33.730]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:57:45.947 --> 0:57:49.829]: 
  day no but like the baby's like a new new dead baby

 SPEAKER_02 [0:57:49.407 --> 0:58:13.200]: 
  If you were touring Europe and you're just like, oh, it's nice. But what I'm saying is that to do that often is hard to do because it takes nine months to make a baby. And then to kill it. Do you see what I'm saying? Why don't you just get like a real doll looking thing? Yeah, get a real doll and fucking pull the realms. Look him up to half an hour. Man, I'm just saying, right, if anyone wants to donate a real doll, like, I will take it. Corey, what did the ass say to the butthole? You know what I'm talking about dude? And Corey, what did the fuck say to the shit?
