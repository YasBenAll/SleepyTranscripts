I saw your intro, you say I do art and a little bit of a little different thing. You say art and you work in apron and you're cooking. Yeah, you're right. That was a beautiful intro.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:03:39.822 --> 0:03:40.176]:

 SPEAKER_03 [0:03:57.996 --> 0:05:18.777]: 
  Yeah, you really fucked with a lot of people. That was actually his old video. That was the first video I saw. That was the first thing you saw. The first video I saw was a hair dryer. Oh, cool. I'm not gonna do that. Did you see his red to white chalkboard should be legal? That was a really good video. It went down immediately. He's sweating. He's like 2pm. He's pacing back and forth. He's like punching the wall. He's like, what are those YouTube videos you regret a minute later? Look at chalkboard be legal. It went down. I don't know what the fuck happened to it dude. It's a weird tutorial. You just don't see it. You wouldn't take it down. It's not like that. So, how long have you been doing stuff for? Stuff. What? Cause you're one of us Newgrounds folks. I knew you said this. One of us Newgrounds bozos. You're actually one of the kind of the first guys. I'm gonna watch you use stuff back when that first wave of guys who were... You were good and... I think there was a couple of waves of Newgrounds stuff. The first wave was like 1999, early 2000. Where it was like stick figures, shitty guard... Shaped cartoons. And then there was like the... shitty garble. Adam Phillips, you, Harry, you guys started all coming. I wouldn't... I wouldn't... No, seriously. The guys making stuff that looked like... It was like, no. This is a fitness, historian structure. It's the production quality. My sister. You are the one who let me hear that. You're not putting it there.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:03:59.751 --> 0:04:01.945]:

  that dude's got a few sticky soaps

 SPEAKER_04 [0:04:12.964 --> 0:04:16.677]: 
  It was a video. It was a video. That was really popular.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:04:29.046 --> 0:04:30.312]: 
  Kia bears

 SPEAKER_04 [0:04:32.539 --> 0:04:33.012]: 
  So

 SPEAKER_04 [0:05:05.952 --> 0:05:07.049]: 
  No, seriously, no, no.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:10.947 --> 0:05:11.183]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:12.634 --> 0:05:14.001]: 
  People have like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:16.532 --> 0:05:30.437]: 
  You are the one who let me hear that, you're a putty either. Do you guys remember the sticks to the side, the website? Yes. Yeah. So that's where I started playing around. So I started with stick figures. It's weird. Yeah, it's like a really good intro. I know. I was interested in the like, the martial arts.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:20.920 --> 0:05:22.709]: 
  Yes, of course, that's why I said that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:23.789 --> 0:05:24.835]: 
  Sorry.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:26.050 --> 0:05:35.770]: 
  Yeah, it's like a really good intro. I used to get the feelig, like, in return to Greenville or whatever. I feel like I learned about the principles of anime.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:05:30.437 --> 0:05:30.454]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:32.783 --> 0:05:32.952]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:32.867 --> 0:05:38.942]: 
  I feel like the bees are learned about the principles of animation without knowing their names through doing stick figure.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:38.301 --> 0:05:41.693]: 
  You know, like you see like this to me, isn't he? Right. You know, we are...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:38.942 --> 0:05:39.415]: 
  like you see.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:40.664 --> 0:05:52.139]: 
  You know if the arm is close to the draw today, the other arm looks like it smooths down and slows down so you know that looks good. I still use like six fingers a lot to help me play that action when it's draw time. Like you mean the skeleton for a minute? Yeah, I do that too.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:05:44.393 --> 0:05:45.287]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:05:46.317 --> 0:05:46.840]: 
  That's what we used to do.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:05:49.742 --> 0:05:58.382]: 
  Like you mean the skills and for yeah, yeah, I do that too. I feel like Steve Fierce helped you learn like to do good poses because like they're essentially silhouettes of like a fix-how

 SPEAKER_03 [0:05:55.294 --> 0:06:06.719]: 
  Cause they're essentially similar. So like a figure. So how I started drawing like Mario and Sonic, I do like stickman with like you know that line above the head for a hat and then a squiggly line underneath the stick.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:05:56.492 --> 0:05:57.437]: 
  Silhouettes and like it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:06:07.512 --> 0:08:25.094]: 
  circle head? or you should be on it it's Sonic 3 spike but I think it is a good topic because I think we also do it to some degree I started, I hit to a mid but I did shape cartoons at some point to experiment around and even that helped me if you do the ball trick, that old classic picture of the ball with the different frames stretching you right I tell people who are just starting out because they ask me what do I do, a lot of people will try to draw like a full, don't do that and I just get confused if you figure out the principles, it makes it a lot easier just with basic stick figures or balls or squares, it makes it a lot easier because they apply to everything I also like to break it down with certain points where you put a body together like how you do a doll so you make the head go with the body and then you slowly start to put the arms on, the legs on, that's pretty much how if I'm animating a really complicated thing with lots of frames in front of it and I think people don't, I don't think people realize that it's actually something I had to learn and what people do when they first start out is if they have somebody's whole body moving the whole body starts and stops moving at the exact same time in other words the hands, the hair, the eyes everything moves, starts and stops that really is what gives animation life is when the arm moves at a different rate than the legs moves, than the hands and the hair another thing that's really weird, I don't know if this is just me but I find that drawing with black doesn't I don't get as much satisfying lines as drawing with something like a gray or like a color that's... for a soyboard you mean? or yeah, for like soyboard whatever you store is for what I always do, light colors so I'll do like a really light yellow or like green, so that way if I in between I can see those two colors and make the in between picture I'll make that black and then go between those two I always feel like black green is the next front yellow is the earlier frame black always gets too messy for me correct to say, as far as animation goes you do like a savant, you do things that I do it doesn't make sense, it's like a math problem it's like watching the fucking, a beautiful mind guy drawing the fucking on the window probably your own techniques and shit jazzy, you got any super special techniques for secrets any patented jazzy techniques that you... when you start off with your kid, no one tells you no one gives you a manual, so you're like, oh I guess I'll just do this and people are like, that's how you fucking do it? never heard of the animators survival kid, you dumb idiot you and Riven Williams put your Williams, nice brain tube right there does he have one of those? now you guys, open a hex on just now

 SPEAKER_04 [0:06:12.389 --> 0:06:13.232]: 
  Abonne-toi!

 SPEAKER_04 [0:06:27.509 --> 0:06:27.812]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:06:55.234 --> 0:06:56.230]: 
  pretty much how you find it.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:06:58.677 --> 0:06:59.723]: 
  a lot of frames in front of the camera.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:06:59.723 --> 0:07:00.010]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:07:18.032 --> 0:07:18.437]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:47.344 --> 0:07:49.386]: 
  Black always gets too messy for me.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:07:51.933 --> 0:07:52.829]: 
  You do things that I don't do.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:07:59.477 --> 0:08:01.587]: 
  Probably your own techniques and shit.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:08:13.922 --> 0:08:16.403]: 
  Dominion and the Williams

 SPEAKER_04 [0:08:21.668 --> 0:08:22.799]: 
  Is he having one of those?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:25.094 --> 0:08:27.996]: 
  Oh, sorry, we were asking jazz.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:26.444 --> 0:08:28.941]: 
  I don't have any special techniques

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:28.941 --> 0:08:30.443]: 
  I sort of have a little chase.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:30.443 --> 0:08:47.622]: 
  Which is good because in a sense that like because I do tutorials I can essentially teach people how to do it easy Which is what's more popular to learn. Yeah, but um like I really feel like looking up to people like Harry Potter He's not in films. Yeah, it's like it's another level and I'm definitely trying to do that stuff, but in general like

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:37.260 --> 0:08:38.256]: 
 主持人言呢

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:42.154 --> 0:08:43.335]: 
  Yeah. It's white.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:08:47.504 --> 0:08:52.499]: 
  I use like this thing called keyframe caddy, which is like this similar. Yeah, like you have all these thumb

 SPEAKER_02 [0:08:52.499 --> 0:09:01.004]: 
  for the clip they have all the frames in that clip and so especially if like games when you do like sprites and stuff having different like arms and legs and stuff then you can really animate

 SPEAKER_00 [0:08:55.232 --> 0:08:56.076]: 
  especially if like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:09:01.004 --> 0:09:26.772]: 
  different animations. Yeah. I used that for lip sync for a while and then I just gave up and started doing the old fashion one. It's simply interesting. You know Chris and I for example, Chris you specialized in like straight ahead and secondary animation. I just trace like Pokemon. Tracefailerguy. Trace Dilbert. Guys by the way, Helmhangers is a fucking Dilbert Recolor. Yeah. I'm so in one where he's in the shower and he's like, oh, you show her your old filth

 SPEAKER_02 [0:09:36.509 --> 0:09:42.314]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:09:40.356 --> 0:09:43.377]:

Yeah, no, actually it's true. They let you up and cut your tits off. Yeah, I heard about that too. So I got a boy, what do you call it, a thing where you cut off the dick when they're kids? Oh, a frustration. Certificans? Cerstration. That's balls. Is it? Yeah. In Australia, if you have tits bigger than B cups, they let you up and cut the tits off and sit in the toilet and have it. No, balls bigger. No, it's frustration. Tony, I was not around him when they kicked him out. Yeah, he was a nut back. The new guy's the same thing. They're the same guy though, right? The new guy? I didn't know. My point is, I keep hearing that he's like the same thing, so he happens pretty much. No, he's more likeable, which is annoying. Well, that's not hard to... Yeah, that's true. Tony, I would do Pokemon. He's the worst Pokemon, whatever. Yeah, everyone hates him too. The one I always heard was that he was the George Bush one.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:09:46.245 --> 0:09:50.177]:

I heard a story about a weird parasite that swam into somebody's pee bowl. That scared me. Are you the guy that cut it out? No, there's, fuck the water dude. I'm not even afraid of the water. Have you ever had leeches? No, but I would fucking scream if I did. Have you ever had leeches?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:13.110 --> 0:19:17.447]: 
  I cut it out and then I like, like, he pissed on me, I think.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:20.805 --> 0:19:20.957]: 
  I love you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:26.307 --> 0:19:26.999]: 
  Yandı, andı.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:26.999 --> 0:19:30.002]: 
  I heard a story about

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:32.871 --> 0:19:34.238]: 
  I think I'll cut it out, Ken.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:19:37.157 --> 0:19:38.153]: 
  gonna be like one, right?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:19:40.718 --> 0:19:48.025]: 
  I've never been bitten by a leash, but I've been so... Like, it's probably the thing I freaked out about most. Because when you go camping, you're like, rivers and all this stuff, so...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:49.459 --> 0:19:51.957]: 
  I don't even know how I haven't been bitten one, I probably have.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:19:51.569 --> 0:20:27.951]: 
  I would try to have a heart attack. Yeah, I was feeling that. One time I was at my uncle's like he has a bunch of land and he had a bunch of hay bales stacked up for like a year and my dad was like he went for those up and I was like yeah sure I lift one up and I lift the second bail below the top of those lifting up had maggots the size of like my fucking thumb they were huge. Oh that would make me so sick. Alright and then I realized how close my fingers were to touching them and I let out like it was like a demonic shrink I just sort of screamed like it was like a heads up. They were fucking fat and gross maggots and there was a whole pile of it. They were like eating the hay was all like brown gross it was fucking terrifying. I almost had a heart attack it was awful.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:19:53.222 --> 0:19:53.408]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:26.162 --> 0:20:40.371]: 
  I will set the go honey take it was all man. Yeah, I was going for a walk with my ex-girlfriend And I was pretending to be I didn't want it I didn't want to walk any further so I lay down on the road and she was like come on I was like I'm not moving and then she walked for like 20 minutes when I got up. I was covered in ticks

 SPEAKER_04 [0:20:31.495 --> 0:20:32.271]: 
  I didn't want to watch it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:39.089 --> 0:20:44.438]: 
  I hate it. I'm waiting for you laid out on the ground for 20 minutes to eat the sky for a joke. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:20:44.050 --> 0:20:55.947]: 
  Yeah, well like, no one goes on that road. You got like ticked off tonight. You got a road ball. I used to pull their heads up. Their heads got stuck. You have to use the video. I fucking put...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:47.729 --> 0:20:56.790]: 
  You got like ticked off You got a word about it I used to pull their heads up They got stuck I fucking put

 SPEAKER_01 [0:20:53.517 --> 0:20:54.006]: 
  our heads cut.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:20:58.444 --> 0:22:07.885]: 
  Oh, the peroxide? You're supposed to take like the paperclip and put it with the lighter and then poke the ticket and get a ball. Yeah, if we were talking about leeches, because you guys were talking about ticks and stuff, I actually did have leeches on me before. And I was little. And I remember my dad picking me up and throwing me into a river. The context sounds crazy, but he was like, I was a little kid. I was like, I don't want to go, I don't want to swim. I'm scared. And he's like, don't be scared. And he picked me up and threw me into the river. You were cardin' leeches when he came out. Yeah. That's terrifying. Yeah, because I was like, walla fucking walla. I'm sure all the perozites were swimming on me because I was making it to motion. They saw a juicy coys in there. They were like, life on the river. Yeah, but then it came out and I had one on my leg and I was screaming and then he took it off. And then he turned me around and he's like, don't move. And apparently I had like nine leeches on my back. Oh my God. Because it fell on the ground and then they like, you know, it was just like, I was sitting there and you, it's weird because like it doesn't hurt because it like, numbs it. You know, because they like used leeches. Like, it wasn't that like an old practice that you used. Yeah, they still do that. Yeah, because it doesn't hurt. They eat that skin. They eat that skin. They still do that. They do do that. I don't know where. Oh, like places that aren't probably that authentic. No, no, they do. They use maggots through their thing. They put them on your eyeball, right?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:03.102 --> 0:21:03.692]: 
  yap

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:32.498 --> 0:21:33.966]: 
  but like brother

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:43.838 --> 0:21:46.184]: 
  Oh my god, that makes me fucking...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:21:47.449 --> 0:21:48.462]: 
  It was...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:21:56.697 --> 0:21:58.097]: 
  Yeah, they still do that. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:00.443 --> 0:22:01.995]: 
  They do do things they don't wear.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:04.274 --> 0:22:12.441]: 
  authentic On your eyeball right you have gangrene that means like some of your body tissue is dying they put like maggots or leeches on

 SPEAKER_04 [0:22:11.884 --> 0:22:14.230]: 
  He would put a leech on his eyeball.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:13.352 --> 0:22:37.889]: 
  You're saying like medical practice. Yeah, and I'm wondering where they still do that. No, they still do that. Yeah, they still do that. You're saying if I go to like the top hospitals in the US, they're gonna put a leech on me? Well, depends on what you have. I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm not, I don't know, I've been looked into, but I'm just, I'm skeptical that a leech is the best we can do. You'd think that, but yeah, they do use that. You go to a snake bite, you put a leech on it. Exactly. If you had a leech handy, most people don't carry leeches on them.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:22:15.074 --> 0:22:15.495]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:16.980 --> 0:22:18.516]: 
  No, they still do that.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:22:22.650 --> 0:22:25.688]: 
  Well, depends on what you have.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:22:30.700 --> 0:22:31.004]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:22:31.004 --> 0:22:31.881]: 
  But yeah, then...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:22:31.881 --> 0:22:32.995]: 
  They do you a snake bite.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:32.995 --> 0:22:33.889]: 
  You could have leech on it.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:22:33.889 --> 0:22:34.497]: 
  Exactly.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:22:38.564 --> 0:22:59.489]: 
  You do, though. I do. You got to open his pocket on that, dude. When I'm walking around and Rytal Snake's biting me, I'm like, whatever dude, I got a leech right here. I'd like it if it bites the hand. It's like, stop snakes. It's like, whatever. You guys see the Rytal Snake bite on the internet? I don't want to see this. There was a guy who got bit on his index finger, and then his skin started rotting off. But then his bones started sticking out, and then he figured out that it was a rat.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:22:39.154 --> 0:22:42.074]: 
  I do, my little one. That's probably his pocket, little fully dynamite, dude.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:22:45.314 --> 0:22:49.937]: 
  when a wrecking a fort is and it bites the hand off and it picks up snakes and you do like whatever

 SPEAKER_04 [0:22:49.937 --> 0:22:53.110]: 
  Did you guys see the Rytal Snake bite on the internet? I don't want to see this. There was a guy who got...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:03.454 --> 0:23:13.208]: 
  bone and then the skin healed and I got a really short index finger. Oh my god! Why didn't you let his finger rot off before doing this? I don't know why he did it but America. There's that one video for sure.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:23:06.390 --> 0:23:07.200]: 
  Why did you let me go?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:08.804 --> 0:23:09.495]: 
  I don't know what's going on.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:09.495 --> 0:23:11.453]: 
  I don't know why he did it but um

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:12.685 --> 0:23:14.440]: 
  But what does that mean?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:14.440 --> 0:23:45.405]: 
  It was the guy who worked in a snake place and he didn't care. So it was just fascinating. There's one video of a guy or a woman maybe, I saw it a couple years ago, who lost their foot to something, but they kept it in a fucking freezer. Have you seen that video? No. They pulled out their fucking frozen foot with the boat. It was not cut off like peacefully. It was like a Halloween decoration. It looks like a joke, but it's a fucking foot with the boat and muscle and stuff. It's putrid. I never lost the foot and then scooped it at the inside and then taxed it and wore it like a shoe over their prosthetic leg.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:23:45.152 --> 0:23:47.262]: 
  That's a good idea.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:23:47.262 --> 0:24:11.241]: 
  That's a very common thing, Chris. It happens every day in the US. It's a huge problem. It's a huge epidemic. People scooping out their foot, you fucking maniac. What are you talking about? I know this sounds crazy, but I saw a video of a little kid riding his taxidermied dog. What are you riding? How can you ride that? It was like a little kid who was riding it and the mom was like, be careful of dog crushing and it fucking breaks it.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:23:57.488 --> 0:23:57.674]: 
  It's

 SPEAKER_03 [0:24:12.254 --> 0:25:27.752]: 
  fucking breaks its paw up and then falls over and is like HA HA HA Uh oh You're lying It's over It's over It's over It was on my own account and I favorite it It was the same fucking account that had the deaf guy kissing his dead grandma That's where it's at The account which is still in the video Real Do you know if I show you a video of the fucking This stuff, this is extra spooky for the season This fucking like 15 year old deaf man is like He's like doing silent which is like moaning, breathing heavily And he's like subtitling us at the bottom He's like the cemetery like closed down and they gave me my relatives and these caskets And most people when they get a fucking casket So I guess this guy got his grandfather and his great-grandmother and she died like 1945 Most people would fucking rebail it or relocate it Instead this man put it in his back yard and decided to fucking open it Mom been here I'll video He's like this is real He's like this is real He's like moaning and he's like this is my grandmother He must respect her she's so beautiful And he opens it up and she looks like Medusa Her hair is like fucking split back at her face Her face is green She looks like that one green girl from Nottingham Living Dead Yes Like a version of What's that amount of time? Like how the fuck

 SPEAKER_04 [0:24:20.252 --> 0:24:21.130]: 
  It was on my own ke-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:07.587 --> 0:25:11.552]: 
  I'm video. This is real. This is real. This is real.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:25:18.572 --> 0:25:21.509]: 
  Yeah. Split back at your face is green.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:25:24.900 --> 0:25:30.469]: 
  Like a version of it. With that amount of time here. Like how decompose it was. Not that much. Because, because I...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:28.444 --> 0:25:33.962]: 
  Not that much because she's been dead for 70 years and she's pretty well but the craziest one is...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:25:32.663 --> 0:25:36.460]: 
  The involving process makes no that is what it is. It's so

 SPEAKER_03 [0:25:34.941 --> 0:26:24.486]: 
  No, that is what it is. So that's not the worst part. So he's like, okay, let's take a look at her. And he opens it up and shows like a POV footage of her face. And then it cuts to like a still camera on a tripod. And it cuts, it's just a cat's getting here. He leaves it and starts kissing on the lips. The fucking dead woman for 70 years. He's like, he's getting worked up, like breathing heavily. But he's fucking deaf so he can't hear himself or gasping. He's like... She's like... She smells her and he fucking backs away. He smells her and she's fucking cocking, and cuts off. She's like a movie prop. She's too perfectly zombie like in green. Yeah, I know. I thought it was fake. I thought it was fake. And then he was in the comment section, people were like, this is fucking gross. He's insulting you. She's like, don't turn to the living dead. The girl is the real thing. Yeah, that's what we said, not the living dead. But when she gets pulled into the door, Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She doesn't have fucking...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:02.127 --> 0:26:04.658]: 
  He smells it, he's probably his cock and he cuts off.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:09.501 --> 0:26:09.771]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:14.243 --> 0:26:14.564]: 
  Thanks for watching.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:15.762 --> 0:26:19.879]: 
  She's like the return of the living dead, the girl that killed him. That's what he was saying. Yeah, that's what he was saying.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:21.837 --> 0:26:23.490]: 
  Oh yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:26:27.220 --> 0:26:47.639]: 
  Like he was commenting with people who were like, this is disgusting or horrible. He's kissing a fucking... Yeah, but he was like, there's nothing wrong with this. We've done this for years. This is family tradition. How dare you insult me? I'm sorry. The craziest thing is that this fucking maniacs first since he's with a 70 year old dead relative is the fucking you look at it. I mean, maybe the kill he asked you to get to. Yeah, he probably kind of...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:26:30.730 --> 0:26:32.738]: 
  He's, he's kissing a fucking...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:37.395 --> 0:26:39.134]: 
  I'm sorry. The crazies these days.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:26:47.639 --> 0:26:59.485]: 
  My friend's grandma died. He used to always like fuck with her because she had bad Alzheimer's and we were only kids I guess at the time. Like he used to like rewind the TV if someone would be coming down the stairs on the talk show and he'd rewind it so it'd be coming back up the stairs and she'd be like...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:26:59.485 --> 0:27:00.548]: 
  아~!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:00.497 --> 0:27:14.487]: 
  But anyway, then she died and they had her wake in their living room And he's like, look at this and they like pulled open her eyeballs and I've never been as terrified What did you see like I could still see her eye like it wasn't just the whites it was like it looked like she was looking at me

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:08.918 --> 0:27:09.930]: 
  What did you see?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:14.487 --> 0:27:18.132]: 
  What? Yeah. That stuff that like sticks with you forever. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:18.115 --> 0:27:24.544]:

 SPEAKER_01 [0:27:20.106 --> 0:27:20.494]: 
  That's what I'm talking about.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:20.494 --> 0:27:41.436]: 
  That's so fucking fucked up. Wait, Jazza! Jazza, you're a guy. Weren't you a Mormon? I was a Mormon. Speaking of religion, you're a priest. You're a Mormon? I was born and raised a Mormon. What's it like? It was, um, it depends on your perspective. I'm a... You're a real......dullable... Yes, I was legit. Yeah, I was supposed to what? I was legitimately in the Mormon religion. So what do you just use it as a tag? Tag or...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:24.983 --> 0:27:25.439]: 
  It was a movie.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:25.439 --> 0:27:26.451]: 
  We speak it religiously.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:27:34.484 --> 0:27:37.943]: 
  Yes, it's always legit. Yeah, it's always the one. Obviously legitimately.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:37.943 --> 0:27:39.006]: 
  in the moment really.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:37.994 --> 0:27:39.040]: 
  in the moment really.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:41.807 --> 0:27:48.540]: 
  Yeah, look, I think some people, sort of like with most religions, are raised in it and just go along with it because it's a social thing and it's easy.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:47.950 --> 0:27:48.962]: 
  and it's easy.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:27:48.540 --> 0:27:58.446]: 
  But like I don't know like I was pretty sincere about it and so like Did you do your passage or whatever it is? We have to like the missionary thing? Yeah, it was a missionary. What did you do?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:27:55.054 --> 0:27:59.982]: 
  or the missionary thing? Yeah, it was a missionary. So where'd you get that? Yeah, for 10 months. It's meant to be for two months.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:27:55.442 --> 0:27:56.016]: 
  or anything?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:02.648 --> 0:28:03.390]: 
  I needed them.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:03.492 --> 0:28:10.950]: 
  surgeries and after three surgeries that would you go to you stay in Australia yeah it's pretty random like I have a brother in law who went to Japan I have a

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:05.027 --> 0:28:05.939]: 
  Where did you go?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:10.950 --> 0:28:12.452]: 
  My brother's been to New Zealand.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:12.452 --> 0:28:32.989]: 
  to Sydney and Perth. Do you ever actually convert people when you're gone to their heart? Well the funny thing is these days not really. And when you do it's usually because either A. they're like a broken sort of person and they mean something to you. Or B. you make a connection with them. And because you become close they start to get really angry.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:18.797 --> 0:28:19.860]: 
  Well, the funny thing is...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:27.724 --> 0:28:29.361]: 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:34.947 --> 0:28:37.208]: 
  you're giving them because they respect you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:36.887 --> 0:28:52.581]: 
  I baptised three people. Two of them, a mother and son. And the reason that happened was because I became really good mates with this kid. He was like 15 at the time and it was because of Newgrounds. Because we started talking and hanging out. And he was like, wouldn't you be like,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:28:37.208 --> 0:28:37.950]: 
  Sorry, I'm gonna manipulate you.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:37.950 --> 0:28:38.119]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:28:49.510 --> 0:29:06.942]: 
  We started talking and hanging out and he was like he was like what did you do before we mission? I was like you know you're animating for new guys. Look you got new guys. Like yeah you like you're like we're like buddies so we go hang out on new grounds and yeah That's where we this is it dude that used to oh yeah, he's the quote Leo and say man. So um

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:55.264 --> 0:28:57.390]: 
  You guys are like, are you like, you guys are like,

 SPEAKER_02 [0:28:58.943 --> 0:29:02.959]: 
  So we go hang out on Newgrounds and that's where we is.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:06.942 --> 0:29:15.717]: 
  Yeah, so I baptized them basically because I could hang good friends with them. And then the other one was a guy who came over from China and had like no friends or family really.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:07.144 --> 0:29:08.933]: 
  Yeah, so I baptised them basically.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:15.497 --> 0:29:28.694]: 
  He's probably a community, right? Yeah, pretty much. Which is, again, like, sometimes... Yeah, sometimes it's weird. So, sometimes people do it. Join us on our baseball team or something. The Trae's guy at baseball team. Or something. What?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:18.062 --> 0:29:19.227]: 
  Yeah, pretty much.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:19.986 --> 0:29:22.905]: 
  Yeah, so those are for you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:29:28.694 --> 0:29:32.997]: 
  If you wanna make friends. Oh yeah. Well it says the thing when I left the chair.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:32.997 --> 0:29:38.937]: 
  You realize how much of your life is totally connected. Yes, so I left and I was

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:37.080 --> 0:29:37.502]: 
  Yes

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:38.937 --> 0:29:48.420]: 
  like oh my goodness I've no way to meet people I haven't got any social circles all my friends that I thought were good friends and I'd see them when I left nope never saw them again yeah so

 SPEAKER_03 [0:29:47.408 --> 0:29:56.166]: 
  Yeah, so what was what was the cracking points for you or points where you were more more than we like that's kind of peculiar That kind of the conflicts with my faith. Yes

 SPEAKER_00 [0:29:55.845 --> 0:30:06.004]: 
  Yes, there's this thing called cognitive dissonance, where when you come across something and it's not fitting, you have three options. You can either reject what you were presented with, which is different.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:30:06.004 --> 0:30:10.172]: 
  conflict. You reject what you have in favour of the new information.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:10.172 --> 0:30:27.992]: 
  Or you somehow adapt them and make them fit together, right? So everyone who's religious Comes across them, you know, especially the internet But most of my life would just push it away But in a year and a half before I left I started to like notice stuff and feel like weird about stuff or

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:21.546 --> 0:30:21.833]: 
  Bye.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:27.992 --> 0:30:34.439]: 
  decide that I felt like my feelings or natural inclinations were different to what I was taught to believe.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:33.527 --> 0:30:46.184]: 
  Yeah, so it just started to nag at me and I kept sort of gently pushing it away But it was always there and then like my response to all that was to become more moment So in fear of like more more. Yeah more more more

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:35.940 --> 0:30:36.008]: 
  I

 SPEAKER_00 [0:30:46.116 --> 0:30:53.609]: 
  More, more moment! So like, because I got, like, a bit depressed and stuff, my response was to...

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:49.575 --> 0:30:51.162]: 
  So like because I got like

 SPEAKER_02 [0:30:53.609 --> 0:30:59.987]: 
  to be super religious. And obviously if you do all the right things and you believe in the right religion, life will get better.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:31:03.447 --> 0:31:07.446]: 
  more religious and more unhappy and then literally one morning, it was a Wednesday morning.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:07.446 --> 0:31:13.437]: 
  I was like, I'm unhappy. Maybe I should think about this differently. And I just decided I would like think about it.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:13.437 --> 0:31:16.997]: 
  about it with an open mind, just think about whatever came to mind. See where I'm going.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:31:16.997 --> 0:31:28.439]: 
  I went in one hour, I went from being a lifetime 22 years of Mormon, total sincerity to, oh my goodness I'm not religious anymore.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:31:27.780 --> 0:32:49.624]: 
  Like it took one hour. Was there any like... What's your opinion? Ever be a Christian? Hahaha. Did you ever be a Christian? I was raised... My dad's side was Catholic, my mom's side was Protestant. So both sides were super, super religious. And they still are, which is fine. But some people in my family were the extreme side of... Kind of extremists. The Earth is 6,000 years old kind of people. Not all my family, but some people like that. So that was a big thing. I remember when I was probably 13, 14, 15, around my teenage years. I used to see people on the news, on YouTube make videos about why my religion was wrong. And I was getting upset, I get angry. But I feel this kind of primal fear of being like, oh what if I'm wrong? And so when I was like, you know what I'll do? I'll be the best debate-er ever. I'll learn their side first and then prove them wrong. And the more I started to uncover them, I was like, oh. That would be true. And the more I realized, I just didn't make any sense. But I feel like people who convert get a little bit of fear at first. Like I had a cousin who I used to talk to me a lot. And he's teeter between being a hardcore atheist and a hardcore Christian. And I think the biggest thing to prevent people from going all the way or exploring that is like a fear of like, what if I am wrong? Then life is for nothing because you're taught that there's a big afterlife and then the thought of like, it might not be there. That thought alone pushes a lot of people back out of fear only to be in our religion. And I feel like at some point I'm a lot happier now with the idea that life is, this is it. It makes it more important I think.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:31:47.102 --> 0:31:48.098]: 
  kind of extremists

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:13.630 --> 0:32:14.946]: 
  Oh, that's me too.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:32:14.946 --> 0:32:14.997]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:32:36.985 --> 0:32:37.305]: 
  later.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:32:49.506 --> 0:32:55.952]: 
  Yeah, I totally agree. And it's funny because when I left, I totally know what you're talking about because I went from a belief of structure to power.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:32:55.952 --> 0:33:01.960]: 
  and clarity. It was like okay so this life is for this reason this is a week before this happens after

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:00.019 --> 0:33:07.005]: 
  This happens after there are these kingdoms and you go here if this happens is very structured and you describe

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:07.005 --> 0:33:19.307]: 
  and you know what to expect. Then all of a sudden I had nothing and I had to figure out what I thought I felt knowing that I had no idea. I think it's free. I think free and at first it was terrifying.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:15.494 --> 0:33:18.497]: 
  I think it's free. I think free.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:33:19.274 --> 0:33:26.648]: 
  But then like in time like when you sort of climatize to it you do sort of realize that it actually makes here and now

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:19.307 --> 0:33:19.459]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:33:26.648 --> 0:34:01.545]: 
  more substantial right important yeah cuz you're not living for something yeah it's yeah no there's no way you're gonna this is the waiting room of the big of the big you know dentist office in the sky this is it this is like the waiting room is the is the dentist office or it's the life you get if you fuck up you live with it if you do well you live with it and that's you know that not to get to a this kind of stuff but I do think it's interesting because you know we don't I think it's the first person we've had like Mormon on the podcast which is interesting because all religious a little bit different but they all kind of similar in the way that people are taught and raised in the ideologies and stuff did your family today go crazy or were they they got crazy I had

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:30.310 --> 0:33:32.183]: 
  something else.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:33:51.353 --> 0:33:52.011]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:33:57.495 --> 0:33:57.765]: 
  Did you?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:00.162 --> 0:34:01.478]: 
  Don't go crazy, I had-

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:00.938 --> 0:34:04.802]: 
  I had the benefit of my dad leaving first.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:04.785 --> 0:34:19.011]: 
  So I come from a family of like quite a few siblings and my parents and Only my dad and I have left my dad left first and it was a bit more extreme So sort of softened the blow a bit. Yeah, but at the same time

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:16.041 --> 0:34:16.681]: 
  So, sort of...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:17.408 --> 0:34:24.951]: 
  blow a bit, but at the same time it also made it a bit scary I thought of my thing. Yeah it was going to come up. Yeah I didn't know what I would end up doing.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:21.103 --> 0:34:22.824]: 
  They were very good, I was gonna come up. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:22.994 --> 0:34:23.145]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:24.951 --> 0:34:28.444]: 
  I'm pretty emotionally aware guys, so when I was making this decision,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:28.444 --> 0:34:30.621]: 
  I thought okay so I've got to do this right so I'll

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:30.266 --> 0:34:32.005]: 
  So I spoke to everyone on my phone.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:32.005 --> 0:34:37.962]: 
  family but I also like made it very clear and made a huge effort to spend time and with my family and just like

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:37.962 --> 0:34:41.438]: 
  still show that like if I'm not religious it doesn't mean I don't think that

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:40.188 --> 0:34:40.695]: 
  I don't.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:41.438 --> 0:34:43.226]: 
  love is important. That's what I was going to say.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:34:42.045 --> 0:34:58.482]: 
  That's what I was gonna say, I think that's a big thing. People think... So where do your morals come from? Yeah, what are your morals if you don't believe in the afterlife? Well, it comes from the fact that this is the only thing. It's like, why spend your life being miserable and shitty? It's like, you might as well be nice and carry a big positive impact.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:44.762 --> 0:34:48.340]: 
  the end of it. So where do your morals come from?

 SPEAKER_00 [0:34:54.550 --> 0:34:54.768]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:34:58.094 --> 0:35:07.577]: 
  Yeah. So wait, so do Mormons have that thing in place? Like Jehovah's Witnesses were once a family member leaves the church? You're not really allowed to communicate with them anymore? Not really. There's no sort of like...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:07.577 --> 0:35:11.205]: 
  outcast system like Scientologists or J-Dubs. Yeah, they're called them.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:09.990 --> 0:35:16.943]: 
  Yeah, call them. But there is just the sort of social isolation that comes with leaving. Because to give you a chance to see what's going on, you can see that you're not going to be able to leave.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:15.492 --> 0:35:16.065]: 
  leave?

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:15.981 --> 0:35:15.998]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:16.943 --> 0:35:28.992]: 
  you an idea when I was 16 every school day I was at seminary in the morning at like 7 30 in the morning which is like for an hour and a half you like study like other teenagers so every school day then

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:17.449 --> 0:35:17.500]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:31.455 --> 0:35:33.936]: 
  Saturday there would have activities and then on Sunday there

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:33.936 --> 0:35:35.505]: 
  There was always church day and then you...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:35.505 --> 0:35:40.500]: 
  and use the stuff in the evening as well. So every day of the week was something. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:40.500 --> 0:35:41.648]: 
  So if you leave...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:41.648 --> 0:35:49.900]: 
  you're not involved in that and they are. Oh yes, so while you're not in the outclass, you kind of feel like one of those. Tenton just not seeing anyone.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:43.724 --> 0:35:45.445]: 
  Oh yes.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:44.449 --> 0:35:44.500]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_03 [0:35:45.445 --> 0:35:56.869]: 
  Yeah, you kind of feel like one of those. I just tend to just not see them anymore. I have to ask, are there still any types of people who have warrants that they're all really nice? Because I don't know, I don't know warrants that well. I still know.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:46.373 --> 0:35:46.440]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:55.620 --> 0:35:55.992]: 
  I see.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:55.992 --> 0:35:57.949]: 
  So, put it this way.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:35:57.949 --> 0:36:00.447]: 
  I saw the moment episode of South Bows.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:35:59.940 --> 0:36:01.493]: 
  I was gonna ask about that actually.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:00.447 --> 0:36:11.449]: 
  about that actually. And when I saw the book of Mormon musical, both times I was like, they nailed it. They nailed it? Great, did you see that episode where you were still religious? I saw the Mormon one, yeah. And I was like,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:02.978 --> 0:36:03.332]: 
  Yeah.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:36:05.239 --> 0:36:06.302]:

 SPEAKER_02 [0:36:10.673 --> 0:36:17.457]: 
  And I was a little bit like, because I found South Park funny, but it was a little tender, so I just, I didn't read into it too much. Really?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:12.158 --> 0:36:13.440]:

  Can I ask you a question? Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:36:21.659 --> 0:37:25.125]: 
  I mean this is legit. Are you confident? Are you willing to do things? Sometimes? Sometimes. Okay. Were you singing while I was working? Was that you singing? Yeah. You have a beautiful singing voice. Oh, the confrontation. We watched that. Can I go on this for just a second? Can I believe for just a second? Chris showed me maybe it's kind of by accident. We saw the movie first. We stole the part where we had no idea what the musical was at all. So we saw the film first and then we saw the feedback. We're like, why does everyone hate this movie? I don't get it. It's a great film. The soundtrack is great. Then we heard the musical and we were like, oh, okay. We've not seen or heard the lame-miss musical before the movie. No, no, no. We thought that we found it. Like two years ago, Chris found that episode. He came to check out this cool intro for this movie I saw. I was like, oh, and we loved it. We saw the whole thing. I'm glad I watched the movie first because it made me appreciate the musical way. I always advise people to do that. But anyways, I found, I was looking through YouTube videos of the 10th anniversary and all these other versions. And then your video popped up and I didn't know it was you. It was just there. I clicked it and I was like, holy fuck. That was a great video. I watch it every once in a while. See ya. Acting as well.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:36:21.810 --> 0:36:23.616]:

I thought you were playing an anime. I was gonna say, you wanna talk about theater a little bit? Because you're a theater boy. I'm a theater beast. Are you actually a theater? Yeah, that's where I met my wife, was really having a good time.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:37:35.048 --> 0:37:36.044]:

 SPEAKER_00 [0:38:01.440 --> 0:38:15.177]: 
  I've never done any theatre stuff but I thought I liked it because I like singing, you know, a bit goofy so. Yeah and then I did Carmen the musical. She was Carmen and I was Don Jose and then the next year we did Joseph and I was Joseph and she was in the radio.

If you're sitting there, you have a fucking erection and you know what? People aren't paying attention to that. They're paying attention to the like, the form. See, about that time when I was in the college and we were doing life drawing and there was an old man who used to come in like, getting eaten from. He had erection? He had a big boner, right? And I was like the only guy who was like, and everyone was like, you're fucking idiot. I was like, okay. Boners are funny. No, I was like, fair enough. I'm not being, no.

  you know if it's working or not. If they laugh, it's working. If they don't, it's not.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:40:56.046 --> 0:41:02.459]: 
  If they laugh, it's working. Yeah. If they don't, it's not working. You know what I mean? So there's a pretty immediate solution. You got all the reactions, innit?

 SPEAKER_03 [0:40:58.949 --> 0:41:21.342]: 
  You know what I mean? So there's a pretty immediate sort of reaction to it. Do you ever get that feeling that you put something on and you're terrified that you're not going to get the reaction you want? Oh yes. And you'll feel like a fucking asshole? Yeah, it's the worst feeling when you put a video and you're like, take a step and it was like, you know, I can put it off. Yeah, I can turn it on and do it. Do you ever see someone who's completely oblivious to that? Where you'll be at a party and some asshole will be like,

 SPEAKER_01 [0:41:02.391 --> 0:41:02.442]: 
  MBC 뉴스 이덕영입니다.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:41:09.985 --> 0:41:11.554]: 
  It's the worst.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:41:15.992 --> 0:41:16.499]: 
  I can turn on the camera.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:41:21.325 --> 0:41:26.573]: 
  Here guys, well, put on my friend's video. He made it. Really? Okay. And he's the only one left. He's the only one left.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:41:23.687 --> 0:42:04.997]: 
  You're like, okay. And he's the only one laughing. You swear. Haha, you're slick. Let's put it on the internet. I'm still telling you, it was like, no, what's that to you, that dude? I'm always like that. Like, I'm like, I feel like, and it's like when you put a video out, and like when I used to put out cartoons and stuff, I was like, I was like, oh, the judging eyes, man. Everyone's gonna fucking hate it. I'm gonna be ruined. I thought it was always like, I mean, anything I put out, I put out anything that has my name on it, I write my fucking name on it, I'm being judged. Everyone's scolding me for one mistake, but you know what? But the back of what you were saying, like, you know, it's, it's, it's, I've never done something because that's not comedy or tried to be comedy. So I don't know, what's that like for you? Because you, you know, you've done both. Yeah, it's interesting because,

 SPEAKER_04 [0:41:29.931 --> 0:41:31.146]: 
  Oh god. That dude.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:41:37.694 --> 0:41:38.250]: 
  I was like

 SPEAKER_04 [0:41:41.946 --> 0:41:44.730]: 
  I thought it was always like anything I put out.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:04.997 --> 0:42:08.490]: 
  I tried a bit of comedy.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:11.950 --> 0:42:18.801]: 
  of humour that just works, it's quite natural and I don't know, I've never been good at writing or at least executing humour.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:18.801 --> 0:42:21.940]: 
  And I feel like I can in some form, at least to what I enjoy,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:21.940 --> 0:42:24.437]: 
  but I don't think that's my thing. It was fun learning process.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:23.492 --> 0:42:26.445]: 
  fun learning process but yeah but on the flip side

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:26.445 --> 0:42:34.005]: 
  But the more serious stuff is kind of terrifying as well because you have to sort of get in a really vulnerable space and then to put it out there

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:33.449 --> 0:42:37.937]: 
  out there because it's if it's a sincere thing in your storytelling but it's also like a person

 SPEAKER_00 [0:42:37.448 --> 0:42:47.016]: 
  a personal thing. It's sort of a piece of you. So when you put it out there, it's not like they like it or they don't. It's they like me or they do.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:40.215 --> 0:42:40.890]: 
  it out there.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:44.384 --> 0:42:58.002]: 
  Yeah, they're like, yeah, it's it's it's almost the same kind of thing like with comedy It's like they laugh and they don't go with it The other thing it's kind of the same like they like it or they don't but it's more it is more personal It's kind of like it's it's yeah, like you said vulnerability is the key thing I think yeah, cuz it's

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:57.563 --> 0:42:58.997]: 
  Yeah, cause it kinda stems from like a motion.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:42:58.997 --> 0:43:26.132]: 
  Like I don't sometimes find things funny, but I can find it charming. Yeah, enjoyable. Yeah, enjoyable. I don't necessarily have to laugh at something to enjoy it, but laughing will help me enjoy it more. But there's a lot of stuff that people make that I legitimately find charming. And I mean, I tell them it's like, it was cute, but I fucking hated it. But I won't ever say that because it's me, dude. But that's what I'm thinking in my noggin. So you take cute, we know what you mean. Yeah, what I'm like, that was cute now.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:42:59.605 --> 0:42:59.672]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:43:02.609 --> 0:43:03.739]: 
  É.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:21.239 --> 0:43:21.947]: 
  So what you take care of is

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:24.951 --> 0:43:30.722]: 
  But I would never say that. So when I bend over, I would say that was cute. But I would never say that. You don't check me out at all.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:27.330 --> 0:43:39.801]: 
  But I would never say that. But I would never say that. Because I would, you know, I would also consider it. And I also, I'm not brainless. I'm not gonna be like, oh, this was some part of apartments coming from you. But that's the thing, because if you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:33.135 --> 0:43:34.452]: 
  That's the thing too.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:34.452 --> 0:43:34.722]: 
  Love it.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:38.907 --> 0:43:39.126]: 
  That's the...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:43:39.126 --> 0:43:41.438]: 
  because if you make a comedy and no one laughs

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:41.438 --> 0:43:43.935]: 
  they get the reality that it was a

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:43.935 --> 0:43:47.952]: 
  some part of the performance. But if you make something sincere and they say that was

 SPEAKER_02 [0:43:47.952 --> 0:43:56.254]: 
  cute and they think I fucking hate that they never get the feedback but they they never know what to think of it or what other people think of it anyway so yeah

 SPEAKER_03 [0:43:55.512 --> 0:44:33.497]: 
  Yeah, and I guess it also has like a double-edged sword because if you try to make something funny and someone's like oh, it's cute It's charming. It's like oh shit fuck. Yeah, that mean what's that is it on? I thought the Undertale game I thought it was very charming, but I thought it was chlorines fuck It had like these like old man dad jokes in it and it was just like I can't play this game these like puns I hate puns. It's like it's people's breading coffee to me. It's like it's like fucking nails in a chalkboard It's not just any old puns it's skeleton. It's yeah, it's fucking oh god. It's like how many fucking oh What are you fucking xylophone stop funny?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:21.989 --> 0:44:23.946]: 
  in a chop board.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:25.718 --> 0:44:25.971]: 
  It's...

 SPEAKER_01 [0:44:25.971 --> 0:44:26.258]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:33.447 --> 0:44:37.935]: 
  That is funny.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:36.855 --> 0:44:38.948]: 
  mexican

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:37.935 --> 0:44:41.294]: 
  You're the good old junk, you're the good old bonjo.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:44:42.745 --> 0:44:54.945]: 
  I think we hit in the middle in terms of what we take on because I think most of

 SPEAKER_03 [0:44:54.945 --> 0:45:05.695]: 
  as I know, can enjoy British humor and American humor. Probably more British humor, to be honest. I was gonna say, what do you, are you, are you a leader still? Do you think one is superior to the other? Do you think they're just kind of different? Um...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:44:58.962 --> 0:44:59.519]: 
  to be honest.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:05.442 --> 0:45:06.505]: 
  Ugh, it's...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:06.505 --> 0:45:12.495]: 
  rough because there are some really good American humour it just depends what you get so for example I

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:12.495 --> 0:45:26.755]: 
  who was in this boardroom meeting with a bunch of YouTubers and we were showing the premiere of a Netflix show. It was Kimmy Schmidt on Breakable Kimmy Schmidt, right? And it hadn't been shown anywhere yet. And there was 12 of us in this room. They put it on for us to like,

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:26.519 --> 0:45:32.931]: 
  show us their new company coming out soon it's really exciting and we all sat there in silence watching this company

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:31.244 --> 0:45:45.992]: 
  watching this coming. It was the most unfunny thing we were just like, you could have heard it ping drop. It was crazy. You'd like to have a story in there. I feel like some more, most of the modern American humour I haven't taken to.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:37.909 --> 0:45:40.744]: 
  He was crazy. She makes have a story of that.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:45:45.992 --> 0:45:49.992]: 
  I feel like some of the more old school stuff has been really good. You know what I mean? It's hard to be.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:45:48.608 --> 0:45:52.439]: 
  You know what I mean? It's hard to be happy with Simpson's in his peak. Yeah.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:45:49.992 --> 0:46:20.991]: 
  I think I think I think I think people like I saw a YouTube video a couple days ago Actually called like American humor versus British humor and they pulled me from family guy and then put next like peep shorts And come on don't do that dude put like curvy enthusiasm. Yeah, or something That's a good. That's a good really solid really like genuinely hilarious. That's like always studied Philadelphia Those two shows are like I think for the best American comedy Absolutely You can do it you can do it you can put fucking the big bang theory next thing it's like I was thing like between

 SPEAKER_01 [0:45:52.439 --> 0:45:52.945]: 
  I think I...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:45:52.945 --> 0:45:53.080]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:46:13.870 --> 0:46:15.625]: 
  Yeah, absolutely.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:23.961 --> 0:46:31.639]: 
  sweet spot for comedy in writing, in a movie. But the funny thing about British stuff is you sort of need to climatise to their tone.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:31.639 --> 0:46:33.495]: 
  If you watch the American Office,

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:35.031 --> 0:46:38.507]: 
  If you watched the American Office and then the British Office, back to the

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:38.507 --> 0:46:48.447]: 
  back they don't like the American office is like is much easier to sort of get into and understand the British office you have to sort of embrace the cringe

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:39.520 --> 0:46:41.562]: 
  Because of cancer

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:39.942 --> 0:46:40.937]: 
  Yeah

 SPEAKER_00 [0:46:44.667 --> 0:46:46.506]: 
  closer

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:48.447 --> 0:46:53.256]: 
  You have to understand that British humor. Yeah, they're really so uncomfortable. Yeah, there's

 SPEAKER_02 [0:46:50.489 --> 0:46:56.007]: 
  They're really like a little friendy shit. Yeah, there's really, but then when you sort of get it, it's like, it's hell of a deal.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:46:56.007 --> 0:47:11.076]: 
  hilarious yeah I prefer it actually yeah I'm gonna say like curb I know it's an American but it's kind of like a little bit based off British humor in no it's the opposite I don't think so the office came after Kirby Duzio it absolutely 100% you're looking at my window curcuma like you like it on

 SPEAKER_04 [0:46:58.015 --> 0:46:59.669]: 
  Yeah, me too. That's what I was gonna say, like...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:47:04.157 --> 0:47:04.495]: 
  It's the other way around.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:47:09.540 --> 0:47:14.198]: 
  When did Kirk come out? 1999. Oh, the Opsky Maps, 2001. But, but, but that's not the first- Kirk reduced humor.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:12.308 --> 0:47:21.437]: 
  But I'm saying, curb-a-thous, curb-a-thous? No it's not, but curb-a-thousiasm set the tone completely for handheld, free camera show like that it did. Really? 100% did.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:47:21.437 --> 0:47:23.952]: 
  I was talking more in terms of the humor.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:23.513 --> 0:47:31.984]: 
  No, because they get sidebook too. That's like sidebook you know, also you do reinvent the sitcom, but it definitely revolutionized it That's true. The office had like cringey stuff in it, but it was

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:28.980 --> 0:47:29.352]: 
  true.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:28.997 --> 0:47:29.250]: 
  That's true.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:47:34.448 --> 0:48:05.717]: 
  and they like the British are like the British I don't think there's a distinction but like I said you could to put to put It's apples oranges to put family guy to keep sure Point is P I feel like this simps is put site, but put Curbidusia's but it's always said in Philadelphia I love my G. I'm good. Well, take it all like British counties like they don't paste their cringe It's just cringe cringe cringe cringe and it tires you at the end of a real Can be exhausting. Yeah, it's asked me when I watch stuff like that

 SPEAKER_01 [0:47:35.680 --> 0:47:36.591]: 
  Yes, like the bridge.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:47:36.591 --> 0:47:37.907]: 
  Nobody just does the distinction.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:42.750 --> 0:47:44.590]: 
  We'll probably tell you when we put family out.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:47:43.004 --> 0:47:43.442]: 
  We thought we'd tell you.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:47:44.590 --> 0:47:45.450]: 
  We're father Ted would have

 SPEAKER_00 [0:47:45.349 --> 0:47:46.446]: 
  From the helpDIVICATIVE!

 SPEAKER_02 [0:47:50.513 --> 0:47:53.854]: 
  I thought it was good. I think I know. I was enjoying my tea crap. I love my tea crap, yeah.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:02.005 --> 0:48:03.962]: 
  It can be exhausting.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:05.717 --> 0:48:15.437]: 
  That sketch you showed me before where it was like the guy keeps knocking over the shelf. Was that Australian? I don't know. No, that was American. That was funny.

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:12.619 --> 0:48:22.002]: 
  No, that was a bit... that was... that was a... I think it was the stage. Oh man, that was so funny. I thought that was Australian music. Yeah, that was the stage.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:48:14.948 --> 0:48:15.606]: 
  Sorry.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:21.495 --> 0:48:31.688]: 
  That was the set. That was the... There's not much in the way of memorable or enjoyable Australian content, I think. And I hate... there's not much I hate more than an Australian accent in media. Oh, really?

 SPEAKER_04 [0:48:22.002 --> 0:48:22.744]: 
  That was uh...

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:31.215 --> 0:48:33.915]: 
  Oh really? Yeah, sticks out when I still thumb it. I like that stuff.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:31.452 --> 0:48:31.502]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [0:48:33.004 --> 0:48:41.003]: 
  I like that. I used to watch House, I liked it. But every time it was a chase, I was like, oh, jeez. Yeah, every time he spoke, I was like, ah, it's gross. Like, it's like, I don't know.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:36.767 --> 0:48:38.877]: 
  Change, europe, country, you know One thing that I wasn怎麼樣

 SPEAKER_03 [0:48:41.003 --> 0:49:30.143]: 
  We sound so lazy I don't like the stereotype I don't like the stereotype of like We should check the temperature and the temperature It's weird to hear an American person like a British show or like a British or Australian person in an American show Cause if it goes like hey I'm using my iPhone here to do my taxes Go to your fucking I can't feel that way about certain Irish things where like a lot of Irish humor comes from the Irish accent Yeah, forced Irish humor There's a lot of sketches in Ireland where it's just like the joke is that they're saying something in an Irish accent Yeah, and it drives me fucking crazy That's like Irish humor is like Oh would you give way over that man? Yeah, yeah, that's the humor It's like oh my mom does that I think that's a good rule If you can rewrite a joke in a different accent and it's still funny that the joke itself is good That's the thing, and they're like popular black people The father Ted just writes stuff so fucking good That's great, yeah

 SPEAKER_04 [0:48:46.251 --> 0:48:48.732]: 
  We should check his temperature and tell him.

 SPEAKER_00 [0:48:48.732 --> 0:48:50.436]: 
  It's really too... Come on, it's...

 SPEAKER_04 [0:48:50.436 --> 0:48:50.740]: 
  It's really...

 SPEAKER_00 [0:49:04.830 --> 0:49:05.995]: 
  Yeah, four stars, you're amazing.

 SPEAKER_01 [0:49:05.995 --> 0:49:06.602]: 
  It's the worst.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:49:11.310 --> 0:49:18.516]: 
  Yeah, that drives me fuck. That's like Irish humor is like Yeah, yeah, that's the humor it's like oh my mom does that get it. I think it's a good idea

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:23.072 --> 0:49:25.401]: 
  The joke itself is a good thing.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:26.144 --> 0:49:26.667]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:28.405 --> 0:49:34.935]: 
  It's great. There are popular comedians that rely on their accent and that's really annoying. Like Scottish comedians.

 SPEAKER_02 [0:49:35.594 --> 0:49:43.508]: 
  Yeah. All they do is like, Well, the other day I was here for a friend that did a fart and oh, and people like that. That's pretty good.

 SPEAKER_04 [0:49:42.900 --> 0:49:43.643]:

There was not but me who could intercede that Moses made three days for my youth. Then I would turn and pledge my word.

I want to take a pen and fucking jab it until it talks. It does that and it expands its fucking throat. It's disgusting. They're frog monkeys. If those would extinct, I would feel nothing. I kind of hope they do. They're just- they're not gross. What about spider? I hope there's a video of guys that killing my firing squad. That's the fucking- ooh, the last ooh. They're gonna do- ooh. All God's creatures are beautiful. Not the fucking frog throat thing. Not just skin-o's. God woke up early at 2am and he was really drunk. He was like, ooh. He wrote that down and made it. Even tapeworms are beautiful. Eps- gross. No, absolutely not. Tapeworms are gonna say it's the funniest. Zach, do you hear him? He puts your gun at the tip of your tongue and tapeworms are probably- I told you, it's not true. It's true, Eric. They have to put tapeworms on a tiny, substantial track. God made parasites.

  Would you rob your sister's head and your mom's body?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:10.238 --> 1:08:23.282]: 
  It's on her head. Which place? Sister's head, on your mom's head. On top, resting on top, like instead of her head. Yeah, it's like a total war instead of her head.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:08:19.096 --> 1:08:21.662]:

  No, on top of the head.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:08:32.377 --> 1:08:32.444]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:50.890 --> 1:08:51.447]: 
  Definitely should.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:08:51.447 --> 1:08:59.294]: 
  Really? I would do the mob thing, unless they call you up. The rainbow socks are like knee-high. I'd be afraid because what if I liked it so much I did it every day.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:55.412 --> 1:08:56.813]: 
  The rainbow socks are like knee-high.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:08:58.956 --> 1:09:35.591]: 
  I can do it in private. I can super work and just animate at home. It's true. No one would know. What video do you think it would like to tour so much? You fall over the... Did you ever do that? I could just... Did you ever film a drama chapter in your underwear? No, I filmed one topless. Really? Yeah, I was on Valentine's Day. I'd be dangerous. I get a big old ball of blood. I thought that would be a really good idea. Is that the one when you animated the boobs? No, that was a different one. Oh yeah, I've done three boob videos. I like the one. I controlled myself. Do they somehow... They're popular. Coincidence League. Do they coincidentally have more views than the other videos? Yeah, they do. That's why I'm saying like, I have done three. That's like, I'm no... Because every time I've done it, like, it's a choice. Because it's like, oh... Business decision.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:02.500 --> 1:09:09.721]: 
  I don't know, it is a good tool so much. Why did you fall over the width? Did you ever do that? Did you ever fill the drawer with jazz in your underwear?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:12.877 --> 1:09:16.725]: 
  I like that. I'd be dangerous. I'd get a big one. I'd be a really good idea.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:17.451 --> 1:09:19.694]: 
  the boobs.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:20.792 --> 1:09:21.939]: 
  I like the coffee.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:21.939 --> 1:09:24.640]: 
  I've shown myself. Do they somehow correct their popular?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:24.640 --> 1:09:25.872]: 
  Go into that solution.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:09:29.162 --> 1:09:29.888]: 
  I'm sad like I have to

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:34.292 --> 1:09:38.493]: 
  business decision I think I need some more views but the same like I try and add some stuff

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:38.493 --> 1:09:42.493]:

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:42.493 --> 1:09:51.301]: 
  I do one boom video a year basically. You ever get a hold of it while you're dry? Like have to pause the video? Pause the tutorial you'll talk about? No, no, no. Okay, no I don't.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:09:49.733 --> 1:09:55.943]: 
  No, I don't. I turned myself on with my own joy. Did you get the same thing? Did everyone else do that?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:09:53.834 --> 1:10:06.895]: 
  If I only you like the same thing, did everyone else do it? Yeah, I get that all the time, but it's like, why, if I did jerk off to it, how is this reassuring to you? He's like, oh, he does. I knew it, I'm gonna tell everybody. It's like, who cares if it's fun? No one's gonna care.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:09:55.943 --> 1:09:57.445]: 
  I get that all the time, but it's like...

 SPEAKER_04 [1:09:57.445 --> 1:09:57.951]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:10:58.718 --> 1:11:03.392]: 
  Yeah legs are way worse than legs.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:06.717 --> 1:11:11.442]: 
  Lays are confusing. Corey, when you were doing that street fighter video, did you just make up the muscles or are they actually real?

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:11.442 --> 1:11:37.463]: 
  I couldn't tell it was kind of like it was weird because there was at one point where I didn't understand anatomy at all And by the end of the cartoon you started realizing it was like oh There's muscle structure if you look at the cartoon it starts off this like disgusting circle arms at the horrible I mean like you start seeing form and then I actually Was like the course of like six months and I learned a lot of things in six months

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:20.942 --> 1:11:22.934]: 
  You just started learning? There's muscle structure.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:11:29.481 --> 1:11:31.472]: 
  then that she can use kids by

 SPEAKER_02 [1:11:37.952 --> 1:11:44.027]: 
  between the main muscles and you know what I mean? But if you learn like there's the bicep and the tricep and how those shapes look.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:11:44.027 --> 1:12:11.939]: 
  then you leave gaps for the other bits. This is like, you understand that there's kind of like three parts of the arm, there's one, two, three, you understand that eventually, and then you understand that there's two here. So the shoulders are like a kind of upside-down tear drop going down. And then from there you can kind of find two parts. Well all it could have fallen to was like chaotic, it's not like there's pieces floating in your arm. You could also kind of, if you don't have like, cellulite's on your arm or whatever. Did you ever, when you were a kid and you were learning to draw, you had no concept of Nami?

 SPEAKER_00 [1:11:46.474 --> 1:11:46.761]: 
  Sweet.

  you draw something really muscly, you just add more like gorgeous. Yeah, just more.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:14.132 --> 1:12:55.493]: 
  I have a very distinct memory. I don't know why it's so distinct I think I must have been traumatized by it, but a kid was trying to go through a buff He drew like I'm not joking by six biceps on it That's not right Because it's a good thing it is I just were looking at it like yeah I'm like that way you'd be like yeah, I keep my guy at 20 pack Yeah And they have like tiny fucking arms like they're like aren't their hands are puny They're they're like fucking jelly beans compared to his huge fucking basketball muscle Man because I used to draw I used to the same thing I used to draw like 12 packs I didn't understand that you know in the most you like yeah, the more books you get more packs you grow It's just comes

 SPEAKER_04 [1:12:15.938 --> 1:12:17.288]: 
  I have a very good stake.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:25.574 --> 1:12:25.692]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:12:25.692 --> 1:12:26.451]:

 SPEAKER_00 [1:12:26.451 --> 1:12:28.004]: 
  That's not right. You fucked up...

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:28.004 --> 1:12:29.995]: 
  I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry about that.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:12:29.995 --> 1:12:31.227]: 
  I was still yet it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:30.872 --> 1:12:31.429]: 
  We had it.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:12:35.479 --> 1:12:37.859]: 
  Yeah, I keep my guy at 20 pack.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:12:42.246 --> 1:12:42.330]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_02 [1:12:42.330 --> 1:12:42.364]: 
  you

 SPEAKER_04 [1:12:52.472 --> 1:12:53.957]: 
  Yeah, the more po- if she gets the more pay.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:12:56.117 --> 1:13:56.496]: 
  But you know what, you're gonna be fucking stupid? Well, you'll have a 20-pack fucking pussy. Or like those people who like have a picture, I'm not calling it one out, but people who have a picture and they draw details in the picture that don't really, aren't important. They're trying to be... Like, yeah, like dense in the body where like, you people would draw a line to kind of figure out where it is, but there's like the lines connected to the belly button or like these weird details on the arm. It's like, dude, you have to do that. It's clearly a physical cartoon-y side. I feel like part of stuff within that of me, and I'm, again, a little expert, for what I understand, there seems to be different compartments of it, right? Like, what is understanding where they are? Number two is understanding how they work together, what they are. And three is knowing what to simplify and what not to draw. Simplifying is a period of work. Like, if you drew everything in that cartoon, it looked disgusting. So it's how much should I exaggerate the bison? How much should I really draw necklines and a girl? If it's not, you know what I mean? So it's a weird... It's not just knowing that. I mean, it's knowing it, but we want to simplify, knowing we're to exclude. I'm sorry, I tried drawing you once, but it's hard.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:18.915 --> 1:13:19.506]: 
  It's...

 SPEAKER_04 [1:13:19.506 --> 1:13:21.295]: 
  I feel like

 SPEAKER_02 [1:13:20.164 --> 1:13:20.181]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:13:36.449 --> 1:13:38.828]: 
  not to draw.

 SPEAKER_01 [1:13:56.496 --> 1:14:00.006]: 
  I'm gonna try to draw a perfect circle. Boy, fucking punch, Cory.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:13:58.184 --> 1:14:01.575]: 
  It's a coin. Coin. They're fucking punch

 SPEAKER_04 [1:14:00.006 --> 1:14:01.305]: 
  Corridor, tired of guys.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:02.453 --> 1:14:30.938]: 
  It is really hard to draw a perfect circle like me. Especially with the goiter. I know. You have to keep in mind that there's like a raindrop underneath that all point. Dory was a joke. Yeah, goiter did. It was a double joke. Are you saying he's a double chin? Coint, you're attacking right now. Coint, kick him with a fucking bow. No. Coint, I double goshed her. No. I got a double chin. I'm getting way. Goiters are... Here's the problem with goiters. Goiters. Goiters. When you look down, when you look down, and you're rocking a goiter, that's bad.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:20.391 --> 1:14:22.450]: 
  I'm getting wiggled

 SPEAKER_02 [1:14:25.690 --> 1:14:27.107]: 
  Glitters.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:14:31.613 --> 1:14:52.538]: 
  The CPSA? Well, if you're a goiter and you're just sitting there talking and having a good time and you're not looking down, you got a goiter and that's not a good thing. So both of those things are bad. If you're a decadent, if you're a head forward, if you're a head like that and you've smelled some cheesecake or something, you've got a fucking goiter, turn your head away and we'll go to the treadmill. Climbed off with a pair of scissors.

What about the gunshot and the guy who said it sounded like a watermelon exploded on him? That was the guy, that was the sound of a guy threw a mechanical pencil at him.

His fucking head exploded and the car raced away.

  What would you do if you woke up? Kids puke because they're fucking six years old with base-kitty nebulous. What would you do if you woke up and someone had surgically changed your head to look like cream the rabbit? Girl would you kill yourself or would you live with cream the rabbit? I would take pic- I would go to conventions, wearing nothing, completely naked, and I'd be like, have that at boys. You'd just like boys for good, fuck you at conventions. Boy, it's still you, your body's yours. You'd have to like, mantan his ears. Who would still fight me because of cream the rabbit? No, but you've got like, creepy stitches all off the side of your head. Thank you, but like, cream the rabbit. It's not like face-off words, sea-whiz, it looks like a fucking bucket. It's like what we said, the My Little Pony girls are real. They come to- What? What do you mean like we said? What a fucking real music is this, boy? They come to New York Times Square. They time travel in the center of a big Brody convention. The Brody see it, they fucking attack, they rip them, win them, win. Grab the pussy, grab the hoops, grab the channel, and rip them into pieces. You say, you say, Taurus do this to the ponies? This is what would happen if Ronys got a little pony. No, of course, what I'm saying is that- This is what happened in a convention. You don't look like cream the rabbit. You look like someone got a bunch of pig meat and stitched it into the shape of cream the rabbit. You didn't say that. I did. You didn't specify that I'm like- That's what I'm saying. I'm cream the rabbit, abortion, fame, fame. Yeah, this is absolutely insane. You look like- I would still do it. Somebody would fuck me. Somebody would walk over to you with a plastic and rub it against you and look at them and they'd get shy.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:19:45.437 --> 1:20:29.835]: 
  Any more questions to ask us? By the way, they can only be Sonic related Don't fuck this up. If it's not so good. I will storm off. I will jump out the window They don't have to be Sonic related. What are the rules of this Sonic religion? Porn, sex, drugs, pussy, all me, I'm the king of the religion. Anybody else who does those things? I get to kill my own hands. Really one-sided religions? I paint little boys and Sonic get blue face. Dude, you can really return. What? I'm Dr. Ridley. I'm Jesus. You're the alligator. At the time I would do a side church with blue face paint. I'd hold my hands out like the guy from American History X. And they all started about worshiping me and praying to me. I said whoever gets to suck my dick becomes the second Sonic.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:19:57.992 --> 1:19:58.144]:

  I don't know.

 SPEAKER_02 [1:20:30.561 --> 1:20:53.460]: 
  I don't know that much about Sonic, so I can just put it loose. Oh, I'm the loser. No, I've never gotten Sonic on. There was this one guy on you who did nothing but Sonic, Haradies, cartoons and games. And for like 5, 6 years, and this is like ages ago, but like that's all he did. I didn't understand it. I'm like, first of all, how can something be that entertaining to someone for that long? I know.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:20:32.940 --> 1:20:34.442]: 
  Oh, I'm the leader of the video.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:20:34.442 --> 1:20:38.391]: 
  No, I've never gotten Sonic on. Yeah, yeah. I know you've never. Yeah, sorry. There was just one.

 SPEAKER_04 [1:20:36.450 --> 1:20:36.501]: 
  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_03 [1:20:52.701 --> 1:21:53.704]: 
  Second of all, it's Sonic. It's boring. How's it? He goes fast. Viet. Sonic is like cut and dry when he was boring, fucking. It's like the game is fun. Everything else. I never even cared about that. Yeah, games are even made. Like, no, some of them are okay. And the art style, like I'm feeling it's a good design. You need to grow up with it. It's like something like... I grew up with it. I just didn't like it. You need it to get invested in it. I think it's a cool universe. It's literally something that you have to have a little design. You have to push through dislodged. It's Mega Man for me. I played Mega Man and did not like it. I played the other Mega Man games and did not like it. But it's like everyone's like, oh, Mega Man, it's a great thing. It's like Sonic. It's like you grew up with Sonic and you forced yourself through all the bullshit. That sounds really dumb. You become really circular. Like, jazz, like, oh, oh, I am. Gullik and my hot fucking anime squares and the different shades of gray. Okay, no one fucking cares. 50 Shades of Gray is a fucking rape novel, all right? This is important. Yeah, let's see his song. Hello, my name is Elder Brooks.

  You mean the odd stuff? Like I'm gonna kill you?

 SPEAKER_01 [1:21:11.905 --> 1:21:14.571]: 
  It's like something like- I grew up with it, I just did like it.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:15.904 --> 1:21:17.625]: 
  I think it's a cool universe.

 SPEAKER_00 [1:21:18.486 --> 1:21:20.494]:

 SPEAKER_02 [1:21:20.494 --> 1:21:21.540]:
